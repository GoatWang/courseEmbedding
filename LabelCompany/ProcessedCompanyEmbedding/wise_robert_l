the academy of motion picture arts and sciences from  through  often contrasted with auteur directors such as stanley kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial look to a particular genre wise has been viewed as a craftsman inclined to let the sometimes studioassigned story concept set the style later cineastes such as martin scorsese insist that despite wises legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify wise as an artist and not merely an artisan wise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres horror noir western war science fiction musical and drama with many repeat successes within each genre wises meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated by studio budget constraints but advanced the moviemaking art robert wise received the afi life achievement award in  contents  early years  early career

journalism and following graduation from high school attended franklin college a small liberal arts college south of indianapolis indiana on a scholarship in  due to the familys poor financial

gone to hollywood several years earlier and worked at rko pictures found his younger brother a job in the shipping department at rko wise worked odd jobs at the studio before moving into editing early careeredit wise began his movie career at rko as a sound and music editor in the s rko was a small budgetminded studio with a strong work ethic and willingness to take artistic risks which was fortunate for a newcomer to hollywood such as wise at rko wise became an assistant to tk wood the studios head soundeffects editor wises first screen credit was a tenminute short subject called a trip through fijiland  which was made from rko footage salvaged from an abandoned feature film as wise gained experience he became more interested in editing film content rather than sound and went to work for rko film editor william billy hamilton wises first film as hamiltons assistant was alfred santells winterset  wise continued to work with hamilton on other films including stage door  careful  having wonderful time  and the story of vernon and irene castle  in the hunchback of notre dame  and fifth avenue girl  hamilton and wise as assistant film editor shared screen credit it was wises

award for film editing wise was the films last living crew member although wise worked as an editor on citizen kane it is likely that while working on the film he became familiar with the optical printer techniques employed by linwood dunn inventor of the practical optical printer to produce effects for citizen kane such as the image projected in the broken snowglobe which falls from kanes hand as he dies though wise was never known as a specialeffectsdriven director echoes of this s hightech special effects technology were to emerge in several of his important later films such as the day the earth stood still  west side story  the andromeda strain  and star trek the motion picture citation needed in citizen kane welles used a deepfocus technique in which heavy lights are employed to achieve sharp focus for both foreground and background in the frame wise later used the technique in films that he directed welless citizen kane also influenced wises innovations in the use of sound in films such as the setup  where wise limited music to infilm sources and in executive suite  which used no music in addition biographical films or biographical profiles of fictionalized characters such as kane were often the subjects of wises later work including somebody up there likes me  i want to live  the sound of music  so big  run silent run deep  and the sand pebbles  among others wise also worked as editor on welless next film for rko the magnificent ambersons  while working as a film editor wise was called on to shoot additional scenes for the film after welles was dismissed from the studio wise continued editing films such as seven days leave  bombardier  and the fallen sparrow  before he received his first directing assignment director and produceredit for wise connecting to the viewer was the most important part of making a film wise also had a reputation for a strong work ethic and budgetminded frugality in addition he was known for his attention to detail and wellresearched preparation for a film for example before directing until they sail  set in new zealand during world war ii wise traveled to new zealand to interview women whose lives were similar to those portrayed in the film wises attention to detail also extended to foreign locales while in new zealand doing research for the film wise also scouted background shots for the films secondunit crew even though the main film was shot on mgms back lot in california he also shot films on location such as mystery in mexico  a minor bmovie thriller filmed in mexico city wises films

against tomorrow  the sand pebbles  featured the story of a biracial couple and jewish characters were included in somebody up there likes me  the day the earth stood still  and the house on telegraph hill  at rko wise got his first credited directing job in  while working for hollywood horror film producer val lewton wise replaced the original director on the horror film the curse of the cat people  when it fell behind schedule the film a well received dark fantasy about a solitary child and her imaginary friend was a departure from the horror films of the day in many of wises films but especially in curse of the cat people and audrey rose  the melodrama used a vulnerable child or childlike character to challenge a dark adult world lewton promoted wise to his superiors at rko beginning a collaboration that produced the notable horror film the body snatcher  starring boris karlof with bela lugosi the films stylization and atmosphere deliberately evoked the groundbreaking horror films of the s while presenting a psychological horror film more in tune with the uncertainty of the scitation needed wise identified the film as a personal favorite and its rave reviews also helped establish his career as a director between curse and snatcher wise directed mademoiselle fifi  an adaptation of two guy de maupassant short stories that explored mans darker side with a political subtext fifis feminist perspective and a memorable chase sequence helped make it a template picture for wise wise also directed film noir among them the lawrence tierney noir classic born to kill  and blood on the moon  a noir western starring robert mitchum as a cowboy drifter that included memorable night sequences wises last film for rko the setup  was a realistic well researched boxing movie in which wise exposed the sports cruel and exploitative nature the film also included choreographed fight scenes and set the bar for other fight films the film earned the critics prize at the cannes film festival wises use and mention of time in this film would echo in later noir films such as stanley kubricks the killing  and quentin tarantinos pulp fiction  in the s wise proved adept in several genres including science fiction in the day the earth stood still  melodrama in so big  western in tribute to a bad man  starring james cagney fictionalized biography in the boardroom drama executive suite  and the epic helen of troy  based on homer three secrets  a soap operafamily melodrama gave wise a chance to work with actress patricia neal in a landmark performance about gender

sciences from  through  often contrasted with auteur directors such as stanley kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial look to a particular genre wise has been viewed as a craftsman inclined to let the sometimes studioassigned story concept set the style later cineastes such as martin scorsese insist that despite wises legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify wise as an artist and not merely an artisan wise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres horror noir western war science fiction musical and drama with many repeat successes within each genre wises meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated

editing work was on bachelor mother  and my favorite wife  at rko wise worked with orson welles on citizen kane  and was nominated for the academy award for film editing wise was the films last living crew member although wise worked as an editor on citizen kane it is likely that while working on the film he became familiar with the optical printer techniques employed by linwood dunn inventor of the practical optical printer to produce effects for citizen kane such as the image projected in the broken snowglobe which falls from kanes hand as he dies though wise was never known as a specialeffectsdriven director echoes of this s hightech special effects technology were to emerge in several of his important later films such as the day the earth stood still  west side story  the andromeda strain  and star trek the motion picture citation needed in citizen kane welles used a deepfocus technique in which heavy lights are employed to achieve sharp focus for both foreground and background in the frame wise later used the technique in films that he directed welless citizen kane also influenced wises innovations in the use of sound in films such as the setup  where wise limited music to infilm sources and in executive suite  which used no music in addition biographical films or biographical profiles of fictionalized characters such as kane were often the subjects of wises later work including somebody up there likes me  i want to live  the sound of music  so big  run silent run deep  and the sand pebbles  among others wise also worked as editor on welless next

working for hollywood horror film producer val lewton wise replaced the original director on the horror film the curse of the cat people  when it fell behind schedule the film a well received dark fantasy about a solitary child and her imaginary friend was a departure from the horror films of the day in many of wises films but especially in curse of the cat people and audrey rose  the melodrama used a vulnerable child or childlike character to challenge a dark adult world lewton promoted wise to his superiors at rko beginning a collaboration that produced the notable horror film the body snatcher  starring boris karlof with bela lugosi the films stylization and atmosphere deliberately evoked the groundbreaking horror films of the s while presenting a psychological horror film more in tune with the uncertainty of the scitation needed wise identified the film as a personal favorite and its rave reviews also helped establish his career as a director between curse and snatcher wise

inclined to let the sometimes studioassigned story concept set the style later cineastes such as martin scorsese insist that despite wises legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify wise as an artist and not merely an artisan wise achieved critical success as a director

crew member although wise worked as an editor on citizen kane it is likely that while working on the film he became familiar with the optical printer techniques employed by linwood dunn inventor of the practical optical printer to produce effects for citizen kane such as the image projected in the broken snowglobe which falls from kanes hand as he dies though wise was never known as a specialeffectsdriven director echoes of this s hightech special effects technology were to emerge in several of his important later films such as the day the earth stood still  west side story  the andromeda strain  and star trek the motion picture citation needed in citizen kane welles used a deepfocus technique in which heavy lights are employed to achieve sharp focus for both foreground and background in the frame wise later used the technique in films that he directed welless citizen kane also influenced wises innovations in the use of sound in films such as the setup  where wise limited music to infilm sources and in executive suite  which used no music in addition biographical films or biographical profiles of fictionalized characters such as kane were often the subjects of wises later work including somebody up there likes me  i want to live  the sound of music  so big  run silent run deep  and the sand pebbles  among others wise also worked as editor on welless next

working for hollywood horror film producer val lewton wise replaced the original director on the horror film the curse of the cat people  when it fell behind schedule the film a well received dark fantasy about a solitary child and her imaginary friend was a departure from the horror films of the day in many of wises films but especially in curse of the cat people and audrey rose  the melodrama used a vulnerable child or childlike character to challenge a dark adult world lewton promoted wise to his superiors at rko beginning a collaboration that produced the notable horror film the body snatcher  starring boris karlof with bela lugosi the films stylization and atmosphere deliberately evoked the groundbreaking horror films of the s while presenting a psychological horror film more in tune with the uncertainty of the scitation needed wise identified the film as a personal favorite and its rave reviews also helped establish his career as a director between curse and snatcher wise

sciences from  through  often contrasted with auteur directors such as stanley kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial look to a particular genre wise has been viewed as a craftsman inclined to let the sometimes studioassigned story concept set the style later cineastes such as martin scorsese insist that despite wises legendary workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify wise as an artist and not merely an artisan wise achieved critical success as a director

crew member although wise worked as an editor on citizen kane it is likely that while working on the film he became familiar with the optical printer techniques employed by linwood dunn inventor of the practical optical printer to produce effects for citizen kane such as the image projected in the broken snowglobe which falls from kanes hand as he dies though wise was never known as a specialeffectsdriven director echoes of this s hightech special effects technology were to emerge in several of his important later films such as the day the earth stood still  west side story  the andromeda strain  and star trek the motion picture citation needed in citizen kane welles used a deepfocus technique in which heavy lights are employed to achieve sharp focus for both foreground and background in the frame wise later used the technique in films that he directed welless citizen kane also influenced wises innovations in the use of sound in films such as the setup  where wise limited music to infilm sources and in executive suite  which used no music in addition biographical films or biographical profiles of fictionalized characters such as kane were often the subjects of wises later work including somebody up there likes me  i want to live  the sound of music  so big  run silent run deep  and the sand pebbles  among others wise also worked as editor on welless next

working for hollywood horror film producer val lewton wise replaced the original director on the horror film the curse of the cat people  when it fell behind schedule the film a well received dark fantasy about a solitary child and her imaginary friend was a departure from the horror films of the day in many of wises films but especially in curse of the cat people and audrey rose  the melodrama used a vulnerable child or childlike character to challenge a dark adult world lewton promoted wise to his superiors at rko beginning a collaboration that produced the notable horror film the body snatcher  starring boris karlof with bela lugosi the films stylization and atmosphere deliberately evoked the groundbreaking horror films of the s while presenting a psychological horror film more in tune with the uncertainty of the scitation needed wise identified the film as a personal favorite and its rave reviews also helped establish his career as a director between curse and snatcher wise

fantasy about a solitary child and her imaginary friend was a departure from the horror films of the day in many of wises films but especially in curse of the cat people and audrey rose  the melodrama used a vulnerable child or childlike character to challenge a dark adult world lewton promoted wise to his superiors at rko beginning a collaboration that produced the notable horror film the body snatcher  starring boris karlof with bela lugosi the films stylization and atmosphere deliberately evoked the groundbreaking horror films of the s while presenting a psychological horror film more in
