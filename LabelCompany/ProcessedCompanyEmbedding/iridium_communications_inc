satellite llc is a publicly traded american company headquartered in mclean virginia iridium operates the iridium satellite constellation a system of  active satellites used for worldwide voice and data communication from handheld satellite phones and other transceiver units the iridium network is unique in that it covers the whole earth including poles oceans and airways with  satellites launched so far the satellites are frequently visible in the night sky as satellite flares a phenomenon typically observed as shortlived bright flashes of light iridium manages several operations

historyedit the iridium communications service was launched on november   by what was then iridium ssc the first iridium call was made by vice president of the united states al gore to his wife tipper gore motorola provided the technology and major financial backing the logo of the company was designed by landor associates and represents the big dipper the founding company went into chapter  bankruptcy nine months later on august   the handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars the cost of service was prohibitive for many users reception indoors was difficult and the bulkiness and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users mismanagement is another major factor cited in the original programs failure in  cnn writer david rohde detailed how he applied for iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative he encountered programming problems on iridiums website and a runaround from the companys representatives after iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers the initial commercial failure of iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was restarted in  by the newly founded iridium satellite llc which was owned by a group of private investors although the satellites and other assets and technology behind iridium were estimated to have cost around us billion the investors bought the firm for about us million in  as part of a rebranding campaign by media graphics inc the logo would be redesigned with updates to corporate color palette and font treatment on february   iridium  collided with a defunct russian satellite kosmos   kilometres  mi over siberia two large debris clouds were created present statusedit iridium satellite llc merged with a special purpose acquisition company ghq created by the investment bank greenhill  co nyse ghl in september  to create iridium communications inc the public company trades on nasdaq under the symbol irdm the company had  subscribers as of the end of december  compared to  subscribers as of the end of december  revenue for the full year  was us  million with operational ebitda of us  million the system is being used extensively by the us department of defense through the dod gateway in hawaii the service revenue to governments made up  of iridiums revenues in  an investigation was begun into the dod contract after a protest by globalstar to the us general accounting office that no tender was provided a hold against the contract was lifted at the request of the department of defense which cited national security reasons this allows the continued use of the network during the investigation the commercial gateway in tempe arizona provides voice data and paging services for commercial customers on a global basis typical customers include maritime aviation government the petroleum industry scientists and frequent world travelers iridium satellites are now an essential component of communications with remote science camps especially the amundsen–scott south pole station in december  an array of twelve iridium modems was put online providing continuous data services to the station for the first time total bandwidth is  kbits matt desch is the ceo of iridium llc hosted payload allianceedit iridium is a founding member of the hosted payload alliance hpa a satellite industry alliance formed to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites membership in the hpa is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties iridium satellite constellationedit main article iridium satellite constellation the iridium system requires  active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept inorbit to serve in case of failure the satellites are in six polar low earth orbital planes at a height of approximately  miles  km satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations most of these satellites were launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy since the bankruptcy until january  only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of  satellites called iridium next is being rolled out planned for launch between  and  on spacex falcon  launch vehicles from vandenberg afb space launch complex  in california on january th  spacex successfully launched  of the new iridium satellites into orbit the second launch of iridium next satellites took place on june th  on a spacex falcon  rocket out of vandenberg air force base this was the second of eight scheduled launches subscriber equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite handset with integrated speakerphone and handsfree capability launched in late  usb data interface with a usbtors bridge chip iridium a — large brick shaped satellite handset manufactured from  to  by the second corporate incarnation of iridium externally almost identical to the original motorola  native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter motorola  — large brick shaped handset manufactured from  to  by the first corporate incarnation of iridium native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter kyocera ssk — manufactured in very small numbers by kyocera in  for the first iridium corporation very large handset can occasionally be found for sale on ebay the motorola  phone with the antenna not extended the kyocera kig gsm phone docked into the sd iridium adapter iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls through space in addition to communicating with the satellite phones in its footprint each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites and routes data between them to effectively create a large mesh network there are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them the spacebased backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space to one of the earth station downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station as satellites leave the area of an earth station the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station communication between satellites and earth stations is at  and  ghz gateways are located in tempe arizona usa wahiawa hawaii usa  — owned by defense information systems agency disa  izhevsk russia the prebankruptcy corporate incarnation of iridium built eleven gateways most of which have since been closed gateways were also built in pune india beijing peoples republic of china moscow russia nagano japan seoul south korea taipei taiwan jeddah saudi arabia and rio de janeiro brazil the company is seeking to reactivate gateways in several countries to comply with national laws in those countries other technical informationedit like other satellite networks iridium terminals need open lineofsight to open sky in order to function for instance units will not work consistently indoors or under forest cover iridium does have a very powerful paging channel that can ring the phone indoors but the customer may have to walk outdoors to take the call there is a webemail to sms gateway which enables messages to be sent from the internet or an email account to iridium handsets for free there is also a voice mail service iridium generally does not have roaming agreements with terrestrialcellular operators telstra in australia allows postpay gsm subscribers to use their sim card however global roaming has to be activated and both incoming and outgoing calls are charged to this account and the call rate is around us per minute the incoming calls are via the gsm phone number of the account with country code etc prefixed in order to use the network it is necessary to have not only appropriate equipment such as a handset or the optional cellular cassette for the motorola  phone but also a payasyougo or contract iridium sim card tracking transceiver unitsedit without an extra global navigation satellite system receiver tracking is difficult but not impossible as the position of a mobile unit can be determined using a doppler shift calculation from the satellite these readings however can be inaccurate with errors in the tens of kilometers even without using doppler shifts a rough indication of a units position can be found by checking the location of the spotbeam being used and the mobile units timing advance the position readings can be extracted from some transceiver units and the a handset using the msgeo at command in the past iridium has used this method of tracking to block service to us embargoed countries such as north korea and other politically unpopular regions such as northern sri lanka it is also used to stop geographically bounded plans from being used outside the designated area the iridium extreme phone introduced in  has a gps location service embedded in the device which the user can use to locate themselves or include in sms messages it can also be used to provide advanced services like geofencing a red emergency button on the top of the unit can be pressed to send the units position to emergency rescue agencies or other number preprogrammed by the user or

iridium call was made by vice president of the united states al gore to his wife tipper gore motorola provided the technology and major financial backing the logo of the company was designed by landor associates and represents the big dipper the founding company went into chapter  bankruptcy nine months later on august   the handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars the cost of service was prohibitive for many users reception indoors was difficult and the bulkiness and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users mismanagement is another major factor cited in the original programs failure in  cnn writer david rohde detailed how he applied for iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative he encountered programming problems on iridiums website and a runaround from the companys representatives after iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers the initial commercial failure of iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was restarted in  by the newly founded iridium satellite llc which was owned by a group of private investors although the satellites and other assets and technology behind iridium were estimated to have cost around us billion the investors bought the firm for about us million in  as part of a rebranding campaign by media graphics inc the logo would be redesigned with updates to corporate color palette and font treatment on february   iridium  collided with a defunct russian satellite kosmos   kilometres  mi over siberia two large debris clouds were created

the public company trades on nasdaq under the symbol irdm the company had  subscribers as of the end of december  compared to  subscribers as of the end of december  revenue for the full year  was us  million with operational ebitda of us  million the system is being used extensively by the us department of defense through the dod gateway in hawaii the service revenue to governments made up  of iridiums revenues in  an investigation was begun into the dod contract after a protest by globalstar to the us general accounting office that no tender was provided a hold against the contract was lifted at the request of the department of defense which cited national security reasons this allows the continued use of the network during the investigation the commercial gateway in tempe arizona provides voice data and paging services for commercial customers on a global basis typical customers include maritime aviation government the petroleum industry scientists and frequent world travelers iridium satellites are now an essential component of communications with remote science camps especially the amundsen–scott south pole station in december  an array of twelve iridium modems was put online providing continuous data services to the station for the first time total bandwidth is  kbits matt desch is the ceo of iridium llc hosted payload allianceedit iridium is a founding member of the hosted payload alliance hpa a satellite industry alliance formed to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites membership in the hpa is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties iridium satellite constellationedit main article iridium satellite constellation the iridium system requires  active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept inorbit to serve in case of failure the satellites are in six polar low earth orbital planes at a height of approximately  miles  km satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations most of these satellites were launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy since the bankruptcy until january  only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of  satellites called iridium next is being rolled out planned for launch between  and  on spacex falcon  launch vehicles from vandenberg afb space launch complex  in california on january th  spacex successfully launched  of the new iridium satellites into orbit the second launch of iridium next satellites took place on june th  on a spacex falcon  rocket out of vandenberg air force base this was the second of eight scheduled launches subscriber equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite

manufactured from  to  by the first corporate incarnation of iridium native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter kyocera ssk — manufactured in very small numbers by kyocera in  for the first iridium corporation very large handset can occasionally be found for sale on ebay the motorola  phone with the antenna not extended the kyocera kig gsm phone docked into the sd iridium adapter iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls through space in addition to communicating with the satellite phones in its footprint each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites and routes data between them to effectively create a large mesh network there are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them the spacebased backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space to one of the earth station downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station as satellites leave the area of an earth station the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station communication between satellites and earth stations is at  and  ghz gateways are located in tempe arizona usa wahiawa hawaii usa  — owned by defense information systems agency disa  izhevsk russia the prebankruptcy corporate incarnation of iridium built eleven gateways most of which have since been closed gateways were also built in pune india beijing peoples republic of china moscow russia nagano japan seoul south korea taipei taiwan jeddah saudi arabia and rio de janeiro brazil the company is seeking to reactivate gateways in several countries to comply with national laws in those countries other technical informationedit like other satellite networks iridium terminals need open lineofsight to open sky in order to function for instance units will not work consistently indoors or under forest cover iridium does have a very powerful paging channel that can ring the phone indoors but the customer may have to walk outdoors to take the call there is a webemail to sms gateway which enables messages to be sent from the internet or an email account to iridium handsets for free there is also a voice mail service iridium generally does not have roaming agreements with terrestrialcellular operators telstra in australia allows postpay gsm subscribers to use their sim card however global roaming has to be activated and both incoming and outgoing calls are charged to this account and the call rate is around us per minute the incoming calls are via the gsm phone number of the account with country code etc prefixed in order to use the network it is necessary to have not only appropriate equipment such as a handset or the optional cellular cassette for the motorola  phone but also a payasyougo or contract iridium sim card tracking transceiver unitsedit without an extra global navigation satellite system receiver tracking is difficult but not impossible as the position of a mobile unit can be determined using a doppler shift calculation from the satellite these readings however can be inaccurate with errors in the tens of kilometers even without using doppler shifts a rough indication of a units position can be found by checking the location of the spotbeam being used and the mobile units timing advance the position readings can be extracted from some transceiver units and the a handset using the msgeo at command in the past iridium has used this method of tracking to block service to us embargoed countries such as north korea and other politically unpopular regions such as northern sri lanka it is also used to stop geographically bounded plans from being used outside the designated area the iridium extreme phone introduced in  has a gps location service embedded in the device which the user can use to locate themselves or include in sms messages it can also be used to provide advanced services like geofencing a red emergency button on the top of the unit can be pressed to send the units position to emergency rescue agencies or other number

commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was restarted in  by the newly founded iridium satellite llc which was owned by a group of private investors although the satellites and other assets and technology behind iridium were estimated to have cost around us billion the investors bought the firm for about us million in  as part of a rebranding campaign by media graphics inc the logo would be redesigned with updates to corporate color

ebitda of us  million the system is being used extensively by the us department of defense through the dod gateway in hawaii the service revenue to governments made up  of iridiums revenues in  an investigation was begun into the dod contract after a protest by globalstar to the us general accounting office that no tender was provided a hold against the contract was lifted at the request of the department of defense which cited national security reasons this allows the continued use of the network during the investigation the commercial gateway in tempe arizona provides voice data and paging services for commercial customers on a global basis typical customers include maritime aviation government the petroleum industry scientists and frequent world travelers iridium satellites are now an essential component of communications with remote science camps especially the amundsen–scott south pole station in december  an array of twelve iridium modems was put online providing continuous data services to the station for the first time total bandwidth is  kbits matt desch is the ceo of iridium llc hosted payload allianceedit iridium is a founding member of the hosted payload alliance hpa a satellite industry alliance formed to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites membership in the hpa is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties iridium satellite constellationedit main article iridium satellite constellation the iridium system requires  active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept inorbit to serve in case of failure the satellites are in six polar low earth orbital planes at a height of approximately  miles  km satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations most of these satellites were launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy since the bankruptcy until january  only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of  satellites called iridium next is being rolled out planned for launch between  and  on spacex falcon  launch vehicles from vandenberg afb space launch complex  in california on january th  spacex successfully launched  of the new iridium satellites into orbit the second launch of iridium next satellites took place on june th  on a spacex falcon  rocket out of vandenberg air force base this was the second of eight scheduled launches subscriber equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite handset with integrated

very large handset can occasionally be found for sale on ebay the motorola  phone with the antenna not extended the kyocera kig gsm phone docked into the sd iridium adapter iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls through space in addition to communicating with the satellite phones in its footprint each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites and routes data between them to effectively create a large mesh network there are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them the spacebased backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space to one of the earth station downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station as satellites leave the area of an earth station the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station communication between satellites and earth stations is at  and  ghz gateways are located in tempe arizona usa wahiawa hawaii usa  — owned by defense information systems agency disa  izhevsk russia the prebankruptcy corporate incarnation of iridium built eleven gateways most of which have since been closed gateways were also built in pune india beijing peoples republic of china moscow russia nagano japan seoul south korea taipei taiwan jeddah saudi arabia and rio de janeiro brazil the company is seeking to reactivate gateways in several countries to comply with national laws in those countries other technical informationedit like other satellite networks iridium terminals need open lineofsight to open sky in order to function for instance units will not work consistently indoors or under forest cover iridium does have a very powerful paging channel that can ring the phone indoors but the customer may have to walk outdoors to take the call there is a webemail to sms gateway which enables messages to be sent from the internet or an email account to iridium handsets for free there is also a voice mail service iridium generally does not have roaming agreements with terrestrialcellular operators telstra in australia allows postpay gsm subscribers to use their sim card however global roaming has to be activated and both incoming and outgoing calls are charged to this account and the call rate is around us per minute the incoming calls are via the gsm phone number of the account with country code etc prefixed in order to use the network it is necessary to have not only appropriate equipment such as a handset or the optional cellular cassette for the motorola  phone but also a payasyougo or contract iridium sim card tracking transceiver unitsedit without an extra global navigation satellite system receiver tracking is difficult but not impossible as the position of a mobile unit can be determined using a doppler shift calculation from the satellite these readings however can be inaccurate with errors in the tens of kilometers even without using doppler shifts a rough indication of a units position can be found by checking the location of the spotbeam being used and the mobile units timing advance the position readings can be extracted from some transceiver units and the a handset using the msgeo at command in the past iridium has used this method of tracking to block service to us embargoed countries such as north korea and other politically unpopular regions such as northern sri lanka it is also used to stop geographically bounded plans from being used outside the designated area the iridium extreme phone introduced in  has a gps location service embedded in the device which the user can use to locate themselves or include in sms messages it can also be used to provide advanced services like geofencing a red emergency button on the top of the unit can be pressed to send the units position to emergency rescue agencies or other number

the founding company went into chapter  bankruptcy nine months later on august   the handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars the cost of service was prohibitive for many users reception indoors was difficult and the bulkiness and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users mismanagement is another major factor cited in the original programs failure in  cnn writer david rohde detailed how he applied for iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative he encountered programming problems on iridiums website and a runaround from the companys representatives after iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers the initial commercial failure of iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was

equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite handset with integrated speakerphone and handsfree capability launched in late  usb data interface with a usbtors bridge chip iridium a — large brick shaped satellite handset manufactured from  to  by the second corporate incarnation of iridium externally almost identical to the original motorola  native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter motorola  — large brick shaped handset manufactured from  to  by the first corporate incarnation of iridium native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter kyocera ssk — manufactured in very small numbers by kyocera in  for the first iridium corporation very large handset can occasionally be found for sale on ebay the motorola  phone with the antenna not extended the kyocera kig gsm phone docked into the sd iridium adapter iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls through space in addition to communicating with the satellite phones in its footprint each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites and routes data between them to effectively create a large mesh network there are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them the spacebased backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space to one of the earth station downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station as satellites leave the area of an earth station the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station communication between satellites and earth stations is at  and  ghz gateways are located in tempe arizona usa wahiawa hawaii usa  — owned by defense information systems agency disa  izhevsk russia the prebankruptcy corporate incarnation of iridium built eleven gateways most of which have since been closed gateways were also built in pune india beijing peoples republic of china moscow russia nagano japan seoul south korea taipei taiwan jeddah saudi arabia and rio de janeiro brazil the company is seeking to reactivate gateways in several countries to comply with national laws in those countries other technical informationedit like other satellite networks iridium terminals need open lineofsight to open sky in order to function for instance units will not work consistently indoors or under forest cover iridium does have a very powerful paging channel that can ring the phone indoors but the customer may have to walk outdoors to take the call there is a webemail to sms gateway which enables messages to be sent from the internet or an email account to iridium handsets for free there is also a voice mail service iridium generally does not have roaming agreements with terrestrialcellular operators telstra in australia allows postpay gsm subscribers to use their sim card however global roaming has to be activated and both incoming and outgoing calls are charged to this account and the call rate is around us per minute the incoming calls are via the gsm phone number of the account with country code etc prefixed in order to use the network it is necessary to have not only appropriate equipment such as a handset or the optional cellular cassette for the motorola  phone but also a payasyougo or contract iridium sim card tracking transceiver unitsedit without an extra global navigation satellite system receiver tracking is difficult but not impossible as the position of a mobile unit can be determined using a doppler shift calculation from the satellite these readings however can be inaccurate with errors in the tens of kilometers even without using doppler shifts a rough indication of a units position can be found by checking the location of the spotbeam being used and the mobile units timing advance the position readings can be extracted from some transceiver units and the a handset using the msgeo at command in the past iridium has used this method of tracking to block service to us embargoed countries such as north korea and other politically unpopular regions such as northern sri lanka it is also used to stop geographically bounded plans from being used outside the designated area the iridium extreme phone introduced in  has a gps location service embedded in the device which the user can use to locate themselves or include in sms messages it can also be used to provide advanced services like geofencing a red emergency button on the top of the unit can be pressed to send the units position to emergency rescue agencies or other number

and major financial backing the logo of the company was designed by landor associates and represents the big dipper the founding company went into chapter  bankruptcy nine months later on august   the handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars the cost of service was prohibitive for many users reception indoors was difficult and the bulkiness and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users mismanagement is another major factor cited in the original programs failure in  cnn writer david rohde detailed how he applied for iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative he encountered programming problems on iridiums website and a runaround from the companys representatives after iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers the initial commercial failure of iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was restarted in  by the newly founded iridium satellite llc which was owned by a group of private investors although the satellites and other assets and technology behind iridium were estimated to have cost around us billion the investors bought the firm for about us million in  as part of a rebranding campaign by media graphics inc the logo would be redesigned with updates to corporate color palette and font treatment on february   iridium  collided with a defunct russian satellite

subscribers as of the end of december  revenue for the full year  was us  million with operational ebitda of us  million the system is being used extensively by the us department of defense through the dod gateway in hawaii the service revenue to governments made up  of iridiums revenues in  an investigation was begun into the dod contract after a protest by globalstar to the us general accounting office that no tender was provided a hold against the contract was lifted at the request of the department of defense which cited national security reasons this allows the continued use of the network during the investigation the commercial gateway in tempe arizona provides voice data and paging services for commercial customers on a global basis typical customers include maritime aviation government the petroleum industry scientists and frequent world travelers iridium satellites are now an essential component of communications with remote science camps especially the amundsen–scott south pole station in december  an array of twelve iridium modems was put online providing continuous data services to the station for the first time total bandwidth is  kbits matt desch is the ceo of iridium llc hosted payload allianceedit iridium is a founding member of the hosted payload alliance hpa a satellite industry alliance formed to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites membership in the hpa is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties iridium satellite constellationedit main article iridium satellite constellation the iridium system requires  active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept inorbit to serve in case of failure the satellites are in six polar low earth orbital planes at a height of approximately  miles  km satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations most of these satellites were launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy since the bankruptcy until january  only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of  satellites called iridium next is being rolled out planned for launch between  and  on spacex falcon  launch vehicles from vandenberg afb space launch complex  in california on january th  spacex successfully launched  of the new iridium satellites into orbit the second launch of iridium next satellites took place on june th  on a spacex falcon  rocket out of vandenberg air force base this was the second of eight scheduled launches subscriber equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite handset with integrated speakerphone and handsfree capability launched in late  usb data interface with

native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter motorola  — large brick shaped handset manufactured from  to  by the first corporate incarnation of iridium native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter kyocera ssk — manufactured in very small numbers by kyocera in  for the first iridium corporation very large handset can occasionally be found for sale on ebay the motorola  phone with the antenna not extended the kyocera kig gsm phone docked into the sd iridium adapter iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls through space in addition to communicating with the satellite phones in its footprint each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites and routes data between them to effectively create a large mesh network there are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them the spacebased backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space to one of the earth station downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station as satellites leave the area of an earth station the

satellite networks iridium terminals need open lineofsight to open sky in order to function for instance units will not work consistently indoors or under forest cover iridium does have a very powerful paging channel that can ring the phone indoors but the customer may have to walk outdoors to take the call there is a webemail to sms gateway which enables messages to be sent from the internet or an email account to iridium handsets for free there is also a voice mail service iridium generally does not have roaming agreements with terrestrialcellular operators telstra in australia

handset or the optional cellular cassette for the motorola  phone but also a payasyougo or contract iridium sim card tracking transceiver unitsedit without an extra global navigation satellite system receiver tracking is difficult but not impossible as the position of a mobile unit can be determined using a doppler shift calculation from the satellite these readings however can be inaccurate with errors in the tens of kilometers even without using doppler shifts a rough indication of a units position can be found by checking the location of the spotbeam being used and the mobile units timing advance the position readings can be extracted from some transceiver units and the a handset using the msgeo at command in the past iridium has used this method of tracking to block service to us embargoed countries such as north korea and other politically unpopular regions such as northern sri lanka it is also used to stop geographically bounded plans from being used outside the designated area the iridium extreme phone introduced in  has a gps location service embedded in the device which the user can use to locate themselves or include in sms messages it can also be used to provide advanced services like geofencing a red emergency button on the top of the unit can be pressed to send the units position to emergency rescue agencies or other number preprogrammed by the user or

iridium call was made by vice president of the united states al gore to his wife tipper gore motorola provided the technology and major financial backing the logo of the company was designed by landor associates and represents the big dipper the founding company went into chapter  bankruptcy nine months later on august   the handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars the cost of service was prohibitive for many users reception indoors was difficult and the bulkiness and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users mismanagement is another major factor cited in the original programs failure in  cnn writer david rohde detailed how he applied for iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative he encountered programming problems on iridiums website and a runaround from the companys representatives after iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers the initial commercial failure of iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was restarted in  by the newly founded iridium satellite llc which was owned by a group of private investors although the satellites and other assets and technology behind iridium were estimated to have cost around us billion the investors bought the firm for about us million in  as part of a rebranding campaign by media graphics inc the logo would be redesigned with updates to corporate color palette and font treatment on february   iridium  collided with a defunct russian satellite kosmos   kilometres  mi over siberia two large debris clouds were created

the public company trades on nasdaq under the symbol irdm the company had  subscribers as of the end of december  compared to  subscribers as of the end of december  revenue for the full year  was us  million with operational ebitda of us  million the system is being used extensively by the us department of defense through the dod gateway in hawaii the service revenue to governments made up  of iridiums revenues in  an investigation was begun into the dod contract after a protest by globalstar to the us general accounting office that no tender was provided a hold against the contract was lifted at the request of the department of defense which cited national security reasons this allows the continued use of the network during the investigation the commercial gateway in tempe arizona provides voice data and paging services for commercial customers on a global basis typical customers include maritime aviation government the petroleum industry scientists and frequent world travelers iridium satellites are now an essential component of communications with remote science camps especially the amundsen–scott south pole station in december  an array of twelve iridium modems was put online providing continuous data services to the station for the first time total bandwidth is  kbits matt desch is the ceo of iridium llc hosted payload allianceedit iridium is a founding member of the hosted payload alliance hpa a satellite industry alliance formed to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites membership in the hpa is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties iridium satellite constellationedit main article iridium satellite constellation the iridium system requires  active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept inorbit to serve in case of failure the satellites are in six polar low earth orbital planes at a height of approximately  miles  km satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations most of these satellites were launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy since the bankruptcy until january  only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of  satellites called iridium next is being rolled out planned for launch between  and  on spacex falcon  launch vehicles from vandenberg afb space launch complex  in california on january th  spacex successfully launched  of the new iridium satellites into orbit the second launch of iridium next satellites took place on june th  on a spacex falcon  rocket out of vandenberg air force base this was the second of eight scheduled launches subscriber equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite

iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls

in that it covers the whole earth including poles oceans and airways with  satellites launched so far the satellites are frequently visible in the night sky as satellite flares a phenomenon typically observed as shortlived bright flashes of light iridium manages several operations centers including tempe arizona and leesburg virginia united states the us department of defense through its own

iridium call was made by vice president of the united states al gore to his wife tipper gore motorola provided the technology and major financial backing the logo of the company was designed by landor associates and represents the big dipper the founding company went into chapter  bankruptcy nine months later on august   the handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars the cost of service was prohibitive for many users reception indoors was difficult and the bulkiness and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users mismanagement is another major factor cited in the original programs failure in  cnn writer david rohde detailed how he applied for iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative he encountered programming problems on iridiums website and a runaround from the companys representatives after iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers the initial commercial failure of iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was restarted in  by the newly founded iridium satellite llc which was owned by a group of private investors although the satellites and other assets and technology behind iridium were estimated to have cost around us billion the investors bought the firm for about us million in  as part of a rebranding campaign by media graphics inc the logo would be redesigned with updates to corporate color palette and font treatment on february   iridium  collided with a defunct russian satellite kosmos   kilometres  mi over siberia two large debris clouds were created

the public company trades on nasdaq under the symbol irdm the company had  subscribers as of the end of december  compared to  subscribers as of the end of december  revenue for the full year  was us  million with operational ebitda of us  million the system is being used extensively by the us department of defense through the dod gateway in hawaii the service revenue to governments made up  of iridiums revenues in  an investigation was begun into the dod contract after a protest by globalstar to the us general accounting office that no tender was provided a hold against the contract was lifted at the request of the department of defense which cited national security reasons this allows the continued use of the network during the investigation the commercial gateway in tempe arizona provides voice data and paging services for commercial customers on a global basis typical customers include maritime aviation government the petroleum industry scientists and frequent world travelers iridium satellites are now an essential component of communications with remote science camps especially the amundsen–scott south pole station in december  an array of twelve iridium modems was put online providing continuous data services to the station for the first time total bandwidth is  kbits matt desch is the ceo of iridium llc hosted payload allianceedit iridium is a founding member of the hosted payload alliance hpa a satellite industry alliance formed to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites membership in the hpa is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties iridium satellite constellationedit main article iridium satellite constellation the iridium system requires  active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept inorbit to serve in case of failure the satellites are in six polar low earth orbital planes at a height of approximately  miles  km satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations most of these satellites were launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy since the bankruptcy until january  only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of  satellites called iridium next is being rolled out planned for launch between  and  on spacex falcon  launch vehicles from vandenberg afb space launch complex  in california on january th  spacex successfully launched  of the new iridium satellites into orbit the second launch of iridium next satellites took place on june th  on a spacex falcon  rocket out of vandenberg air force base this was the second of eight scheduled launches subscriber equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite

iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls through space in addition to communicating with the satellite phones in its footprint each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites and routes data between them to effectively create a large mesh network there are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them the spacebased backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space to one of the earth station downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station as satellites leave the area of an earth station the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station communication between satellites and earth stations is at  and  ghz gateways are located in tempe arizona usa wahiawa hawaii usa  — owned by defense information systems agency disa  izhevsk russia the prebankruptcy corporate incarnation of iridium built eleven gateways most of which have since been closed gateways were also built in pune india beijing peoples republic of china moscow russia nagano japan seoul south korea taipei taiwan jeddah saudi arabia and rio de janeiro brazil the company is seeking to reactivate gateways in several countries to comply with national laws in those countries other technical informationedit like other satellite networks iridium terminals need open lineofsight to open sky in order to function for instance units will not work consistently indoors or under forest cover iridium does have a very powerful paging channel that can ring the phone indoors but the customer may have to walk outdoors to take the call there is a webemail to sms gateway which enables messages to be sent from the internet or an email account to iridium handsets for free there is also a voice mail service iridium generally does not have roaming agreements with terrestrialcellular operators telstra in australia allows postpay gsm subscribers to use their sim card however global roaming has to be activated and both incoming and outgoing calls are charged to this account and the call rate is around us per minute the incoming calls are via the gsm phone number of the account with country code etc prefixed in order to use the network it is necessary to have not only appropriate equipment such as a handset or the optional cellular cassette for the motorola  phone but also a payasyougo or contract iridium sim card tracking transceiver unitsedit without an

iridium satellite constellation a system of  active satellites used for worldwide voice and data communication from handheld satellite phones and other transceiver units the iridium network is unique in that it covers the whole earth including poles oceans and airways with  satellites launched so far the satellites are frequently visible in the night sky as satellite flares a phenomenon typically observed as shortlived bright flashes of light iridium manages several operations centers including tempe arizona and leesburg virginia united states the us department of defense through its own

iridium call was made by vice president of the united states al gore to his wife tipper gore motorola provided the technology and major financial backing the logo of the company was designed by landor associates and represents the big dipper the founding company went into chapter  bankruptcy nine months later on august   the handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars the cost of service was prohibitive for many users reception indoors was difficult and the bulkiness and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users mismanagement is another major factor cited in the original programs failure in  cnn writer david rohde detailed how he applied for iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative he encountered programming problems on iridiums website and a runaround from the companys representatives after iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers the initial commercial failure of iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including teledesic other schemes orbcomm ico global communications and globalstar followed iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never constructed at one stage there was a threat that the iridium satellites would have to be deorbited however they remained in orbit and operational their service was restarted in  by the newly founded iridium satellite llc which was owned by a group of private investors although the satellites and other assets and technology behind iridium were estimated to have cost around us billion the investors bought the firm for about us million in  as part of a rebranding campaign by media graphics inc the logo would be redesigned with updates to corporate color palette and font treatment on february   iridium  collided with a defunct russian satellite kosmos   kilometres  mi over siberia two large debris clouds were created present statusedit iridium satellite llc merged with a special purpose acquisition company ghq created by the investment bank greenhill  co nyse ghl in september  to create iridium communications inc the public company trades on nasdaq under the symbol irdm the company had  subscribers as of the end of december  compared to  subscribers as of the end of december  revenue for the full year  was us  million with operational ebitda of us  million the system is being used extensively by the us department of defense through the dod gateway in hawaii the service revenue to governments made up  of iridiums revenues in  an investigation was begun into the dod contract after a protest by globalstar to the us general accounting office that no tender was provided a hold against the contract was lifted at the request of the department of defense which cited national security reasons this allows the continued use of the network during the investigation the commercial gateway in tempe arizona provides voice data and paging services for commercial customers on a global basis typical customers include maritime aviation government the petroleum industry scientists and frequent world travelers iridium satellites are now an essential component of communications with remote science camps especially the amundsen–scott south pole station in december  an array of twelve iridium modems was put online providing continuous data services to the station for the first time total bandwidth is  kbits matt desch is the ceo of iridium llc hosted payload allianceedit iridium is a founding member of the hosted payload alliance hpa a satellite industry alliance formed to increase awareness of the benefits of hosted government payloads on commercial satellites membership in the hpa is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties iridium satellite constellationedit main article iridium satellite constellation the iridium system requires  active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept inorbit to serve in case of failure the satellites are in six polar low earth orbital planes at a height of approximately  miles  km satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations most of these satellites were launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy since the bankruptcy until january  only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of  satellites called iridium next is being rolled out planned for launch between  and  on spacex falcon  launch vehicles from vandenberg afb space launch complex  in california on january th  spacex successfully launched  of the new iridium satellites into orbit the second launch of iridium next satellites took place on june th  on a spacex falcon  rocket out of vandenberg air force base this was the second of eight scheduled launches subscriber equipmentedit handsetsedit the former iridium provided phones from two vendors kyocera and motorola the motorola  phone is a design from the first commercial phase of iridium whereas the  model is the current version of the handset and was released in  until the release of the  in  the a was the sole handset sold by the company  a functionally identical clone of the motorola  with some slightly different components in  a highly durable iridium extreme  phone was introduced with a builtin gps emergency button and interface to advanced locationbased services an accessory was also introduced at the same time called iridium axcesspoint which when connected to a  or extreme phone creates a wifi hotspot for smartphone email sms and web connections kyocera phone models ssk and sdk are no longer in production but still available in the secondhand and surplus market the kig phone is a small  mhz gsm phone that fitted in a cradle model number sdk that included a large antenna and facilitated connection to the iridium network the ssk is a selfcontained phone but features a rather unusual ball antenna all handsets can receive sms but only the  a  extreme and those based on the  can send them iridium extreme  — a jetwater shock and dust resistant ip as well as gps enabled handset operating temperature    °c launched in september  iridium  — a satellite handset with integrated speakerphone and handsfree capability launched in late  usb data interface with a usbtors bridge chip iridium a — large brick shaped satellite handset manufactured from  to  by the second corporate incarnation of iridium externally almost identical to the original motorola  native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter motorola  — large brick shaped handset manufactured from  to  by the first corporate incarnation of iridium native rs data interface with proprietary pinout adapter kyocera ssk — manufactured in very small numbers by kyocera in  for the first iridium corporation very large handset can occasionally be found for sale on ebay the motorola  phone with the antenna not extended the kyocera kig gsm phone docked into the sd iridium adapter iridium  the iridium a transceiver with an antenna and nal research dpl handset iridium  us air force airmen inspecting an iridium phone in antarctica pagersedit two pagers were made for the iridium network — the motorola  and kyocera spk these are oneway devices that could receive messages sent in the form of sms other satellite phonesedit several other iridiumbased telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft the dpl handset made by nal research combined with a  transceiver is used for some of these products this handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the  series phones standalone transceiver unitsedit these can be used for datalogging applications in remote areas now a common practical use for iridiums services some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use iridium satellites to communicate with their base the remote device is programmed to call or send sbd short burst data see below messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data most of these units can be connected to a handset and used as a fixed telephone the following transceivers have been released over the years iridium core  — similar to the b a modular transceiver released in  designed to be an embedded solution iridium b — a transceiver released in late  is smaller than the a and has similar features iridium a — based on the  some variants have built in gps and autonomous reporting functions supports sbd motorola  — last motorola transceiver supports outgoing sms but no sbd motorola  — original transceiver module does not support outgoing sms or sbd designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset sbd modemsedit these devices support only short burst data for mm services and do not use a sim card iridium  — supports only sbd several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem it was an iridium manufactured product designed as an oem module for integration into applications that only use the iridium short burst data service short burst data applications are supported through an rs interface examples of these solutions include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking iridium  — smaller cheaper version of  released in  iridium  — onefourth the volume and half the footprint of  xx mm sim cardedit removable subscriber identity modules sims are used in iridium phones much like those used for gsm prepaid sim cards are usually green while postpaid cards are red the  and  sbd modems dont use a sim card they are identified by the network solely through the imei of the device and the customer account associated with that imei openportedit openport is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels the system is used for crew calling and email services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts iridium’s global service program provides shipboard technical support to iridium openport customers openport voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred not by the connection time of the session servicesedit calls from iridium phones can be made to any landline or wireless device in the world and typically cost between  to  per minute calls made to iridium phones can be very expensive costing several dollars per minute for example google voice charges usd per minute to directly call an iridium phone it is possible to call with charges reversed by first dialing a number in arizona the call is charged to the receiver at the standard rate for satellite to landline calls but the caller only pays for the call to arizona since iridium will not sell prepaid cards or even its subscription call service directly it is hard to obtain the exact price of making a call there are numerous distributors that will activate iridium phones and sell prepaid vouchers and sim cards voice and data callsedit the iridium system deals with minutes which are subdivided into several much smaller units these minutes are the basic rate to landlines and ordinary mobile phones around the world for a minute annual plan the cost of the basic rates fluctuates around us per minute depending on the distributor there are also regional plans that offer slightly cheaper rates than the normal but these minutes can only be used in a specified geographic location such as africa north america canada or alaska calls to landlines worldwide × basic rate calls to other iridium phones or voice mail × sending sms messages × calls to other operators satellite phones –× data calls × iridium and other satellite phones may be identifiable to the listener by the clipping effect of the data compression and the latency time delay due to the electronic equipment used and the distances the signal must travel the voice codec used is called advanced multiband excitation iridium operates at only  to  kbits which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms by comparison amr used in g phones requires a minimum of  kbits g requires  kbits and ilbc requires  kbits latency for data connections averages  ms roundtrip with a mode of  to  ms and a minimum around  ms latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around  to  for mobile originated packets under good conditions despite the bandwidth limitations transparent tcpip is supported iridium claims data rates up to  kilobits per second for their direct internet service which utilizes vbis compression over a ppp dialup connection to iridiums arizona gateway actual data rates remain at  to  bits for any compressed data such as a jpg image or zip file but plain text or html may transfer up to  kbits iridium   and a phones can be connected to computers using an rs connection as can the a transceiver module the  and extreme phones connect to computers with a standard usb cable using an internal usb to serial bridge chip and windows drivers to emulate a serial com port for compatibility with standard ppp clients once the next generation of satellites is in place iridium plans to provide higherspeed service that can reach up to  mbits prepaid serviceedit prepaid sim cards are available from a variety of different outlets and sometimes appear on auction sites such as ebay their values range from  to  minutes the  minute cards have no validity and the  minute vouchers are valid for only a month but the  minute cards stay valid for two years since iridium charges quite a bit for merely accessing their network without making calls it is possible to extend the validity of such an account by a month for around us it is also possible to refill such an account without purchasing a new sim card as of update the  minute card is the most common one which remains valid for one year and can usually be bought for us to  while the  minute card can cost up to us and the  minute card costs around us postpaid serviceedit there is a basic emergency plan for around us to us per month that offers no minutes at all with calls charged at around us per minute and also numerous plans with included minutes for the more expensive plans around us per month the perminute price is slightly below us phone numbersedit iridium controls the virtual country codes  and  part of the  range designated by the itu for the global mobile satellite system each subscriber is given an digit number prefixed by one of these country codes however many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks need to call reverse charge to a usbased number it is also possible to call an iridium phone by using a usbased gateway number at the arizona gateway in this arrangement a person wishing to call an iridium phone dials  billed at the standard rates to call the united states from their location waits for the prompt enters the  or  number of the iridium phone they are attempting to reach and the network then attempts to complete the call if the iridium subscriber answers their phone it will be billed at its standard usage rate ranging from  to  usd per minute or subtracting minutes from a pool of prepaid minutes assigned to the phone since spring  postpaid iridium subscribers have an option to associate their iridium numbers with a direct usbased number the socalled  access service paging serviceedit the oneway paging service is still operational despite the pagers not being in production for many years nowcitation neededwhen messages are delivered to preselected mdas which cover a certain geographic area three of these mdas may be selected on a webbased portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an iridium phone each country has its own mda based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several mdas while separate mdas exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes this service costs around us per month with a limited number of messages allowed or us for an unlimited number of inbound messages pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code  and can also be contacted using email sms and the webbased interface used to send messages to iridium phones short burst dataedit special modems such as the a   and quake q can be used for sending and receiving short data bursts less than  kilobytes at a time this service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over http to a preconfigured address the mobile unit does not include a destination address when sending a sbd message a crude positioning report is also included in each message sent sbd messages take from  to  seconds to send or receive the latest generation of sbd transceiver the iridium  can receive up to  bytes per sbd data message defined by iridium as mobile terminated sbd and can transmit a maximum of  bytes per sbd message defined by iridium as mobile originated sbd a realworld example of the  chipset in use are the yb tracker or the owax embedded linux computer value added servicesedit to check emails can be very expensive to avoid this there is a service called satnotify by leaf consulting which checks emails periodically and send a text message to the satellite phone if there are new messages air safety communicationsedit in july  the federal aviation administration faa issued a ruling that approves the use of iridium for future air navigation system fans data links enabling satellite data links with airtraffic control atc for aircraft flying in the fans environment including areas not served by inmarsat above or below  degrees latitude which includes polar routes technical detailsedit air interfaceedit communication between satellites and handsets is done using a tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between  and  mhz iridium exclusively controls  mhz of this and shares a further  mhz in  iridium agreed to timeshare a portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from  mhz external hockey puck type antennas used with iridium handheld phones data modems and sbd terminals are usually defined as dbi gain  ohm impedance with rhcp right hand circular polarization and  vswr as iridium antennas function in frequencies very close to that of gps a single antenna may be utilized through a passthrough for both iridium and gps reception the type of modulation used is normally deqpsk although debpsk is used on the uplink mobile to satellite for acquisition and synchronization each time slot is  ms long and sits in a  ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma time slots in each direction the tdma frame starts off with a  ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots this technique is known as timedivision multiplexing small guard periods are used between time slots regardless of the modulation method being used communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at  kilobaud channels are spaced at  khz and each channel occupies a bandwidth of  khz this allows space for doppler shifts handoffedit the iridium system uses three different handoff types as a satellite travels over the horizon calls are handed to adjacent spotbeams this occurs approximately every fifty seconds a satellite only stays in view for seven minutes at the equator when the satellite disappears from view an attempt is made to hand the call to another satellite if no other satellite is in view the connection is dropped this may occur when the signal from either satellite is blocked by an obstacle when successful the intersatellite handoff may be noticeable by a quartersecond interruption the satellites are also able to transfer mobile units to different channels and time slots within the same spot beam earth basestationsedit iridium routes phone calls through space in addition to communicating with the satellite phones in its footprint each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites and routes data between them to effectively create a large mesh network there are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them the spacebased backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space to one of the earth station downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station as satellites leave the area of an earth station the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station communication between satellites and earth stations is at  and  ghz gateways are located in tempe arizona usa wahiawa hawaii usa  — owned by defense information systems agency disa  izhevsk russia the prebankruptcy corporate incarnation of iridium built eleven gateways most of which have since been closed gateways were also built in pune india beijing peoples republic of china moscow russia nagano japan seoul south korea taipei taiwan jeddah saudi arabia and rio de janeiro brazil the company is seeking to reactivate gateways in several countries to comply with national laws in those countries other technical informationedit like other satellite networks iridium terminals need open lineofsight to open sky in order to function for instance units will not work consistently indoors or under forest cover iridium does have a very powerful paging channel that can ring the phone indoors but the customer may have to walk outdoors to take the call there is a webemail to sms gateway which enables messages to be sent from the internet or an email account to iridium handsets for free there is also a voice mail service iridium generally does not have roaming agreements with terrestrialcellular operators telstra in australia allows postpay gsm subscribers to use their sim card however global roaming has to be activated and both incoming and outgoing calls are charged to this account and the call rate is around us per minute the incoming calls are via the gsm phone number of the account with country code etc prefixed in order to use the network it is necessary to have not only appropriate equipment such as a handset or the optional cellular cassette for the motorola  phone but also a payasyougo or contract iridium sim card tracking transceiver unitsedit without an extra global navigation satellite system receiver tracking is difficult but not impossible as the position of a mobile unit can be determined using a doppler shift calculation from the satellite these readings however can be inaccurate with errors in the tens of kilometers even without using doppler shifts a rough indication of a units position can be found by checking the location of the spotbeam being used and the mobile units timing advance the position readings can be extracted from some transceiver units and the a handset using the msgeo at command in the past iridium has used this method of tracking to block service to us embargoed countries such as north korea and other politically unpopular regions such as northern sri lanka it is also used to stop geographically bounded plans from being used outside the designated area the iridium extreme phone introduced in  has a gps location service embedded in the device which the user can use to locate themselves or include in sms messages it can also be used to provide advanced services like geofencing a red emergency button on the top of the unit can be pressed to send the units position to emergency rescue agencies or other number

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
