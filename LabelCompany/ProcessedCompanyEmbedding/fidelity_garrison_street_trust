interest rate adjustment features can be used to enhance price stability if a structure fails to function as intended adverse tax or investment consequences may result neither the internal revenue service irs nor any other regulatory authority has ruled definitively on certain legal issues presented by certain structured securities future tax or other regulatory determinations could adversely affect the value liquidity or tax treatment of the income received from these securities or the nature and timing of distributions made by the fund municipal securities are issued to raise money for a variety of public or private purposes including general financing for state and local governments or financing for specific projects or public facilities they may be issued in anticipation of future revenues and may be backed by the full taxing power of a municipality the revenues from a specific project or the credit of a private organization the value of some or all municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities holders a municipal security may be owned directly or through a participation interest put features entitle the holder to sell a security back to the issuer or a third party at any time or at specified intervals in exchange for this benefit a fund may accept a lower interest rate securities with put features are subject to the risk that the put provider is unable to honor the put feature purchase the security put providers often support their ability to buy securities on demand by obtaining letters of credit or other guarantees from other entities demand features standby commitments and tender options are types of put features repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreedupon price the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreedupon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security as protection against the risk that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation the securities are held in a separate account at a bank markedtomarket daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount the value of the security purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security in addition delays or losses could result if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent the fund will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fimm restricted securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to a fund restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  the  act or in a registered public offering where registration is required the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop the holder might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a security to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreedupon price and time the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fimm such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and a funds yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage short sales against the box are short sales of securities that a fund owns or has the right to obtain equivalent in kind or amount to the securities sold short short sales against the box could be used to protect the net asset value per share nav of the fund in anticipation of increased interest rates without sacrificing the current yield of the securities sold short if a fund enters into a short sale against the box it will be required to set aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities and will be required to hold such securities while the short sale is outstanding the fund will incur transaction costs in connection with opening and closing short sales against the box sources of liquidity or credit support issuers may employ various forms of credit and liquidity enhancements including letters of credit guarantees puts and demand features and insurance provided by domestic or foreign entities such as banks and other financial institutions fimm may rely on its evaluation of the credit of the liquidity or credit enhancement provider in determining whether to purchase a security supported by such enhancement in evaluating the credit of a foreign bank or other foreign entities fimm will consider whether adequate public information about the entity is available and whether the entity may be subject to unfavorable political or economic developments currency controls or other government restrictions that might affect its ability to honor its commitment changes in the credit quality of the entity providing the enhancement could affect the value of the security or a funds share price stripped securities are the separate income or principal components of a debt security the risks associated with stripped securities are similar to those of other money market securities although stripped securities may be more volatile us treasury securities that have been stripped by a federal reserve bank are obligations issued by the us treasury privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer deposits a us treasury security or other us government security with a custodian for safekeeping the custodian issues separate receipts for the coupon payments and the principal payment which the dealer then sells because the sec does not consider privately stripped government securities to be us government securities for purposes of rule a a fund must evaluate them as it would nongovernment securities pursuant to regulatory guidelines applicable to money market funds variable and floating rate securities provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the security variable rate securities provide for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate while floating rate securities have interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a designated benchmark rate or the issuers credit quality some variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries whenissued and forward purchase or sale transactions involve a commitment to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement period for that type of security typically no interest accrues to the purchaser until the security is delivered when purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions the purchaser assumes the rights and risks of ownership including the risks of price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security will not be issued as anticipated because payment for the securities is not required until the delivery date these risks are in addition to the risks associated with a funds investments if a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a purchase is outstanding the purchases may result in a form of leverage when a fund has sold a security pursuant to one of these transactions the fund does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security if the other party to a delayeddelivery transaction fails to deliver or pay for the securities a fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or suffer a loss a fund may renegotiate a whenissued or forward transaction and may sell the underlying securities before delivery which may result in capital gains or losses for the fund portfolio transactions all orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of the fund by fimm pursuant to authority contained in the management contract fimm may also be responsible for the placement of portfolio transactions for other investment companies and investment accounts for which it has or its affiliates have investment discretion in selecting brokers or dealers including affiliates of fimm fimm generally considers the execution price the size and type of the transaction the nature and character of the markets for the security to be purchased or sold the execution efficiency settlement capability and financial condition of the firm the execution services rendered on a continuing basis the reasonableness of any commissions and the provision of additional brokerage and research products and services purchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are effected through brokers who charge a commission for their services securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees ordinarily commissions are not charged on overthecounter otc orders because the fund pays a spread which is included in the cost of the security and is the difference between the dealers cost and the cost to the fund when the fund executes an otc order with an electronic communications network an alternative trading system or a nonmarket maker a commission is charged because there is no spread on the trade the fund may execute portfolio transactions with brokers or dealers that provide products and services these products and services may include economic industry or company research reports or investment recommendations subscriptions to financial publications or research data compilations compilations of securities prices earnings dividends and similar data computerized databases quotation equipment and services research or analytical computer software and services products or services that assist in effecting transactions including services of thirdparty computer systems developers directly related to research and brokerage activities and effecting securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto such as clearance and settlement the receipt of these products and services has not reduced fimms normal research activities in providing investment advice to the fund fimms expenses could be increased however if it attempted to generate these additional products and services through its own efforts certain of the products and services fimm receives from brokers or dealers are furnished by brokers or dealers on their own initiative either in connection with a particular transaction or as part of their overall services in addition fimm may request a broker or dealer to provide a specific proprietary or thirdparty product or service while fimm takes into account the products and services provided by a broker or dealer in determining whether commissions are reasonable neither fimm nor the fund incurs an obligation to the broker dealer or third party to pay for any product or service or portion thereof by generating a certain amount of commissions or otherwise brokers or dealers that execute transactions for the fund on an agency basis may receive commissions that are in excess of the amount of commissions that other brokers or dealers might have charged in recognition of the products and services they have provided before causing the fund to pay such higher commissions fimm will make a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the products and services provided viewed in terms of the particular transaction for the fund or fimms overall responsibilities to the fund or other investment companies and investment accounts typically these products and services assist fimm or its affiliates in terms of its overall investment responsibilities to the fund and other investment companies and investment accounts however each product or service received may not benefit the fund fimm is authorized to allocate portfolio transactions in a manner that takes into account assistance received in the distribution of shares of the fund or other fidelity funds and to use the research services of brokerage and other firms that have provided such assistance fimm may place trades with certain brokers with which it is under common control including national financial services llc nfs and fidelity brokerage services japan llc fbsj provided it determines that these affiliates products services and costs are comparable to those of nonaffiliated qualified brokerage firms fimm may also place trades with redibook ecn llc redibook an electronic communication network ecn in which a whollyowned subsidiary of fmr corp has an equity ownership interest if the commissions are fair reasonable and comparable to commissions charged by nonaffiliated qualified brokerage firms for similar services fimm may allocate brokerage transactions to brokers or dealers including affiliates of fimm who have entered into arrangements with fimm under which the brokerdealer allocates a portion of the commissions paid by a fund toward the reduction of that funds expenses the transaction quality must however be comparable to that of other qualified brokerdealers the trustees of the fund periodically review fimms performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by the fund over representative periods of time to determine if they are reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund the fund may pay both commissions and spreads in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions for the fiscal years ended september   and  the fund paid no brokerage commissions during the fiscal year ended september   the fund paid no brokerage commissions to firms for providing research services the trustees of the fund have approved procedures in conformity with rule f under the  act whereby a fund may purchase securities that are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of fmr participates these procedures prohibit the fund from directly or indirectly benefiting an fmr affiliate in connection with such underwritings in addition for underwritings where an fmr affiliate participates as a principal underwriter certain restrictions may apply that could among other things limit the amount of securities that the fund could purchase in the underwritings from time to time the trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the fund of some portion of the brokerage commissions or similar fees paid by the fund on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable the fund seeks to recapture soliciting brokerdealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities but at present no other recapture arrangements are in effect the trustees intend to continue to review whether recapture opportunities are available and are legally permissible and if so to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be advisable for the fund to seek such recapture although the trustees and officers of the fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by fmr or its affiliates investment decisions for the fund are made independently from those of other funds or investment accounts managed by fmr or its affiliates the same security is often held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment objective of more than one fund or investment account when two or more funds are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable for each fund in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as the fund is concerned in other cases however the ability of the fund to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the fund it is the current opinion of the trustees that the desirability of retaining fimm as investment adviser to the fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous transactions valuation the funds nav is the value of a single share the nav of the fund is computed by adding the value of the funds investments cash and other assets subtracting its liabilities and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding portfolio securities and other assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost this technique involves initially valuing an instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its current market value the amortized cost value of an instrument may be higher or lower than the price the fund would receive if it sold the instrument securities of other openend investment companies are valued at their respective navs at such intervals as they deem appropriate the trustees consider the extent to which nav calculated by using market valuations would deviate from the  per share calculated using amortized cost valuation if the trustees believe that a deviation from the funds amortized cost per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders the trustees have agreed to take such corrective action if any as they deem appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent reasonably practicable the dilution or unfair results such corrective action could include selling portfolio instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity withholding dividends redeeming shares in kind establishing nav by using available market quotations and such other measures as the trustees may deem appropriate performance the fund may quote performance in various ways the funds yield and return fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors yield calculations to compute the yield for the fund for a period the net change in value of a hypothetical investment in one share reflects the value of additional shares purchased with dividends from the one original share and dividends declared on both the original share and any additional shares the net change is then divided by the value of the investment at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return this base period return is annualized to obtain a current annualized yield the fund also may calculate an effective yield by compounding the base period return over a oneyear period in addition to the current yield the fund may quote yields in advertising based on any historical sevenday period yields for the fund are calculated on the same basis as other money market funds as required by applicable regulation yield information may be useful in reviewing the funds performance and in providing a basis for comparison with other investment alternatives however the funds yield fluctuates unlike investments that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated period of time when comparing investment alternatives investors should also note the quality and maturity of the portfolio securities of respective investment companies they have chosen to consider investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates the funds yield will tend to be somewhat higher than prevailing market rates and in periods of rising interest rates the funds yield will tend to be somewhat lower also when interest rates are falling the inflow of net new money to the fund from the continuous sale of its shares will likely be invested in instruments producing lower yields than the balance of the funds holdings thereby reducing the funds current yield in periods of rising interest rates the opposite can be expected to occur return calculations returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of the funds return including the effect of reinvesting dividends and capital gain distributions and any change in the funds nav over a stated period a cumulative return reflects actual performance over a stated period of time average annual returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in the fund over a stated period and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had been constant over the period for example a cumulative return of  over ten years would produce an average annual return of  which is the steady annual rate of return that would equal  growth on a compounded basis in ten years while average annual returns are a convenient means of comparing investment alternatives investors should realize that the funds performance is not constant over time but changes from year to year and that average annual returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the actual yeartoyear performance of the fund in addition to average annual returns the fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment over a stated period average annual and cumulative returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount and may be calculated for a single investment a series of investments or a series of redemptions over any time period returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital including capital gains and changes in share price to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to return returns may be quoted on a beforetax or aftertax basis aftertax returns reflect the return of a hypothetical investment after payment of federal andor state taxes using assumed tax rates aftertax returns may assume that taxes are paid at the time of distribution or once a year or are paid in cash or by selling shares that shares are held through the entire period sold on the last day of the period or sold at a future date and distributions are reinvested or paid in cash returns yields and other performance information may be quoted numerically or in a table graph or similar illustration historical fund results the following table shows the funds day yield and returns for the fiscal periods ended september   average annual returns cumulative returns fund sevenday yield one year life of fund one year life of fund money market central       from july   commencement of operations the following table shows the income

living as measured by the consumer price index cpi over the same period the sp  and djia comparisons are provided to show how the funds return compared to the record of a market capitalizationweighted index of common stocks and a narrower set of stocks of major industrial companies respectively over the same period because the fund invests in shortterm debt securities common stocks represent a different type of investment from the fund common stocks generally offer greater growth potential than the fund but generally experience greater price volatility which means greater potential for loss in addition common stocks generally provide lower income than an investment such as the fund the sp  and djia returns are based on the prices of unmanaged groups of stocks and unlike the funds returns do not include the effect of brokerage commissions or other costs of investing during the period from july   commencement of operations to september   a hypothetical  investment in money market

distributions for the period covered their cash value at the time they were reinvested amounted to  if distributions had not been reinvested the amount of distributions earned from the fund over time would have been smaller and cash payments for the period would have amounted to  for dividends the fund did not distribute any capital gains during the period performance comparisons the funds performance may be compared to the performance of other mutual funds in general or to the performance of particular types of mutual funds these comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund rankings prepared by lipper inc lipper an independent service located in summit new jersey that monitors the performance of mutual funds generally lipper rankings are based on return assume reinvestment of distributions do not take sales charges or trading fees into consideration and are prepared without regard to tax consequences lipper may also rank based on yield in addition to the mutual fund rankings the funds performance may be compared to stock bond and money market mutual fund performance indexes prepared by lipper or other organizations when comparing these indexes it is important to remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment for example while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility likewise money market funds may offer greater stability of principal but generally do not offer the higher potential returns available from stock mutual funds from time to time the funds performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and periodicals for example the fund may quote morningstar inc in its advertising materials morningstar inc is a mutual fund rating service that rates mutual funds on the basis of riskadjusted performance rankings that compare the performance of fidelity funds to one another in appropriate categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising the fund may be compared in advertising to certificates of deposit cds or other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects for example the fund may offer greater liquidity or higher potential returns than cds the fund does not guarantee an investors principal or return and fund shares are not fdic insured fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals understand their investment goals and explore various financial

contract with the fund description of the trust trust organization fidelity money market central fund is a fund of fidelity garrison street trust an openend management investment company organized as a massachusetts business trust on april   on april   fidelity garrison street trust changed its name from fidelity advisor series v to fidelity garrison street trust currently there are two funds in the trust fidelity money market central fund and fidelity ultrashort central fund the trustees are permitted to create additional funds in the trust and to create additional classes of the fund the assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income earnings profits and proceeds thereof subject to the rights of creditors are allocated to such fund and constitute the underlying assets of such fund the underlying assets of each fund in the trust shall be charged with the liabilities and expenses attributable to such fund any general expenses of the trust shall be allocated between or among any one or more of the funds shareholder liability the trust is an entity commonly known as a massachusetts business trust under massachusetts law shareholders of such a trust may under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust the declaration of trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts liabilities obligations and expenses of the trust or fund the declaration of trust provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of shares and requires that each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the trustees relating to the trust or to a fund shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or to one or more funds and its or their assets the declaration of trust further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund the declaration of trust provides for indemnification out of each funds property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason the declaration of trust also provides that each fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which a fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations fmr believes that in view of the
