stocks in different industries respond to different sets of fundamental price drivers quotient finds that structural price inefficiencies and investment opportunities are more persistent at the industry level rather than at the market level quotient has developed a proprietary intraindustry process that exploits the various inefficiencies contained in stock pricings using a disciplined riskcontrolled quantitative technique based on a fundamental and bottomup approach the goal is to generate a consistent pattern of excess return by focusing on riskadjusted performance relative to a selected benchmark the excess return is primarily generated from stock selection rather than market industry or style factors our core investment beliefs are  we can separate alpha from beta  alpha is more persistent and exploitable at the industry level rather than broadly across the market  risk control can minimize unwanted exposures  we can target return and risk through most market cycles  a focus on esg integration provides opportunities not broadly recognized in the market microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must
