based on the cfp board’s standard process indentify and prioritize your objectives—gather your data—analyze—propose recommendations to you—take action wealth planning is a broad term that gets used a lot of different ways because we typically work with clients that are accredited investors the type or style of wealth planning that we do at arete typically is more advanced and customized to you some examples of the types of planning that we can do for you are preretirement accumulation planning helping you to establish and maintain a clear roadmap that identifies what your “number” is that you need in order to make “work” an option not an obligation this type of planning focuses on all the various tools to help you build more wealth and manage your cash flow in such a way that you know what you need to save and how you need to invest in order to be financially free – however you define that for yourself postretirement income planning most financial plans traditionally focus on the preretirement stage of life rarely do most plans really address how to create income and from where in what order etc with the aging of our population arete advisors have placed a special emphasis on training and education in the area of helping you establish a true income plan in retirement income tax planning good wealth planning helps you maximize your spendable dollars it doesn’t matter if you have  but can only spend  after taxes or would you rather have  and pay no taxes that’s the essence of good income tax planning in an everchanging tax policy environment arete advisors help you build more taxfree and taxefficient wealth estate tax planning we tell clients that you have to plan for what the law is now no one has a crystal ball and knows what tax policy will be in the future many of our clients have gross estates that will be taxable and therefore the expertise that arete advisors bring to the table in this area is invaluable our advisors actively work with the most sophisticated estate planning strategies available and we have and continue to implement various strategies that have saved our clients million of dollars of potential estate taxes business owner issues business
