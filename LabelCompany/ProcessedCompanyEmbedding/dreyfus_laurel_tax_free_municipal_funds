bonds   »   types of tax free municipal bonds types of tax free municipal bonds author admin  apr posted in tax free municipal bonds no comments taxfree municipal bonds are the largest component of the municipal bond market and there are many types of taxfree municipal bonds according to barron’s the total market for state and local municipal debt obligations is greater than usd  trillion lenders to the municipal market are individual investors mutual funds money market funds insurance companies property  casualty insurers and commercial lenders state and local municipal governments borrow money from time to time selling bonds is usually the fastest way for the borrower to access funds according to finra the financial industry regulatory authority municipal bonds munis are the only type of taxfree bonds municipal available to us investors let’s look at the types of taxfree municipals you’ll find in the market taxfree municipal bond types taxfree municipal bonds are classified in two types according to the money sourced used to pay interest on them general obligation go bonds general obligations are backed by the issuer’s full faith and credit in other words the issuer’s authority to tax residences is the source of funds necessary to pay interest and repay principal in timely fashion revenue rev bonds revenue bonds derive funds for interest and principal repayment through money generated by a certain project for instance a revenue bond intended to fund highway construction might use tolls collected to pay bondholder interest and repay principal muni bonds traditional pay a certain amount of interest to their bondholders each year the amount of interest to be paid bondholders is called the coupon the coupon represents a specific percentage of the bond issue’s face value and the amount each bondholder receives when the bond comes due at maturity some munis are sold at a percentage of face value or at a discount these taxfree municipal bonds don’t pay current interest the bondholder receives accrued interest at maturity you purchase an original interest discount oid taxfree municipal bond from your bank you want to let the money grow so earning taxfree interest in lump sum when the bond matures is a benefit you don’t bear the same reinvestment risk that other bondholders have if they receive two interest payments a year if they don’t spend funds as income if interest from your municipal bond isn’t considered a taxexempt issue the irs considers muni bond interest as ordinary income just like employer wages interest on savings or dividends earned from stocks naturally don’t buy a taxexempt municipal bond in a currently taxsheltered retirement plan use higher coupon taxable bonds instead taxfree status of municipal bonds not all municipal bond issuers enjoy taxfree status some municipal bond interest is considered taxable and bondholders pay taxes on the interest they earn in order to qualify for taxfree status bond issue proceeds must be deployed to benefit the general public in the municipality for instance if the municipal government needs to build a school or hospital these projects benefit the general public if the bond issue proceeds are used to build a new baseball field or support the local government’s underfunded pension plan the issue probably won’t qualify for taxfree municipal bond status municipal bond interest is sometimes exempt from just state andor local taxes if you’re a resident of massachusetts or another state income tax you’ll probably want to invest in a local municipal bond issue to protect your income from local taxes taxfree municipal bonds and capital gains municipal bonds can be bought and sold in the secondary market like other bonds prices of municipal bonds rise and fall with interest rates and investor demand if you purchased a longterm bond five years ago and interest rates are lower today you may be able to sell the bond for more than your cost basis of course you’ll need to reinvest the money at a lower yield in that case if you sell municipal bonds and book a capital gain these gains aren’t taxfree even if the interest on your bonds is taxexempt let’s say you purchase a usd  municipal bond at a discount of usd  interest rates decline and the price of your bond rises to usd  the capital gain of usd  is taxable if you held the bond for at least a year you have a longterm capital gain if you booked a shortterm gain you’ll pay tax at the ordinary income rate if you own municipal bonds and the prices of your bonds have dropped and you have other capital gains to offset you may consider a tax swap although there are many variations of the municipal bond swap you generally sell municipal bonds to book the loss you then repurchase similar but not identical bonds to maintain the municipal bond portfolio consult your financial advisor before performing a municipal bond swap taxfree municipal bonds for income if you’re looking for a lowrisk way to shelter income taxfree municipal bonds might be right for you ask your financial advisors about the taxexempt status of any municipal issue you’re considering as long as the bond proceeds are earmarked for expenditures to benefit the municipality’s general public your coupon interest should be considered exempt from federal income taxes buying a state municipal bond issue can help you save more money if you don’t live in one of the seven states without a current income tax—alaska tennessee florida new hampshire nevada south dakota washington or texas—you might make more money buying a local issue understanding the types of municipal bonds is also important if you’re most comfortable with general obligation issues for example ask your broker banker or financial planner to let you know when these issues are available it’s relatively to buy taxfree municipal bonds open a securities account with a registered municipal bond dealer or other brokerdealer registered and licensed to sell these securities most large banks and brokerdealers are registered to sell municipal bonds before deciding on the purchase of a bond issue ask if your seller is a dealer or agent you might pay more for the bond if the seller doesn’t own the bond in inventory plan to invest at least usd  in a municipal bond issue if you have less to invest in municipals consider municipal bond unit trusts or
