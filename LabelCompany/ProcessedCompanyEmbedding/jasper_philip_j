manufacture use of jasper drum shells  like  what year did gretsch drums start using jasper shells in their drum linesmanufacture  to  what year did gretsch drums stop using jasper drum shells in their drum lines manufacture i am seeing alot of people using that jasper moniker to sell their vintage gretsch drums lately and i thought if there is some sort of timeline of usage i could pick out

that his shells are not all the same they look like their dog just died some shells have the inside grain running verticle some horizontal the kellers are easy no seams on the inside at all the grain is always horizontal just the verticle seam where the veneer meets jasper shells had multiple horizontal seams inside and sometimes outside  back to top  pork pie posted  september    pm pork pie advanced member members  posts the best thing that ever happened to gretsch was being in business with kaman all of the old hoops were retooled as well as the lugs bascially everything was done right kaman also brought a new level of quality the shells i am speaking are all eras from the glory days up until the went into business with kaman i have cut hundreds of gretsch shells and it is always the same i have to check each drum for thickness before i go to the router keller shells are thinner  back to top  ko posted  september    pm ko dfo drum lord members  posts locationillinois i have heard that the original purpose of the jasper wooden tubes was as concrete forms ive never been able to verify that but it would be thought provoking if true and i have seven gretsch sets  back to top  pork pie posted  september    pm pork pie advanced member members  posts i dont know about the concrete forms i tend to think not only because they are all made at  undersize to me that means they are made as drumshell forms you never know just so i dont come off as an ass not every gretsch kit i have worked on is made of mixed shells just that i have seen a good amount in my  years if a guy loves the kit it does not matter what the shells are made of if a kit sounds great it sounds great  back to top  ko posted  september    am ko dfo drum lord members  posts locationillinois really an all maple keller is closer to what gretsch was advertising when they did mention shell material  ply maple shell there was never any mention of gum wood in the catalogs or ads it seems that the gum is important though being part of the jasper formula i dont think that gretsch simply bought dedicated concrete forms and then made drums out of themjust that maybe jasper originally made similar wooden tubes for that usage and gretsch who were already buying wooden guitar parts from jasper had them make the appropriate diameters or perhaps slightly over the appropriate diameters since heads dont always fit so well for drum shells  back to top  pork pie posted  september    am pork pie advanced member members  posts back in the day nobody cared what a shell was made of that was never part of

i have seen gretsch shells that didnt have any real difference in color between the plies but i never thought much of it curious about the actual differences in thickness i just grabbed a micrometer and ran down to the basement at this very moment i have a gretsch ply ssb  bass shell thats  thick and a  ssb tom thats barely  some other random measurements were ply bass  ply snare  ssb  bass

 emmy andujar didn’t take any classes this summer but the versatile manhattan college forward’s summer has been a learning experience nonetheless the rice graduate and bronx product has spent much of june and july playing with the puerto rican national team by far its youngest player andujar said his veteran teammates taught him a lot particularly the mental side of the game “the older guys on the team they’ve been through everything they’ve been out of college six or seven years” the rising junior told the rumble’s zach braziller “they already know what it takes it felt good because at manhattan i have to lead always coming on this team i was the underdog the rookie they had to lead me it had to be the one to listen instead of talking emmy andujar “it’s going to help me become more of a leader on and off the court knowing what to tell my guys before and after games just being that glue guy for my team” andujar whose mother is from puerto rico played with the andunder team in high school and was invited to tryout in june he made the team and went to china with the squad for three weeks for the  stankovic cup which included scores of professional standouts overseas and former nba players puerto rico finished fourth out of six teams going  as part of the trip to china the team visited group homes met with children and went sightseeing they were also mobbed asked for autographs and to pose for pictures when wearing their puerto rico shirts “it’s crazy how packed the street is and how everyone noticed us and showed us a lot of love” andujar said andujar said he thinks the experience will pay off using the lessons he learned and bringing them with him to riverdale this season he hopes to help the jaspers to a maac crown this winter — they reached the conference championship game last march — and down the road would like to play for puerto rico again possibly even at the  olympics in brazil “i’ll stay in contact with them” he said “hopefully i can get the opportunity again it’s a pride thing to represent my country”  end quote  jr i dispute the reported about classes not every lesson in life cones from yack in the box and puerto rico  my

httpthegospelcoalitionorgblogstrevinwaxquestionsaprochoicecandidateisneveraskedbythemedia  questions a prochoice candidate is never asked by the media debate moderators and reporters love to ask prolife candidates hard questions about abortion curiously they don’t do the same for prochoice candidates  begin quote  here are  questions you never hear a prochoice candidate asked by the media  you say you support a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices in regards to abortion and contraception are there any restrictions you would approve of  in  the economist featured a cover story on “the war on girls” and the growth of “gendercide” in the world – abortion based solely on the sex of the baby does this phenomenon pose a problem for you or do you believe in the absolute right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy because the unborn fetus is female  in many states a teenager can have an abortion without her parents’ consent or knowledge but cannot get an aspirin from the school nurse without parental authorization do you support any restrictions or parental notification regarding abortion access for minors  end quote  first three question are great seems like we could split the prochoice front                      subscribe              distributejasperjottingssubscribeyahoogroupscom unsubscribe          distributejasperjottingsunsubscribeyahoogroupscom
