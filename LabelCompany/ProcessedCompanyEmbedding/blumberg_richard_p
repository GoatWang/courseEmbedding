richard a cole psdavidwhitejr ratedi was referred to richard colei was referred to richard cole through legal voice as a lawyer who was willing to do one day only representation i also highly recommend legal voice as the best nonprofit organization for getting legal advice and referrals to attorneys for free after leaving a voice message for richard on a friday he said he had an opening and could be my legal representative for my  am court hearing on monday although it was easter weekend and he was spending time with his family he contacted me over a dozen times per email to get details about the court hearing we met before the court hearing and richard was very focused on getting the details from me he needed to achieve a successful outcome he has the experience to get straight to the point during the court hearing i noticed he had a stack of legal printouts with yellow sticky notes which demonstrated to me he had really invested time into preparing for a one day only representation and was not out to just earn a flat fee without working for it richard cole is a rare excellent experienced lawyer who cares and works hard for his clients i was so impressed by his work ethic i then hired him to represent me on additional legal issues and each time i asked for his help he provided service that knocked my socks off richard has stopped me from making mistakes in my court cases and in my decisions i personally do not want a lawyer who does not have the strength of character to tell me when i am doing something that will not produce positive outcomes richard gives practical advice he emphasizes staying focused and professional in approaching a problem i hope this review has been helpful and one day richard cole can help you also i was encouraged by legal voice to not thank them but to thank the lawyer they referred me tobienstock law llcz o ratedthe best divorce attorney in seattlebefore i found ms kristen i had consulted with  other attorneys i initially consulted with her on the phone and  minutes into the conversation i knew she was the one through ms kristen i have filed for dissolution temporary orders and a domestic violence protection order its a very complex divorce case she had the most knowledge out of all of the attorneys i had spoken with she knew about jurisdiction and emergency jurisdiction laws not just for the state of washington but out of state as well she has much experience in relocation with children she is fierce strong and fights for me like i am her family she has given me many options and scenarios so i never feel overwhelmed and know what is comingexpected whenever things dont go as planned she comes up with something to remedy it she makes me feel comfortable and is always available email phone  even text she listens is caring and works very hard my husband holds an esteemed position in the community and she is never intimated about going up against him she has many years of experience and i would not trust anyone else with my family law issues from this point on i highly recommend her she is worth every pennylaw office of eric j schurmanfreeandhappy ratedi obviously didnt meet eric si obviously didnt meet eric schurman during the best of times but i cant recommend him enough for making a painful period a lot easier to get through i found him through his positive reviews online and now i’m glad to be able to add my voice to the growing chorus of praise he handled my case with professionalism and compassion understanding how difficult this time was for me his knowledge of the law and of my rights gave me confidence and put me at ease throughout the process his response time to phone calls and emails is amazingly swift which made me feel less like ‘just another client’ and more like i was being taken care of eric displayed a thorough command of the law and a gift for delivering measured wise counsel at every step his eventempered and compassionate demeanor was also reassuring—and even better he won our case i am so thankful i had him on my side i would recommend eric to my closest friends knowing they would be in good handscharles h williams attorney and counselor at law psjeffrey z ratedcharles williams is an excellent attorney i hired him because i knew he had a great reputation and the fact that he was also named attorney of the year by his peers didnt hurt either he assisted my son in a serious matter that not only could have prevented him from attending college but also would have had longterm ramifications for years to come charles was able to find a resolution that was fair and reasonable and gave my son the opportunity to attend college and to move forward as a young adult without a black mark on his name not only did the judge comment on the fast resolution in the case but the prosecutor went out of his way to tell me that i had hired an excellent attorney equally important in my view was the wisdom he shared with my son about choices in life  how to make the right ones and how to avoid the wrong ones he has taken that to heart and thanks to charles is heading in the right direction with a bright future ahead of himlaw offices of kevin tromboldruslan ratedmost outstanding and trustwortmost outstanding and trustworthy lawyerkevin has taken care of many of my criminal cases starting from a negligent driving to wreckless to dwi i worked with other lawyers actually  to be exact and no one even comes close to kevins expertise he worked and works very hard in order to get a ticket dismissed or reduced the least to say he has been a very thorough and very knowledgeable attorney he has dismissed andor reduced all of the the cases in which i hired him to represent me he is the best the only attorney i would hire to represent me in any criminal court he has done a superb job and i am very happy to have such an understandable at the same time aggressive lawyer that will do everything in his power to help you goldberg  jonesdanroberts ratedwhen i first came to goldberg when i first came to goldberg jones i was looking for a custody attorney who would represent me without being too aggressive and expensive i had already interviewed several attorneys and was rapidly getting discouraged in my search thats when i met scott marlow his affable yet straight forward approach to my situation put me at ease which gave me the reassurance that he would represent my interests without any drama andor courtroom theatrics scott always presented me with several options that were thoroughly researched and often took the conservative approach thanks to scotts outstanding knowledge of family law and personable character i now have full custody of my two children thank you scottlaw office of eric j schurmanjdman ratedtheir is not enough good things in the world to describe this fantastic lawyer i was very impressed with his knowledge of the law and his take charge approach i was looking at many years in jail and eric sent me home a free man with little jail time i am totally mind blown by what this guy has done for me and my family this is not a slime ball lawyer just tell him the truth and he will be honest with you yea its going to cost you but its worth every penny if you got a brain in your head and your back against the wall i am telling you this is the go to guythank you a million times eric brown stuartbshowers ratedstuart brown sets aside the ststuart brown sets aside the stereo types you think of when you hear the title lawyer stuart has redefined that titled for me and my family the day my wife and i walked into his office  years ago he took the time to meet with us did not rush us out of his office as if we were just another paycheck ticket for him we spent  years in custody court fighting for my daughter with stuarts dedication to my family and i we were able to remove my daughter from a dangerous situation and bring her home my family and i will forever be in debt to stuart brown and his staff lynn pollocknk ratedafter working with lynn this past year i told several friends about her wonderful service and support they were surprised because they had read some bad reviews about lynn and her firm i now see what they were referring to and i must say i am very disappointed that more of her clients havent responded to this negative bashing of a fine attorney lynn was recommended to me by several highprofile lawyers in king county and my experience with both lynn and her assistant robin was not only helpful but reassuringi would recommend her in a heart beatgoldberg  jonesbazillionairemooney ratednatalie rasmussen years ago i retained natalie rasmussen for my child support modification case i tried to represent myself  previous times and was unsuccessful it was a very stressful time for me and my family natalie helped me through the case and was honest she always let me know which way it could go good or bad in the end she won the case

and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle the more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with
