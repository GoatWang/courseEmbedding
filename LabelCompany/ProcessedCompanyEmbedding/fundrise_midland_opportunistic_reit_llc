another crowd another crowd crowdfunding and eis intelligence for uk investors you are here news briefing  crowdfunding sme and alternative finance submitted by another crowd on mon   pm the essentials are here and will be regularly updated if you want to be wellinformed about the investment crowdfunding scene and youre short of time this is the place to visit please register  its free  to read our daily digest of whats happening in our world  todays briefing  uk – real estate   cityam reports on the impact of alternative financing including pp crowdfunding on the property market   “uk banks have halved their lending to property developers over the past two years in an effort to derisk their balance sheets according to new data from peertopeer property funding platform saving stream bank loans to property developers fell from £bn in april  to £bn in april  meanwhile alternative financing options have entered the mainstream as property developers seek new sources of capital since the  financial crash banks have been under increasing pressure to derisk their balance sheets and reduce their debt exposure in order to meet new capital holding requirements according to saving stream lending against property development is still viewed as a ‘speculative’ investment by many riskaverse banks by contrast large debt funds are able to step in with financing offers for big property developments while peertopeer lenders can offer favourable terms for small and medium sized developments furthermore peertopeer investors are able to benefit from higher investment returns which are no longer available through banks”    uk – fintech   the migrant reports   “at the core of the current boom in fintech lies to desire to do things better than the traditional financial institutions by leveraging technology to drive down costs and improve the usability of financial products and services this has been highly beneficial to consumers including the migrant community in the uk in the uk there are now many new financial services provided by fintech companies which are either specifically targeted at migrants such as monese and worldremit or are advantageous for migrants in general”   the full article is available here      uk – equity   “less than a week after successfully securing its initial funding goal on seedrs london restaurant pronto is quickly nearing £ pronto provides healthy meals delivered hot with a minute free delivery the restaurant revealed that it is looking to create delicious affordable quality meals that are healthy enough to eat every day and available at the touch of a button” reports crowdfundinsider      uk – eisseis   the platform iexpats aimed at expat brits examines eisseis tax break investments   “british investors are increasingly looking for the chance to invest in overseas companies while collecting generous tax breaks lots of overseas companies have realised that the rules of british tax incentivised investment schemes apply to them as well as british startups and growing businesses the two tax breaks that cover this are the seed enterprise investment scheme seis and the enterprise investment scheme eis both offer similar breaks – but have different investment caps and rates of relief ·       seis gives a  tax income tax refund up to a limit of £ a tax year ·       eis gives the refund at  up to £ million other tax breaks exempt investment growth from cgt and deal with loss relief if a company fails”   the full article is available here      us – crowdfunding   crowdfundinsider reports on the alternative finance equivalent of a convertible debt to equity bond   “earlier this month crowdfund insider contributor robin sosnow wrote about “simple agreements for future equity”safes and how they were quickly becoming the investment vehicle of choice for reg cf crowdfunding portals in brief safes are similar to convertible debt except founders are not faced with a ticking time bomb of a maturity date when they must pay back or refinance the debt  investors still receive the option to convert into equity at a future date and thus defer the challenges of establishing a valuation  sosnow an attorney pointed to the fact that  out of the  reg cf issuers at that time were using safes  now republic an offshoot of angellist is jumping on board with their very own version of safes according to a note forwarded by ken ngyuyen cofounder of republic existing security instruments are poorly suited for title iii  reg cf crowdfunded offers issuing companies can be left with many small investors on their cap tables causing additional work for the small company some larger investors may be turned off as well if the cap table is bloated republic’s solution is the “crowd safe” the crowd safe is a derivative of the ycombinator safe”   the full article is available here      us – real estate   crowdfuninsider reports the launch of three new ereits   “fundrise filed three more a’s with the sec indicating its intent to expand its service of providing access to real estate investment to a wider audience under reg a  currently fundrise is offering two different “ereits” to investors the first the income ereit focusses on quarterly dividend income and invests specifically in debt  the second and newer vehicle is the growth ereit that focuses on equity and is naturally more riskier than the prior ereit but expected returns may be higher the three new filings on the sec site appear to be more geographic in focus the three llcs are as follows ·       fundrise west coast opportunistic reit ·       fundrise midland opportunistic reit ·       fundrise east coast opportunistic reit according to the offering circulars west coast will invest in and manage a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of investments in multifamily rental properties and development projects located primarily in the los angeles san francisco san diego seattle wa and portland or midlands will target multifamily rental properties and development projects located primarily in the houston dallas austin chicago and denver the east coast fund will invest in similar properties in the states of massachusetts new york new jersey north carolina south carolina georgia and florida each llc hopes to raise up to  million the maximum amount under reg a with price per share of  and a minimum purchase of  shares  as no properties are yet in any of these portfolio holdings these are blind pool investments in the past fundrise has updated investors on a rolling basis as suitable investments are added to each ereit”   the full article is available here      us – fintech   institutional investor runs a blog proclaiming that bankers are all set to embrace fintech on the principle that it can’t be beaten so should be joined…      international – fintech   caitlin klevorick surveys the fintech scene in techcrunch   “here’s what we know these signals are actually the chaotic realities of a space that is maturing yes government regulation is on its way but that doesn’t mean the sky is falling compliance and transparency within markets are good things consumer protections are good things so while many have focused on the role that regulations may play in the industry — with clear fears that government may stifle innovation in the face of this turmoil — the truth is much more complicated at heart the competitive advantages in fintech are the same as the rest of the startup world with the same power and purpose of “disruption” — better technology faster iteration and more empathy for users regulatory arbitrage if it ever truly existed within finance is not a defensible business strategy product quality customer outreach and lower cost structures are clear more specific regulations are forthcoming but to think it will be the downfall of the industry is naïve”   the full article is available here      international – fintech   a reprise of a recent report in singapore’s business times   “the singapore fintech consortium and the fintech center of korea have signed a memorandum of understanding mou to work more closely in support of emerging technology in the financial sector the singapore group posted a brief statement on the arrangement we are pleased to sign an mou with fintech center of korea under which the two institutions will provide proper aid to fintech companies from the partner country the formal signing took place at the echelon asia summit this week in singapore speaking to the business times gerben visser cofounder and managing partner of the singapore fintech consortium stated “it’s very encouraging to see cohesion between the various players in the south korean fintech ecosystem comprising the government regulators entrepreneurs and the private sector”    international – pp   livemint examines the regulatory framework of india’s nascent pp industry   “the consultation paper on peertopeer pp lending released by the reserve bank of india rbi in late april proposes a balanced approach to help pp players flourish as well as safeguard them from various risks of business fallouts the concept which started with only individuals as participants now includes micro small and mediumsized businesses proprietors and retailers through partnerships with leading banks pp lending is now moving towards offline channels according to morgan stanley research pp lending is estimated to increase to  billion globally growing at an expected compound annual growth rate of  rbi has proposed six key areas to
