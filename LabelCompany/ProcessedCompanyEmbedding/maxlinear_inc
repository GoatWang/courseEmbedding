apart from the competition fullspectrum capture the fastest way to the internet in  cable and satellite providers were searching for a technology to boost the bandwidth and increase the number of video channels they could deliver to our homes the technology needed for scaling up bandwidth to gigabit per second levels without  paying a prohibitive penalty in size and power dissipation just did not exist yet as our engineering team took on this challenge project hercules was born the core technology behind project hercules is called fullspectrum capture fullspectrum capture digitizes filters processes and then outputs a highresolution digital version of the entire cable or satellite signal spectrum as a result when hercules connects to the internet it delivers up to  gbps of digital data all this technology is packed into a single chip that measures only mm x mm several years after the launch of project hercules millions of products based on fullspectrum capture technology are deployed around the world by satellite and cable providers in multichannel video gateways and gigabit speed data services to customers who want to download watch and record content on their tvs computers tablets and smartphones staying true to our lowpower roots our fullspectrum capture products consume ten times less power than traditional receivers need to process the same amount of data
