that helps backstop the fastgrowing use of us exchangetraded funds giving smaller firms an opportunity to grab market share goldman has told fund providers it is scaling back its role as a top lead market maker lmm for etfs and has already slashed the number of funds it supports in that capacity according to disclosures fund managers and other trading firms this month relatively high regulatory and other costs of operating as an lmm prompted the pullback by goldman one of the few large banks remaining in that role some people said a spokeswoman for goldman declined to comment on the banks marketmaking business the move signals the shifting landscape of making markets in many assets away from traditional brokerdealers towards smaller electronicfocused upstarts lmms are critical to keeping etfs trading smoothly while brokersdealers can typically trade as they please firms acting as lmms must consistently offer competitive buyandsell quotes in their assigned etfs and they receive rebates on exchange fees some also provide startup financing for the funds the lmms risk some of their own capital to buy and sell etfs to help maintain their liquidity unlike smaller rivals big banks like goldman sachs are subject to strict capital requirements by regulators putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to costs in an already lowmargin business etfs attracted a record  billion globally in the first half of this year compared to  billion at the same point last year according to research service etfgi llp despite the skyrocketing growth in etfs it can be hard to translate the lmm business into a highmargin operation market making is a technology business as much as a trading enterprise and involves finding the right price for funds holding dozens of stocks or bonds in a split second while making other trades to manage risk one industry veteran described the business as scraping fractions of pennies all day goldman continues to make issuing its own etfs through its asset management unit a priority however even as it steps back from providing the infrastructure to keep such funds trading  bowing out since last year the number of etfs backed by goldman as a lmm on intercontinental exchange incs nyse arca trading venue has plunged to  from  according to documents published by nyse goldman is no longer the lead market maker on major etfs including the  billion ishares msci eafe etf  billion guggenheim sp  equal weight etf and  billion wisdomtree japan hedged equity fund according to nyse data nyse arca is the largest exchange for etfs by number of listings other exchanges offer similar programs to encourage market making bill belden head of etf business development for guggenheim investments said goldman is no longer lead market maker on several of their etfs as of last month as they have largely stepped out of the lmm business goldman continues to be a force in etf trading even as it withdraws from lmm assignments at exchanges it held a  percent market share for us etf trading at the end of the second quarter up about  percent over the same period last year according to exchange traded volume from nyse arca and nasdaq stepping in one of goldmans competitors speaking on condition of anonymity said the bank had a very attractive book of assignments adding that there is high demand for exchangetraded products that goldman is dropping lesserknown but deeply experienced trading firms including new yorkbased jane street group llc and a subsidiary of amsterdambased imc bv have picked up some of goldmans former lmm assignments nyse data shows despite goldmans exit some bankowned trading operations see value in the business such as rbc capital markets part of royal bank of canada which has stepped into new lmm roles douglas yones nyses head of etfs said that while some of its liquidity providers have narrowed their presence it has opened the door for many more firms to enter the marketplace with positive results goldman reported overall trading revenue of  billion during the second quarter a drop of  percent from the year ago period and the worst start to a year since chief executive lloyd blankfein took the helm of the bank the banks oncemassive lmm franchise was partly the inheritance of its  billion acquisition in september  of spear leeds  kellogg lp which served as lead for the first uslisted etf the spdr sp

goldman sachs low cost etfs key for us goldman sachs low cost etfs key for us october   cinthia murphy goldman sachs asset management is the latest big player to enter the etf market for the first time before you think the firm is late to the party know that goldman isn’t vying for a metoo spot its two first etfs are smartbeta funds but they came with unexpectedly low expense ratios in a segment that’s populated by much higher costs the activebeta us large cap equity etf gslc costs only  percent or  per  invested the goldman sachs activebeta emerging markets equity etf gem charges  percent michael crinieri global head of etf strategy for gsam tells us about the firm’s plans etfcom the first thing that struck me about your first etf was its expense ratio smart beta for  bps how are you pulling this off are etfs going to be loss leaders for gsam michael crinieri we aren’t a startup we’re part of a large financial firm this is a highly scalable business and we think we can get to scale very quickly by offering our products at very competitive prices we’ve been implementing these strategies for institutional investors for a number of years we’re now packaging them into the activebeta index and offering an etf on this index we want to offer these strategies to a large group of investors at a competitive price etfcom how is the smartbeta concept—its quasiactive nature if you will—the best fit for goldman’s expertisecrinieri goldman sachs has a lot of experience in the quant space we’ve been involved in quantitative management for  years and manage more than  billion in quant strategies this is a strategy that’s completely rulesbased it’s a multifactor approach we’re looking at value quality momentum and low volatility we package the four factors together in an equalweighted manner this is a product that’ll give clients diversified exposure and smooth out the ride over various market cycles etfcom do you worry about differentiation multifactor etfs are very popular and we’ve had a lot of them come to market how are you different crinieri we think our product will be differentiated based on our structure our differentiated approach and certainly our pricing the activebeta strategy is really a good replacement for a traditional marketcapweighted index the strategy is benchmarkaware in that we start with a marketcapweighted index and we’re making small tilts to overweight or underweight certain securities based on their scoring in each one of those four factors i mentioned etfcom is goldman going after northern trust’s enhanced index assets in other words are you looking to grow assets or are you looking to take market share crinieri we think this is a good alternative for investors who have already bought into passive management and are just looking for the ability to outperform the traditional marketcapweighted indexes that’s the opportunity and we think that’s a very broad opportunity if you think about the number and types of investors that are using traditional index strategies these products will appeal to individual investors as well as large institutions etfcom some say you’re late to the party why make a move into the etf space now crinieri first of all we still think it’s early insofar as the development of the etf market theres  trillion in assets in us etfs alone goldman sachs research on the etf sector concluded that the global etf market could double in size by  there’s significant room for growth but really the reason we’re doing it now is that our customers are asking for it our clients have asked for these strategies in an etf wrapper so we’re responding to demand from our clients we also think the market has evolved from the traditional index products to more strategic products that are more leaning toward active management and that really plays to gsam’s strengths etfcom will goldman remain focused on multifactor approaches are you going to consider active etfs what comes next crinieri we intend to have a broad offering of etfs over time we’re focusing on the activebeta products right now we’ve filed for six of those two are launched already so there are four additional products to come including us smallcap international europe and japan we’ve also filed for five liquid alternative strategies which are hedge fund replication strategies we have a multistrategy hedge fund replicator and then four individual hedge fund strategies that we’ve already filed for and we have a pipeline of other products that we’re working on that have not been filed yet etfcom to clarify you’re marketing your first etfs as “activebeta” how much of these strategies are actively managed crinieri these strategies are designed by our quant team who have a lot of experience in this area but they are  percent rulesbased they’re rebalanced on a quarterly basis so no one’s making investment decisions along the way it’s really an indexbased strategy etfcom can you tell me a little about your first etfs crinieri we launched gslc the goldman sachs activebeta us large cap equity on sept  priced at  bps—very competitive to products in the traditional beta space this strategy works very well over long periods of time but also over different geographies we apply this strategy to the emerging markets in our emerging markets equity gem which we launched on sept  just as we apply it to us stocks with very interesting results this is a great way for investors to think about outperforming the market when it comes to their emerging market allocation at a competitive price we’re obviously going through a period of volatility especially in the emerging markets but what we’re hearing from clients is that they’re looking for new opportunities in the space so it’s an interesting time to be bringing a new alternative to the market etfcom what do you think will be the most difficult thing for goldman to get traction in the etf market crinieri we really think we’re very wellpositioned we have interesting strategies we’re a wellknown asset manager and have a great distribution team that can really help get the word out to our investors we’re pretty excited about the opportunities contact cinthia murphy at email protected   equityusemerging markets   find your next etf asset class all asset classesalternativesasset allocationcommoditiescurrencyequityfixed income

changed her tune on bitcoin and now expects big upside for the cryptocurrency based on updated technical analysis of btc’s chart sheba jafari the head of technical strategy at goldman sachs notes that bitcoin “may need another few swings” before it tests new highs however the analyst says that the inability to break out above btc’s june  high of  means it may be forming a technical triangle pattern a resulting bearish move could take bitcoin down as low as  she writes amid as may as five big downswings as business insider notes the case gets a lot more bullish from there but fear not says jafari
