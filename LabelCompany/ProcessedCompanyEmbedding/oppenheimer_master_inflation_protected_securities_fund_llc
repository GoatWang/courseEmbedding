investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the examples are based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire month period ended january   actual expenses the first section of the table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this section for the class of shares you hold together with the amount you invested to estimate the expense that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled expenses paid during  months ended january   to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second section of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio for each class of shares and an assumed rate of return of  per year for each class before expenses which is not the funds actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other

expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as frontend or contingent deferred sales charges loads therefore the

provide protection against inflation the value of the bonds principal or the interest rate paid on the bond is adjusted to track changes in a stated inflation measure with respect to inflationindexed bonds whose principal is adjusted with inflation if the index measuring inflation falls the principal value of the inflationindexed bonds will be adjusted downward and consequently the interest payable on these securities calculated with respect to smaller principal amounts will be reduced if the index measuring inflation rises both the principal value and the interest payable calculated with respect to a larger principal amount will increase with respect to inflationindexed bonds whose interest rate is adjusted with inflation instead of adjusting the bonds principal amount the inflation adjustment is reflected in the coupon payment because of this inflation adjustment feature inflationprotected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixedrate bonds with similar maturities as of january   securities with an aggregate market value of  representing  of the funds net assets were comprised of inflationindexed debt securities concentration risk focusing on one type of investment inflationindexed bonds rather than a broad spectrum of investments makes the funds share price particularly sensitive to market economic and other events that may affect this investment type the funds investment in inflationindexed bonds may be speculative and subject to greater price volatility than other types of investments      risk exposures and the use of derivative instruments the funds investment objective not only permits the fund to purchase investment securities it also allows the fund to enter into various types of derivatives contracts including but not limited to futures contracts forward currency exchange contracts credit default swaps interest rate swaps total return swaps variance swaps and purchased and written options in doing so the fund will employ strategies in differing combinations to permit it to increase decrease or change the level or types of exposure to market risk factors these instruments may allow the fund to pursue its

overthecounter otc transaction or through a securities or futures exchange and cleared through a clearinghouse market risk factors in accordance with its investment objectives the fund may use derivatives to increase or decrease its exposure to one or more of the following market risk factors commodity risk commodity risk relates to the change in value of commodities or commodity indexes as they relate to increases or decreases in the commodities market commodities are physical assets that have tangible properties examples of these types of assets are crude oil heating oil metals livestock and agricultural products  credit risk credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer to meet interest and principal payments or both as they come due in general lowergrade higheryield bonds are subject to credit risk to a greater extent than loweryield higherquality bonds equity risk equity risk relates to the change in value of equity securities as they relate to increases or decreases in the general market foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk relates to the change in the us dollar value of a security held that is denominated in a foreign currency the us dollar value of a foreign currency denominated security will decrease as the dollar appreciates against the currency while the us dollar value will increase as the dollar depreciates against the currency interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the fluctuations in value of fixedincome securities resulting from the inverse relationship between price and yield for example an increase in general interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of already issued fixedincome investments and a decline in general interest rates will tend to increase their value in addition debt securities with longer maturities which tend to have higher yields are subject to potentially greater fluctuations in value from changes in interest rates than obligations with shorter maturities volatility risk volatility risk refers to the magnitude of the movement but not the direction of the movement in a financial instruments price over a defined time period large increases or decreases in a financial instruments price over a relative time period typically indicate greater volatility risk while small increases or decreases in its price typically indicate lower volatility risk derivatives may have little or no initial cash investment relative to their market value exposure and therefore can produce significant gains or losses in excess of their cost due to unanticipated changes in the market risk factors and the overall market this use of embedded leverage allows the fund to increase its market value exposure relative to its net assets and can substantially increase the volatility of the funds performance in instances where the fund is using derivatives to decrease or hedge exposures to market risk factors for securities held by the fund there are also risks that those derivatives may not perform as expected resulting in losses for the combined or hedged positions some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss regardless of the size of the funds initial investment           oppenheimer master inflation protected securities fund llc        risk exposures and the use of derivative instruments continued     additional associated risks from investing in derivatives also exist and potentially could have significant effects on the valuation of the derivative and the fund typically the associated risks are not the risks that the fund is attempting to increase or decrease exposure to per its investment objectives but are the additional risks from investing in derivatives examples of these associated risks are liquidity risk which is the risk that the fund will not be able to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner and counterparty credit risk which is the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the fund     the funds actual exposures to these market risk factors and associated risks during the period are discussed in further detail by derivative type below futures contracts a futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity financial instrument or currency at a negotiated price on a stipulated future date the fund may buy and sell futures contracts and may also buy or write put or call options on these futures contracts futures contracts and options thereon are generally entered into on a regulated futures exchange and cleared through a clearinghouse associated with the exchange     upon entering into a futures contract the fund is required to deposit either cash or securities initial margin in an amount equal to a certain percentage of the contract value in an account registered in the futures commission merchants name subsequent payments variation margin are paid to or from the futures commission merchant each day equal to the daily changes in the contract value such payments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses should the fund fail to make requested variation margin payments the futures commission merchant can gain access to the initial margin to satisfy the funds payment obligations     futures contracts are reported on a schedule following the statement of investments securities held by a futures commission merchant to cover initial margin requirements on open futures contracts are noted in the statement of investments cash held by a futures commission merchant to cover initial margin requirements on open futures contracts and the receivable andor payable for the daily mark to market for the variation margin are noted in the statement of assets and liabilities the net change in

exposure to interest rate risk     during the year ended january   the fund had an ending monthly average market value of  and  on futures contracts purchased and sold respectively     additional associated risks of entering into futures contracts and related options include the possibility that there may be an illiquid market where the fund is unable to liquidate the contract or enter into an offsetting position and if used for hedging purposes the risk that the price of the contract will correlate imperfectly with the prices of the funds securities           oppenheimer master inflation protected securities fund llc notes to financial statements  continued      risk exposures and the use of derivative instruments continued counterparty credit risk derivative positions are subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the fund the fund intends to enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that the manager believes to be creditworthy at the time of the transaction     for financial reporting purposes the fund does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities that are subject to netting arrangements in the statement of assets and liabilities bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy insolvency or other events     the funds risk of loss from counterparty credit risk on exchangetraded derivatives cleared through a clearinghouse and for centrally cleared swaps is generally considered lower than as compared to otc derivatives however counterparty credit risk exists with respect to initial and variation margin depositedpaid by the fund that is held in futures commission merchant broker andor clearinghouse accounts for such exchangetraded derivatives and for centrally cleared swaps     with respect to centrally cleared swaps such transactions will be submitted for clearing and if cleared will be held in accounts at futures commission merchants or brokers that are members of clearinghouses while brokers futures commission merchants and clearinghouses are required to segregate customer margin from their own assets in the event that a broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse becomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy and at that time there is a shortfall in the aggregate amount of margin held by the broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse for all its customers us bankruptcy laws will typically allocate that shortfall on a prorata basis across all the brokers futures commission merchants or clearinghouses customers potentially resulting in losses to the fund     there is the risk that a broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse will decline to clear a transaction on the funds behalf and the fund may be required to pay a termination fee to the executing broker with whom the fund initially enters into the transaction clearinghouses may also be permitted to terminate centrally cleared swaps at any time the fund is also subject to the risk that the broker or futures commission merchant will improperly use the funds assets depositedpaid as initial or variation margin to satisfy payment obligations of another customer in the event of a default by another customer of the broker or futures commission merchant the fund might not receive its variation margin payments from the clearinghouse due to the manner in which variation margin payments are aggregated for all customers of the brokerfutures commission merchant     collateral and margin requirements differ by type of derivative margin requirements are established by the broker futures commission merchant or clearinghouse for exchangetraded and cleared derivatives including centrally cleared swaps brokers futures commission merchants and clearinghouses can ask for margin in excess of the regulatory minimum or increase the margin amount in certain circumstances     for
