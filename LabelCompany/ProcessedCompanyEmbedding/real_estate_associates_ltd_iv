managing general partner of the real partnerships napico became officers directors andor equity owners of the reit pursuant to the approval of the limited partners a series of transactions were effectuated on or about december   that resulted in the transfer of the limited partnership interests in the local partnerships to either the reit or the reit sub a procedural background the plaintiffs commenced this action on august   pursuant to rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure on june   the court certified the plaintiffs to proceed with the action as representatives of the

introduction of evidence b factual background the plaintiffs the class or the real limited partners bring suit for the dissemination of false and misleading proxyconsent solicitation statements in violation of §  of the securities and exchange act of  the exchange act violation of the antibundling rules of the exchange act breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the doctrine of inherent fairness  the parties the plaintiffs are a class of persons and entities comprised of approximately  unitholders who held limited partnership interests in the real partnerships and were entitled to vote on one or more of the solicitations disseminated in august  in regard to the sale of certain limited partnership interests in the local partnerships the local partnership interests the defendants can be divided into two groups the casden defendants and the reit defendants the casden defendants include  napico and its subsidiaries and  alan i casden henry c casden charles h boxenbaum and bruce e nelson the individual defendants who comprised napicos board of directors at all relevant times napico is a whollyowned subsidiary of casden investment corp and casden investment corps sole director and stockholder is alan i casden alan casden is a general partner of casden properties which was a sponsor of the reit it is undisputed that the individual defendants were members of napicos board of directors and subsequently became officers directors andor equity owners of the reit it is also undisputed that napico the managing general partner of the real partnerships owed a fiduciary duty to the real partnerships and the limited partners napico recommended the reit transaction to the real limited partners and sought their consent to the reit transaction by means of the solicitations the reit defendants are the entities created and used by the individual defendants to purchase the real partnerships limited partnership interests in the  local partnerships in the reit transaction the reit defendants include  casden properties inc the sponsor of the reit  casden properties operating partnership the operating arm of the reit and  casden properties sub llc the reit sub and a subsidiary of the reit  the real partnerships the real partnerships as included in this litigation are california limited partnerships that were organized between  and  to acquire limited partnership interests in local partnerships whose purpose was to acquire ownership of andor construct multifamily often low income residential properties the properties the real partnerships focused their investments on properties that qualified for mortgages and housing assistance payments contracts hap contracts under section  of the united states housing act these local partnerships were limited partnerships that held title to the properties and also held cash reserves for capital improvements and mortgage payments and mortgages on the properties along with the limited partners the general partners the local gps also held interests in the local partnerships pursuant to the local partnership agreements the local gps operated managed and conducted the business of the local partnerships together the real partnerships interests and the local gps interests constituted one hundred percent of the equity ownership interests in the local partnerships napico marketed the interests in the real partnerships as tax shelters each of the local partnerships was structured as a tax sheltered investment a tax sheltered investment is one in which an initial cash investment is made for which the primary returns are tax benefits to the investor with little or no distributions of cash these investments were particularly attractive to high income and high net worth individuals  these investments were structured as limited partnerships and were beneficial to the investor taxpayer in the early years because they resulted in large deductions for depreciation and interest expense as a result of this phenomenon there is a certain point in time when the tax benefits tend to reverse themselves and result in phantom income phantom income is a distribution of taxable income without receiving the necessary distribution to pay the taxes on that income defs ex  schachter expert report at  the defendants contend that the reit transaction was structured to help the real limited partners exit stale tax shelters casden decl ¶  according to the defendants there were a number of reasons to exit the tax shelters including the decline of federal tax deductions because of the passage of time the impending end of federal depreciation of the properties at which time taxable income would begin to exceed cash distributions resulting in phantom income and the enactment of the multifamily assisted housing reform and affordability act of  mahraa id therefore via the solicitations the reit transaction was proposed  the allegations in august  the class approved the sale of the real partnerships limited partnership interests in the  local partnerships to the reit in addition to the limited partners approval of the reit transaction as required by the exchange act the reit transaction also depended on the sale of the local gps interests in the local partnerships to the reit the solicitations also sought the approval of the real limited partners for certain amendments to the real partnership agreements the defendants after receiving the real limited partners approval and negotiating to purchase the local gps interests completed the reit transaction on or about december   the closing the transfers from the real partnerships to the reit or reit sub were effected by a simultaneous transaction in which the reit or reit sub acquired i both the limited and general partnership interests in the local partnerships and ii interests not owned by the real partnerships including interests in other partnerships real estate properties management companies and other business entities including napico the amount of cash ultimately distributed to the real partnerships in connection with the reit transaction totaled approximately  million the plaintiffs allege that the reit transaction was created solely to benefit the casden and reit defendants and that if the solicitations had contained accurate information the class would not have approved the transfer of the real partnerships interests to the defendants in short it is alleged that the defendants structured and carried out a wrongful selfdealing transaction whereby the limited partnerships interests were transferred to the reit controlled by the managing general partner of the real partnerships and the individual defendants based on false and misleading statements in the solicitations and that the class received inadequate consideration for its securities the defendants argue essentially that the reit transaction was a fixed price offer which included a payment of cash andor the assumption of debt for the partnership interests in the local partnerships the plaintiffs seek  a rescission of the reit transaction including a declaration that all deeds and conveyances transferring the interests of the real partnerships to the reit defendants are null and void  an award of punitive and compensatory damages against the casden defendants for violation of rule a of the exchange act  an award of damages to reflect the fair market value of the reit transaction  restoration of the real partnerships and the class to their positions prior to the solicitations  enjoinment of the defendants from entering into any further transaction pursuant to the solicitations and an order setting aside the class vote as to the reit transaction  the removal of the casden defendants as the general partners of the real partnerships and the appointment of a receiver to administer and liquidate the real partnerships remaining assets and  the award of exemplary damages under california civil code §§ a and c ii discussion of section a claims a legal standard summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law fedrcivp c a genuine issue exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party and material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    sct   ledd   thus the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving partys claim is insufficient to defeat summary judgment id at   sct  in determining a motion for summary judgment all reasonable inferences from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party id at   sct  a courts role on summary judgment however is not to weigh the evidence ie issue resolution but rather to find genuine factual issues abduljabbar v general motors corp  fd   th cir b analysis  section a claims in general section  of the securities exchange act of  regulates the solicitation of proxies with respect to any security registered under the act rule a promulgated under section a prohibits solicitation of proxies by means of false or misleading proxy statements the purpose of § a is to prevent management or others from obtaining authorization for corporate action by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosure in proxy solicitation ji case co v borak  us    sct   ledd   the supreme court has recognized a private right of action under § a see id count i of the csrasc alleges a violation of § a and rule a promulgated thereunder against the casden defendants it alleges that the solicitations were materially false and misleading for a number of reasons and that the limited partners relied upon them in approving the sale of the  limited partnership interests in the local partnerships in order to establish a claim for damages under § a the plaintiffs must establish  that the solicitations contained a false or misleading statement of material fact or omission  that the misstatement or omission of a material fact was the result of knowing reckless or negligent conduct and  that the misstatement or omission caused injury to the plaintiffs tsc indus inc v northway inc  us   sct   ledd   an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote id at   sct  stated another way there must be a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would view the omitted or misleading facts as significantly altering the total mix of information made available in the proxy statement id section a and rule a do not obligate corporate officials to present no matter how unlikely every conceivable argument against their own recommendations desaigoudar v meyercord  fd   th cir they instead require that officials divulge all known material facts so that shareholders can make informed choices id citing ji case  us at   sct  the securities laws do not require that a proxy solicitation discuss all of the arguments against or all of the alternatives to the proposed course of action kahn v wien  fsupp   edny  the fixed price defense the defendants argue that regardless of the adequacy of the disclosures in the solicitations there can be no rule a violation as a matter of law because the solicitations offered a fixed price for the real partnerships interests the fixed amount offered to the real partnerships as well as the fixed amount of the proposed distributions are contained on the first page and elsewhere of each solicitation the reit paid these amounts contrary to the defendants assertions the fact that the solicitations offered a specific price for the real partnerships interests does not foreclose the possibility that triable issues of fact may exist regarding whether the solicitations contained materially false or misleading statements or whether the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs for example one of the plaintiffs allegations is that it was a materially false and misleading statement for the solicitations to represent that outstanding mortgage indebtedness would be subtracted in order to arrive at net distributable proceeds when in fact the subtracted mortgage indebtedness was calculated using september   figures and therefore not accurately described as outstanding the plaintiffs allege that the solicitations concealed the as of date of the mortgage balances given this allegation the fact that the solicitations offered a socalled fixed price for the real partnerships interests is irrelevant the specific price offered was arrived at using the very same figures that the plaintiffs attack as materially misleading ie the deduction of certain mortgage indebtedness which was not in fact outstanding therefore the court rejects the defendants fixed price defense and will proceed to analyze the plaintiffs claims individually  the underpayment claim the plaintiffs divide the allegations comprising the § a claim into two parts  the underpayment claim csrasc ¶¶  and  the hidden assets claim id ¶¶  in the underpayment claim the plaintiffs contend that the solicitations contained false and misleading statements about the amount due to the limited partners for the sale of their interests and that the class was damaged in that amount the solicitations set forth a methodology for valuing the interests of the limited partners that the reit sought to acquire the purchase price was determined by the managing general partner the managing general partner valued the real estate interests using the following methodology vol i defs ex  real ii at  the solicitations stated that based on certain assumptions the managing general partner arrived at an aggregate property valuation apv for the properties owned by the local partnerships and to be included in the sale the managing general partner subtracted from the aggregate property valuation i an amount for the aggregate estimated value of the general partnership interests in the local partnerships excluding the general partnership interests of the  local general partners that are affiliates of the managing general partner and the local general partners right to future management fees  and ii the outstanding mortgage indebtedness and related party indebtedness of the local partnerships of an amount id in short the solicitations state that the net distributable proceeds to be paid to the real partnerships were determined by subtracting the gp buyout costs from the apv to determine a purchase price next the purchase price was to be reduced by the amounts attributable to mortgages related party indebtedness and other liabilities including the costs of the transaction to arrive at net distributable proceeds to the real partnerships a mortgage amortization as noted above the solicitations stated that the managing general partner subtracted the outstanding mortgage indebtedness and related party indebtedness of the local partnerships from the purchase price in order to arrive at the net distributable proceeds the plaintiffs contend that the solicitations did not disclose sufficient information with respect to the mortgage balances used to calculate the net distributable proceeds specifically the plaintiffs contend that the defendants deducted the higher september   mortgage balances instead of the amounts that actually remained outstanding at the date of the closings december   the plaintiffs contend that there is a  million difference between the mortgages actually assumed by the reit and the higher september   balances deducted from the purchase price the plaintiffs claim that it was materially misleading for the solicitations to state the outstanding mortgage indebtedness would be deducted from the purchase price when the defendants in fact deducted the september   mortgage balance and retained the difference the plaintiffs argue that the solicitations do not contain adequate information to allow a real limited partner to discern that  mortgage balance information was considered in arriving at the purchase price the plaintiffs contend that even henry casden could not determine the as of date for the outstanding mortgage indebtedness that was subtracted from apv upon review of schedule iii the solicitations contained a schedule schedule iii referencing the outstanding mortgage balances for each local partnership as of december   defs ex  real i at  based on this information the defendants assert that a reader could have determined that the mortgage debt used to calculate the purchase price was based on  numbers including the introductory letter and the supplemental annexes a single solicitation statement approximately one  pages in length in the context of a complex lengthy document the fact that a single schedule found almost  pages into the document referenced a december   date for outstanding mortgage balances is not dispositive further the defendants argue that the solicitations do not state that mortgage debt would be amortized as of the date of closing or at any time in the future for purposes of the purchase offer the solicitations stated a fixed amount for the mortgage debt and related party debt according to the defendants the fact that an actual sum or number was used informed the reader that the debt was calculated already in the past however the fact that the number was calculated in the past would not necessarily inform the reader that the mortgage balances deducted were from september  i conclusion mortgage amortization the only place in the solicitations that the defendants identify as disclosing the use of  numbers in calculating the debt is threequarters of the way through the solicitation statement in a single annexed schedule the court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether a reasonable shareholder would have considered this information important in deciding how to vote and whether the solicitations contained materially false and misleading statements or omissions with respect to the mortgage balances used to calculate the net distributable proceeds b soft notes five of the real partnerships real iii real iv real vi real vii and housing financed their purchase of the local partnership interests with purchase money financing evidenced by subordinated contingent promissory notes referred to as related party indebtedness and soft notes the soft notes were used as partial payment for the acquisition of partnership interests in the local partnerships by real partnerships after the reit obtained the local general partners interests in the local partnerships the reit negotiated and obtained discounts on the soft notes the plaintiffs contend that the defendants paid  million for the soft notes but deducted the full face amount of the soft notes plus interest  million from the price being paid to the real partnerships thus diverting the benefit of  million to the reit in short the defendants allegedly omitted the actual purchase price of the soft notes and the amount of the discount from the solicitations the plaintiffs contend that it was materially misleading  to omit to disclose the discount and in the case of real iv real vi and housing to fail to disclose that the reit would receive the benefit of that discount  for the cover letters accompanying the solicitations to state that the reit would assume the soft note indebtedness when in fact the casden defendants had arranged to purchase the soft notes outright at a discount and  to state that the reit had negotiated to acquire the soft notes when it was in fact the casden defendants who acquired the soft notes in short the discount was material and its amount and who would benefit from it was material the defendants respond  each solicitation for the real partnership indebted under the soft notes disclosed that the full amount of the soft notes were deducted in arriving at the purchase price and  no solicitation stated that a discount from any soft note would inure to the benefit of the real partnerships therefore it is argued any discount from the soft notes did not affect the purchase price and disclosure regarding the specific amount of discounts ultimately realized by the reit was not required in addition the defendants argue the plaintiffs position that the solicitations should have revealed the magnitude of the discount is without merit because  the precise amount of the discount could not be disclosed because it was not known until after negotiations with the general partners were completed  the precise amount of the discount was irrelevant because the solicitations stated that the reit the entity paying to acquire the soft notes would receive the benefit of the discount not the real partnerships and  because the offering price was fixed no amount of disclosure could affect the price offered i real iii the solicitation for real iii disclosed that the benefit resulting from the purchase of the notes below the full amount inures to the benefit of the reit vol i defs ex  real iii at  it did not disclose the amount of the discount ii real iv the solicitation for real iv did not include any of the disclosures contained in the other solicitations about the existence of the soft notes the discount or the fact that the benefit of the discount would inure to the benefit of the reit real iv did include a chart entitled pro forma balance sheet adjustment which referenced notes and interest payable vol ii defs ex  real iv at  in the notes to financial statements section of the solicitation it also stated the partnership is obligated on nonrecourse notes  id at  iii real vi the solicitation for real vi included the general disclosure cited above in footnote  iv real vii the solicitation for real vii disclosed that the benefit resulting from the purchase of the notes at a discount from the full amount inures to the benefit of the reit id ex  real vii at  it did not disclose the amount of the discount v housing the solicitation for housing included the general disclosure cited above in footnote  vi conclusion soft notes at his deposition the defendants expert michael spindler testified that the language about which entity benefits from the purchase of the soft notes at a discount omitted from real iv real v and housing was relevant to putting the soft note differential into context defs ex  spindler depo at  he also testified that he would probably say that the language was the most important out of that section id according to spindler however he also believed that the real vi and housing solicitations contained other disclosures besides the who benefits language that would serve to notify a reader that the limited partners would not receive the benefit of the soft note discount spindler decl ¶  three solicitations real iv real vii and housing did not include the language explaining that the reit alone would benefit from the soft note discount in the case of real iv the solicitation failed to make any disclosure about the notes the court finds that these discounts were material and that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether a reasonable limited partner would have considered this information significant in deciding how to vote on the transaction and whether the solicitations disclosures about the soft notes contained materially false and misleading statements or omissions c local general partner buyout costs in determining the purchase price the solicitations disclosed that the estimated local gp buyout costs would be paid and that the cost would be subtracted from the apv the managing general partner expects that the general partners of the local partnerships will be paid an aggregate of approximately  amount for their interests in and rights to manage the local partnerships vol i defs ex  real i at  the solicitation continued to the extent that the ultimate cost of buying out the unaffiliated local general partners exceeds the managing general partners current estimate of such costs the distributions to limited partners resulting from the sale will be reduced to the extent that the cost of such buyouts is less than the managing general partners estimates distributions to limited partners will be increased id the plaintiffs contend that this was a materially false and misleading statement because no determinations of the ultimate local gp buyout costs were ever computed and the casden defendants failed to increase distributions when local gp buyout costs were lower than estimated i failure to deduct actual gp buyout costs the plaintiffs allege that the defendants over deducted  in local gp buyout costs when compared to the actual local gp buyout costs paid by the defendants and that the defendants failed to increase distributions to the class by the difference between the estimated and the actual buyout costs the defendants expert calculates that there is a  difference between the amount stated in the solicitations for gp buyout costs and the amount actually paid defs opp to pls mot ex  at  at his deposition alan casden testified that in regard to the local gp buyout costs estimated in the solicitations to my understanding there was a final — these local gp buyout costs were in flux and they were supposed to be adjusted to what the actuals were pls ex  a casden depo at  the defendants did not determine the actual gp buyout costs at a later time the defendants assert that the ultimate amount of gp buyout costs cannot yet be determined because of other pending litigation in the united states district courts for the southern district of new york and for the middle district of pennsylvania zito decl ¶¶  in addition the defendants argue that because the real partnerships are ongoing businesses it is premature for any final accounting with respect to the partnerships id ii deduction of local gp buyout costs that were never paid the plaintiffs contend that the defendants improperly deducted certain local gp buyout costs that were never paid including a defendants nonpayments to affiliates in the amount of  and b the mariners cove contingency reserve in the amount of  the plaintiffs attack the  million in costs associated with the purchase of the management rights of the twenty local general partners that were affiliated with the defendants arguing that taking credit for nonpayments is improper the defendants respond that the acquisition of these management rights by the reit was properly treated as a buyout cost although it did not involve an outofpocket cash expenditure also these deductions were disclosed in the solicitations vol ii defs ex  real vii at  no value was attributed to the affiliated general partners general partnership interests in local partnerships the defendants also assert that other liabilities were assumed for example in the case of mariners cove where a  million ground lease liability was assumed iii deduction of local gp buyout costs already paid the plaintiffs contend that although the local partnership interests in two projects bradley and farrell had already been acquired through litigation the plaintiffs paid the buyout costs in connection with the reit transaction the defendants dispute that anything was paid for these interests in connection with the reit transaction defs opp to pls mot ex  spindler rebuttal report the plaintiffs also contend that the defendants improperly deducted certain local gp buyout costs that included amounts already deducted as part of defendants subtraction made for soft notes the plaintiffs claim that in the case of management alliance properties the face amounts of the soft notes were deducted twice first as general partner buyout expense and second as a softnote payment expense the defendants respond that such deductions had no economic effect on the plaintiffs spindler decl ¶  iv conclusion local gp buyout costs the court finds that there are genuine issues of triable fact regarding whether the solicitations contained materially false or misleading statements regarding local gp buyout costs d conclusion underpayment claim the court finds that there are genuine issues of triable fact regarding the plaintiffs underpayment claim and that the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment in particular although not exclusively the court notes that the solicitations provided that the reit would assume certain mortgage and related party indebtedness and in each case listed the amount of the debt that the reit would assume it now appears that the reit did not in fact assume the stated amount of debt and that the reit in fact assumed millions of dollars less in debt than the solicitations described these facts alone raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the solicitations contained false and misleading statements or omissions  the hidden assets claim the plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to disclose the full value of the partnership assets which were proposed for sale in the solicitations in violation of § a the plaintiffs contend that the real partnerships had contractual rights in all the assets of the local partnerships however the plaintiffs argue the solicitations improperly focused solely on the properties to the exclusion of all other assets of the local partnerships by informing the limited partners that their approval was being sought to sell to the reit only certain real estate interests or the sale of the interests of the partnership  in the real estate assets vol i defs ex  real ii at  in short by focusing solely on the properties to the exclusion of other assets of local partnerships the defendants allegedly misrepresented or concealed the existence amount and materiality of the local partnerships assets other than properties a the plaintiffs interests in the local partnerships assets the defendants argue that the plaintiffs did not have any interest as a matter of law in the assets of the local partnerships a limited partner does not have a property interest in specific partnership assets calcorpcode §  see also wanetick v mels of modesto inc  fsupp   ndcal evans v galardi  cald   calrptr   pd   instead the plaintiffs held limited partnership interests in other limited partnerships which owned lowincome housing projects the court rejects the plaintiffs position that the real partnerships and thereby the real limited partners had an ownership interest in all of the property of the local partnerships by virtue of the real partnerships ownership of the limited partnership interests in the local partnerships however the local partnership agreements provide that the reals were entitled to receive distributions of cash from operations annually see eg pls ex  norristown local partnership agreement at napjjj therefore as limited partners the real partnerships would be entitled to a percentage of cash as provided by the partnership agreements on average in  and  the defendants state that the real partnerships would have been entitled to  of the surplus cash b surplus cash the plaintiffs contend that the solicitations omitted disclosures about cash assets held by the local partnerships in which the real partnerships had an ownership interest and that  million of this allegedly undisclosed cash was transferred to the reit escrow at fatcola at and prior to closing in short it is alleged that the defendants stripped  million in cash from the local partnerships and transferred it to the reit before closing and before preparation of  audited financial statements and that the cash belonged to the real partnerships representing  and  cash from operations and that the cash was material in light of the net distributable proceeds of  million actually paid to the class the plaintiffs contend that it was materially misleading for the solicitations to omit the word cash from the language and instead only to refer to assets other than properties the plaintiffs claim that the term assets other than properties was ambiguous and that no reasonable reader of the solicitations would have understood it to mean cash and reserves therefore the plaintiffs claim an entitlement to the distribution of cash from  and  operations held at the local partnership level on the ground that there was no disclosure in the solicitations that cash earned while the real partnerships owned an interest in the local partnerships ie through the date of closing would be directed to the reit the defendants response is twofold first the defendants contend that the real partnerships did not own cash and reserves in the local partnerships but only securities in the form of local partnership interests therefore the cash and reserves were not hidden assets of the real partnerships the real partnerships sold its securities in the local partnerships but the local partnerships did not sell their assets the plaintiffs simply had no interest in the cash and after the transfer of the interests were no longer entitled to any distributions the issue of the surplus cash is however distinct from the dispute about whether the plaintiffs had any ownership interests in the assets of the local partnerships the defendants admit that distributions of unrestricted cash were made from the local partnerships to the real partnerships in  and  pursuant to the terms of the local partnership agreements of this surplus cash the defendants argue the real partnerships would only be entitled to a percentage of the cash as provided by the partnership agreement spindler reply decl ¶  on average in  and  the real partnerships were entitled to only  of the surplus cash that was distributed id thus the question becomes whether the solicitations contained material misstatements or omissions regarding the plaintiffs contractual entitlements to cash from  or  operations the defendants assert that the surplus cash available as of december   belonged to the buyer ie the reit the defendants expert spindler concluded that the amount of cash actually available for distribution as of december   was  million id he also concluded the valuation methodology was disclosed in the consent solicitations and was based on  operating data and september   balance sheet data it is our understanding that the defendants take the position that since the buyout was done as of september  subsequent surplus cash would inure to the buyers since surplus cash is generally distributed annually the  of surplus cash as of december   relates to  operations and thus belongs to the buyer additionally there is at least an equal amount of seller costs paid by the buyers related to this transaction that have not been charged to the sellers id finally the defendants argue that the solicitations disclosed that value was not ascribed to the cash and reserves the solicitations disclosed that the cash was not considered part of the purchase price because the reit was also assuming certain liabilities the solicitations provide in determining the valuation of the real estate interests no adjustment was made for the amount by which the value of the assets other than the properties exceeded liabilities other than mortgage and certain related party indebtedness because the managing general partner does not believe these assets are material other than the reserve accounts referred to below in addition pursuant to certain state housing finance statutes and regulations certain of the local partnerships are subject to limitations on the distributions of dividends to the partnership such statutes and regulations require such local partnerships to hold cash flows in excess of such dividend limitations in reserve accounts that may be used only for limited purposes the purchase price was calculated without attributing value of the reserve accounts the managing general partner believes that federal and state regulatory considerations limiting the availability of the reserve accounts to the partnerships have the effect of substantially reducing or eliminating entirely any value attributable to such reserve accounts nonetheless the reit may be able to realize a benefit in the future by obtaining a reduction in the amount required to be held in the reserve accounts the partnership held approximately an amount in such reserve accounts at december   vol i defs ex  real i at  emphasis added it is undisputed that distributions of unrestricted cash were made from the local partnerships to the real partnerships in  and  pls proposed uncon fact ¶  it is the defendants position that after the transfer of interests the plaintiffs were no longer entitled to distributions defs response to pls proposed uncon fact ¶  however the plaintiffs position is that they remained entitled to certain cash distributions as long as they continued to own the limited partnership interests and that the reit improperly diverted these funds into an escrow account rather than distributing them in accordance with the local partnership agreements the court finds that genuine issues of triable fact exist regarding whether the solicitation contained false or misleading statements or omissions about the plaintiffs entitlement to any distributions of cash from the local partnerships operations for calendar years  and  c reserves each of the local partnerships that owned section  properties were required to keep specified types of mortgage escrows and reserves for capital improvements and maintenance and for profits in excess of the percentage that the local partnerships could distribute in a given year the plaintiffs argue that in the solicitations the defendants misrepresented and understated the magnitude of the aggregate reserves in which the real partnerships held an interest through nondisclosure of the magnitude of the reserves and escrows coupled with the misrepresentations that they had no value it is alleged that the casden defendants took valuable assets for the reit specifically it is alleged that only  million in reserves were disclosed instead of  million actually held by local partnerships with respect to the reserve accounts the defendants argue that not only do the real partnerships not own the reserve accounts but further that various regulatory agreements with the hud mean that hud essentially owns the cash in these residual receipt accounts the defendants also argue that regardless of the amount of the reserves the specific amounts and types of reserves did not affect the purchase price because it was a fixed price deal and therefore the reserves could not have been material the court has already rejected this argument finally the solicitations stated that the purchase price was calculated without attributing value to reserve accounts each solicitation stated that federal and state limitations on the use of reserves substantially reduced or eliminated their value and that therefore the purchase price was calculated without attributing value to the reserve accounts the court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether the solicitations contained materially false or misleading statements or omissions about the reserves d conclusion hidden assets the court finds that triable issues of genuine material fact remain as to whether the solicitations adequately disclosed that cash from  and  operations would go to the reit rather than to the plaintiffs and the adequacy of the solicitations disclosures regarding the local partnerships reserves c conclusion section a claim  valuation and santa fe industries according to the defendants by adjusting the manner in which the purchase price for the local partnership interests was determined the plaintiffs are simply putting forth their opinion regarding the value of the plaintiffs interests or how the interests should have been valued the solicitations explicitly disclosed that other methods existed for valuing the interests at issue see eg vol i defs ex  real i at  different assumptions would likely have resulted in different valuations for the real estate interests therefore the defendants argue at heart this is nothing more than a dispute about the proper valuation of the local partnership interests a valuation dispute however is not actionable under federal securities law santa fe indus inc v green  us   sct   ledd   holding that once full and fair disclosure has occurred the fairness of the terms of the transaction is at most a tangential concern of the statute stepak v aetna life  cas co  wl    dconn the plaintiff asserts that aetnas appraisal practices and valuation methodology as well as aetnas nondisclosure of those policies in their reports to shareholders violate the federal securities laws the court concludes that the plaintiffs claim constitutes a claim of corporate mismanagement not actionable under the securities laws while the plaintiffs may complain about the adequacy of the price set for the reit transaction it is argued the terms of the transaction were adequately disclosed precluding § a liability gluck v agemian  fsupp  sdny however as discussed above the court finds that there are triable issues of genuine material fact regarding whether full and fair disclosure occurred in this case thus distinguishing it from santa fe or other cases where the dispute was reducible to competing notions of the value of the underlying interests in this case factual disputes remain about the adequacy of the disclosures in the solicitations and therefore the defendants characterization of the action as nothing more than a dispute about valuation is inaccurate  in general the defendants contend that the alleged omissions from the solicitations were readily discernible through a reading of that document and that the plaintiffs could have used simple addition to determine for example that the mortgage debt used to calculate the purchase price was based on  numbers see eg data probe acquisition corp v datatab inc  fd   d cir no securities fraud in failing to state conclusion that was obvious to anyone conversant with elementary mathematics howell v management assistance inc  fsupp   sdny no violation of proxy solicitation rules where cash flow calculations could be easily made as plaintiff testified he had done from the data in the proxy materials however the plaintiffs allegations are distinguishable from those cases cited above where critical calculations could easily be made or certain conclusions were obvious to anyone conversant in basic mathematics in this case the complexity of the reit transaction and the length of the solicitations meant that the calculations and conclusions set forth in the solicitations were comprehensible only to those with a high level of expertise and familiarity with the reit transaction given this context the court finds that triable genuine issues of material fact remain regarding the plaintiffs underpayment claim and the plaintiffs hidden assets claim and whether the solicitations contained material misstatements or omissions in violation of § a of the exchange act iii breach of fiduciary duty claim the plaintiffs claim that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to fully and completely disclose all the facts surrounding the reit transaction a the individual defendants do not owe the plaintiffs a fiduciary duty it is undisputed that as managing general

a nonexhaustive list of some of the triable issues of fact that the court finds remain with respect to the plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claim against napico  mortgage amortization the plaintiffs contend it was a breach of fiduciary duty to use the september   mortgage balances instead of the amounts that actually remained outstanding at the date of the closings because the casden defendants wrongfully converted five quarters of the mortgage payments to the benefit of the reit the plaintiffs contend that the defendants impermissibly extracted payment from the limited partners for a debt that was already paid and wrongfully appropriated partnership property for their own gain people v sobiek  calappd   calrptr   oakdale village group v fong  calappth    calrptrd   the court finds that triable issues of fact exist with respect to this issue  soft notes the plaintiffs contend that it was a per se violation of the casden defendants fiduciary duties to arrange for the reit to acquire the soft notes at less than the face value and in the case of three of the reals to fail to disclose that the reit and not the limited partners would benefit from the discount and to conceal the discount but deduct the full face amount from the apv the plaintiffs argue that where a partner acquires a partnership obligation at a discount he does so on behalf of the partnership and his copartners and each partner is entitled to share in the discount therefore the partner may not seek to recover the full amount of the obligation from the partnership or his partners in order to retain the discount for himself bt v equitable  calappth at   calrptrd  the plaintiffs contend that the opportunity to purchase the soft notes at a discount was a partnership opportunity belonging to

were entitled to share in the benefit of the soft notes discount  local gp buyout costs the plaintiffs attack the defendants conduct in relation to the calculation of the local gp buyout costs on a number of grounds including the failure to increase the purchase price in order to reflect the actual costs of the buyouts the court finds that triable issues of fact exist with respect to this issue  cash and reserves the plaintiffs contend that given their rights to the assets of the local partnerships it was a breach of fiduciary duty for the defendants to acquire the unrestricted cash of the local partnerships without compensation to the real partnerships similarly the plaintiffs contend that the defendants improperly took the reserves for the reit without compensating the real partnerships a fiduciarys purchase or sale of partnership assets without a full disclosure of their value constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty as a matter of law lund v albrecht  fd  th cir affirming summary judgment in favor of plaintiff where defendant partner failed to disclose an offer to purchase partnership assets for  million to  million more than value assumed in dissolution negotiations with plaintiff the court finds that triable issues of fact remain regarding whether napico breached its fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs in regard to reits acquisition of cash from operations for the  and  years and the reserve accounts c standing the defendants also argue that as limited partners the plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims for wrongs allegedly committed against the partnership and that their claims are derivative in nature the defendants contend that the wrong or injury the limited partners incurred if any is incidental to the wrong suffered by the real partnerships the recovery must go to the real partnerships not to members of the class mieuli v debartolo  wl    ndcal pareto v fdic  fd  th cir  the plaintiffs point out that the solicitations sought the consent of the class to the reit transaction the result of which was the payment to each real limited partner of the net distributable proceeds payable on a perunit basis to each real limited partner therefore the plaintiffs damages resulted from a direct injury to the limited partners the hallmark of an individual rather than derivative claim dowling v narragansett capital corp  fsupp   dri the court finds that because the solicitations stated that the sale would result in the distribution of the sale proceeds directly to the limited partners the instant case is distinguishable from the authorities cited by the defendants and therefore the plaintiffs have standing to maintain this action d conclusion breach of fiduciary duty the court finds that triable issues of material fact remain regarding whether napico acted in the highest good faith or obtained any advantage over the real limited partners in the partnership affairs by the slightest misrepresentation concealment threat or adverse pressure of any kind therefore with the exception of the individual defendants who are not fiduciaries the court denies the defendants motion for summary judgment on this ground iv state law claims the csrasc alleges additional federal securities and state law claims against the defendants a antibundling claim rule a of the exchange act sets

cause of action exists for a violation of rule a is a question of first impression in the ninth circuit in koppel v  corporation et al the second circuit addressed this same issue also as one of first impression and held that an implied right of private action existed under rule a for violations of rules aa and ab  fd   d cir assuming arguendo that a private cause of action for a violation of the antibundling provisions exists in this circuit the court must now examine what constitutes bundling in an antibundling claim the question for the court is whether or not the issues that are bundled together constitute separate matters id at  the fact that a proxy statement was filed or examined by the sec shall not be deemed a finding by the sec that the sec has approved any statement contained therein  cfr § ab in koppel the second circuit held that in the absence of explicit guidance from the applicable state law the actual issue of what constitutes a separate matter for purposes of the two rules is ultimately a question of fact to be determined in light of the corporate documents and in consideration of the secs apparent preference for more voting items rather than fewer id at  in

therewith including the execution on behalf of the partnership of such amendments instruments and documents as shall be necessary to reflect the transfer of the general and limited partnership interests and to authorize the general managing partner to sell any remaining real estate interests not transferred to such real estate investment trust or its affiliates pursuant to the proposal without further consent of the limited partner defs mot ex  at  emphasis added the plaintiffs claim that the underlined language is a bundled separate matter which allows the defendants to transfer assets unrelated to the reit transaction without further consent of the plaintiffs the plaintiffs contend that the phrase authorizes the sale of any and all of the remaining assets in the real partnerships the defendants respond that the language of the ballot is simply a catchall power designed to enable the proxy holder to do all that is necessary to effect the transaction for which the consent is solicited the defendants contend that the plain language of the consent form while inartful defs mot at  does not support the plaintiffs antibundling claim the phrase in question contains the language pursuant to this proposal id this language is limiting and restricts the sale of any remaining real estate interests to those detailed in the solicitations the court finds that triable issue of fact exist with respect to the whether defendants bundled separate matters in violation of rule a of the exchange act and therefore summary judgment for the defendants is inappropriate on this claim b doctrine of inherent fairness in jones v hf ahmanson  co the california supreme court held that when a majority shareholder usurps a corporate opportunity or otherwise harms the minority

of partners while california law holds that a fiduciary relationship exists between general and limited partners it does not hold that the doctrine of inherent fairness extends to partnerships id the plaintiffs do not cite any authority to the contrary therefore the court grants the defendants motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs claim for breach of the doctrine of inherent fairness count vi in the csrasc c declaratory judgment regarding indemnification the ripeness doctrine protects against premature adjudication of suits in which declaratory relief is sought abbott labs v

be entitled to indemnification from the real partnerships if there is a finding that the defendants violated rule a of the exchange act or their fiduciary duties riverhead sav bank v national mortgage equity corp  fd   th cir because there is no case or controversy between the parties the plaintiffs claim for a declaratory judgment regarding indemnification is not sufficiently concrete to make relief appropriate therefore the plaintiffs claim for a declaratory relief does not meet the first prong of the test for ripeness assuming arguendo that the plaintiffs claim is sufficiently concrete to warrant a disposition the parties will not suffer hardship if a decision on indemnification is delayed until after a trial on the merits if the plaintiffs prevail the defendants do not dispute that the defendants will not be entitled to indemnification and that they will be required to repay the real partnerships the costs of their legal fees as required by the real partnership agreements

two additional interests and were sold at an original cost of  per unit for real i a unit consists of one limited partnership interest that was sold at an original cost of  per unit for real v a unit consists of two limited partnership interests that was sold at an original cost of  per unit  in addition to napico the other defendants collectively referred to as the managing general partner include casden investment corporation national partnership investments associates npia national partnership investments associates ii npia ii coast housing investments associates chia and housing programs corporation ii hpc ii csrasc ¶   the solicitations made a number of disclosures about the potential conflict of interest created by the fact that the reit sponsors were affiliates of napico the managing general partner for example the solicitations disclosed the following  the terms of the sale have not been negotiated at armslength vol i defs ex  at  real i  the managing general partner has approved the sale has concluded that the sale including the aggregate property valuation  is fair to the limited partners and recommends that the limited partners consent to the sale limited partners should note however that the managing general partners recommendation is subject to inherent conflicts of interest id at   in evaluating the proposed sale limited partners should consider that casden is both the sponsor of the reit and an affiliate of the managing general partner if the reit is successfully formed and capitalized the current owners of casden are likely to realize a substantial increase in the value and liquidity of their investment in casden properties the terms of the sale have been determined on behalf of the partnership by officers and directors of casden who will directly benefit from the sale unlike casden the limited partners will not participate in the reit  id at   the terms of the sale including the purchase price were established by the reit and the managing general partner which are related parties without the participation of any independent financial or legal advisor there can be no assurance that armslength negotiations would not have resulted in terms more favorable to the limited partners id at  and  the officers and employees of casden and its affiliates will be employed by the reit napico will become a subsidiary of the reit id  the original offering memoranda provide that the partnership objectives in order of chronological importance are  providing tax benefits on a current basis including deductions for interest depreciation and taxes to the extent permitted by law  obtaining reasonable protection for the partnerships capital investments  providing potential for appreciation subject to considerations of capital preservation and  providing potential for future cash distributions from operations on a limited basis refinancing or sale of a project  vol iv defs ex  at  the solicitations state the properties do not currently produce significant cash flow and the partnership has not made any distributions to date the partnerships investment in the properties was initially structured primarily to obtain tax benefits and not to provide cash distributions vol i defs ex  at   the parties dispute whether  to  the plaintiffs calculations of the limited partners approved the sale of the limited partnership interests or  to  the defendants calculations the plaintiffs dispute the defendants statistics because the solicitation statements provided that because approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote against the sale vol ii defs ex  real iv at  therefore the defendants calculations based only on consideration of those limited partners who returned a completed consent form are distorted because they fail to take into account those limited partners who did not vote and pursuant to the solicitations whose vote must be counted as a no vote  the solicitations sought to eliminate the following provisions from the real partnership agreements  to eliminate the prohibition against the sale of real interests for amounts that were not at least equal to the projected tax liability created as a consequence of the sale the tax requirement  to eliminate the prohibition against the sale of any of the properties or real estate interests to the general partners or their affiliates vol ii defs ex  real iv at  and  to eliminate the requirement that any agreement entered into between the partnership and the managing general partner or an affiliate may be cancelled at any time by the partnership without penalty within  days prior written notice the termination provision the solicitations stated by approving such amendment the limited partners are relinquishing a potential benefit conferred by the terms of the partnership agreement however the managing general partner believes that as a result of i recent legislation relating to governmentassisted housing which is expected to reduce the cash flow from the properties and create possible adverse tax consequences to the owners of the properties and ii the substantial negative capital accounts which most limited partners have which will result in recognition of significant gain on a sale of the real estate interests  the tax requirement would prevent sales of properties  which are in the best interests of the limited partners vol i defs ex  real i at  real vii iv and housing also state the managing general partner believes that it would not be possible to find a buyer willing to purchase the real estate interests under the conditions currently specified in the partnership agreements because compliance with such conditions would result in a purchase price for the properties substantially higher than their fair market value vol ii defs ex  real vii at   following the reit transaction the local partnerships remained as legal entities csrasc ¶  affiliated entities to the operating partnership was designated as replacement general partners of the local partnerships to replace the local gps when they withdrew as part of the reit transaction  according to the defendants the aggregate apv was  for all real partnerships the estimated lower tier general partner buyouts totaled  and the related party indebtedness totaled  the purchase price was  and net distributable proceeds were estimated to be  the net distributable proceeds figure included  million for the sale of the limited partnership interests in the local partnerships and distributions to the limited partners totaling  as a tax kicker defs response to pls proposed uncon fact ¶   rule a provides no solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made by means of any proxy statement form of proxy notice of meeting or other communication written or oral containing any statement which at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made is false or misleading with respect to any material fact or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading  cfr § a  the payments to the real partnerships were the same as the amount set forth in the solicitations with one exception spindler decl ¶  with respect to real ii the solicitations stated that  would be paid whereas the actual amount paid was  the decrease was a result of the removal of either one or several it is disputed local partnerships from the sale prior to closing id ¶  these facts directly contradict the plaintiffs assertion that they were not paid what was provided for in the solicitations pls opp at   a third and final component of the § a claim is entitled the sweetheart deals csrasc ¶¶  in which the plaintiffs allege that the defendants purchased the silence and support to the reit transaction of the three largest holders of real partnership units thus tainting the vote  according to the plaintiffs the underpayment claim seeks judicial implementation of the methodology set forth in the solicitations for calculating the net distributable proceeds the plaintiffs contend that the court should find as a matter of law that the pricing formula was not applied as it was described resulting in damages to the class of more than  million i chimicles decl at  the defendants argue that this claim essentially transforms the a claim into a breach of contract claim ie asserting that the defendants promised to calculate the net distributable proceeds using a certain methodology the class consented and voted for the sale and the defendants then failed to apply the promised methodology for purposes of ruling on this motion the court interprets the plaintiffs allegations regarding the underpayment claim as follows that the solicitations contained materially false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the mortgage amortization as of dates local gp buyout costs and soft notes both their existence and the question of discount  according to the defendants supplemental amended and revised objections and response to plaintiffs interrogatories the september   outstanding mortgage balances for the properties owned by the local partnerships equaled  pls ex  at ex  at louis eksteens defendants rule b witness on the subject of mortgage balances deposition he produced a schedule that set forth the mortgage balances of the properties as of december   and calculated that they equaled  based on the plaintiffs calculations there is a  million differential eksteen also testified that mortgage amortization paid by the local partnerships from the period october   to december   benefitted the reit or an affiliate pls ex  eksteen depo at  without relying on any disputed expert report or opinion but simply by reference to these exhibits the court finds that there is a material differential between the mortgage balances assumed by the defendants and those balances used to calculate the purchase price for the interests  q by going to those schedules do you believe you could determine that the asof date used is september th  a no because these schedules are relating to december  of  q okay well if i represent to you that the date used for the outstanding mortgage indebtedness was the balances as of september   does that come as a surprise to you is that the first time youre hearing it a yes vol xii pls ex  h casden depo at   according to the defendants the portion of the buyout costs allocated to soft notes was in fact  see defs ex  at   the plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants were personally involved in negotiating on behalf of the reit the purchase terms and price of the local gps interests including the soft notes i chimicles decl ¶  the defendants do not dispute that henry casden on behalf of the reit negotiated with gps to purchase the local gps interests including the acquisition of the soft notes h casden decl ¶   with the exception of real iv all the other solicitations for partnerships with soft notes disclosed that as part of its purchase of the partnership interests and management contracts of the general partners of the local partnerships the reit has also simultaneously negotiated the purchase of certain promissory notes held by such local general partners the notes based on an implied valuation below the face value of the notes the notes which have an aggregate value of approximately an amount including accrued and unpaid interest were issued by the local partnerships or the partnership in connection with its calculation of the purchase price the managing general partner deducted the face value of the notes from the aggregate property valuation because the notes represent payments due to the local general partners before any distributions from the local partnerships to the partnership may be made out of the proceeds of a sale of the properties defex  real vii at  emphasis added  as of august  when the consent solicitations were mailed to the real limited partners my negotiations with the lt general partners had not been completed h casden decl ¶  the plaintiffs assert that the defendants knew the amount of the soft notes discount at the time the solicitations were disseminated ii chimicles decl ¶¶  in reply the defendants have submitted the declaration of kristen surprenant a former casden employee who worked on the formation of the reit according to surprenant the precise amount of consideration to be paid to the lt general partners and the discounts on the soft notes was not known at the time the solicitations were distributed surprenant decl ¶  the court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the amount of the discount at which the reit would acquire the soft notes was known at the time of the solicitations the plaintiffs contend that the defendants knew with certainty at the time the solicitation statements were prepared and disseminated to the real limited partners that the soft notes would be purchased for far less than the face amount i chimicles decl at ¶  an earlier version of the draft real iii solicitation statement around july   included the following sentence in the section about soft notes the managing partner estimates that the aggregate discount for the soft notes relating to the partnership will be approximately  pls ex  eksteen ex  this information was not contained in the final version of the real iii solicitation statement or in any of the four other solicitations of reals that had soft notes the defendants respond that this is simply an error and is clearly nonsensical because real iii only had  in soft notes  the defendants also argue that the plaintiffs were not entitled to benefit from the soft notes discount and the solicitations disclosed that the reit might benefit from the transaction in certain ways not available to the limited partners for example the solicitations provided the reit believes that there are certain benefits not available to the partnership that the reit may be able to realize as a result of the acquisition of the real estate interests held by the partnership the general partner interests held by the local general partners the insured mortgage debt encumbering the properties and the other properties and business of casden these potential benefits include i earning fee income by performing the property management functions formerly performed by the local general partners ii acquiring and restructuring under mahraa the mortgage indebtedness to which the properties are subject and iii realizing economies of scale in connection with the ownership and management of all of the properties these benefits would not be available to the partnership because it does not have sufficient capital to buy out the local general partner interests and to purchase the mortgage loans encumbering the properties such activities would also be inconsistent with the partnerships original objectives vol i defs ex  real i at  emphasis added the defendants argue that the plaintiffs seek to receive the benefits of the reit transaction although it was the defendants who took the risk of spending hundreds of millions of dollars and who unlike the plaintiffs had the resources to acquire the lt general partnership interests in fact the defendants argue it was blackacre capital llc which funded the reit with the  million necessary to effect the purchase of the lt general partnership interests and the lt limited partnership interests in other words the defendants received the benefit of the soft notes discount by virtue of the use of their  million to purchase all of the interests  the local gp buyout costs for local general partners affiliated with managing general partner consisted of their right to receive future management fees but not their partnership interest the costs for unaffiliated local general partners were for the partnership interests and their right to future management fees the actual amounts paid to the unaffiliated local general partners varied based upon the negotiations with the local general partners the plaintiffs contend that for  of the affiliated local gps involved in the reit transaction the defendants subtracted approximately  million from the apv for the right to receive future management fees but that amount was never paid to the affiliated gps instead only nominal amounts were paid  the plaintiffs of course dispute this vigorously a real partnerships interests in a local partnership would necessarily reflect the value of all assets of the local partnership not just the real estate i chimicles decl ¶  the plaintiffs claim that the reals had contractual entitlements in these assets pursuant to the local partnership agreements i chimicles decl ¶¶   for example in  approximately  in cash was distributed to the real partnerships pls ex  at ex  in  approximately  in cash was distributed to the real partnerships pls ex  at ex   however alan casden testified q in your view to whom did the bank accounts and those other assets belong a well we bought partnership interest so we owned the partnership it belonged to the partnership that we bought q but to whom did those assets belong before you bought them mr zito objection the witness it belonged to the local gp and the limited partners or to the real funds whoever owned them pls ex  a casden depo at   it is the defendants position that since surplus cash is generally distributed annually the  of surplus cash as of december   relates to  operations and thus belongs to the buyer the distribution occurred in january of  even assuming arguendo that the real partnerships could establish an entitlement to such surplus cash  of that surplus cash would have to be applied to the indebtedness of the real partnerships to napico the  surplus cash was distributed in  rather than in the year  because as part of the reit transaction the reit obtained control over the cash distributable from the local limited partnerships pls ex  defs suppl amended  revised obj  resp to pls ints resp  at p  ex  and   however at his deposition charles boxenbaum was asked q whom do you believe should have received the benefit of cash from operations from local partnership operations in  a the local general partner and the general partnerships q which partnership a the selling partnership q the real partnerships a uhhuh      q  do you have any recollection of being told that cash from operations from  were going to be transferred to the reit a no pls ex  boxenbaum depo at   the defendants contend that value was not attached to these assets because the purchase price was calculated based on a capitalized income approach and because cash and reserves do not contribute to such income no value was attributed to them the solicitations disclosed that the managing general partner determined the value by taking the aggregate net operating income before interest expense and management fees  for such local partnership for  less capital expenditures and applied a capitalization rate of  vol ii defs ex  real vi at   cash distributions were made to the limited partners of the real partnerships on one occasion only in december  defs ex  real vii at   it is undisputed that a portion of the cash flow of the properties must be held in the local limited partnerships as reserves for such purposes set forth in the housing act and local regulations the defendants contend that the cash could not be used by the local partnerships and upon exiting the section  program would become the property of hud or a state agency defs stmtuncon facts ¶  the plaintiffs contend that the cash was available for distribution in certain circumstances and that the casden defendants misrepresented and concealed this fact  the maywalt court also noted that pennsylvania law recognizes a fiduciary relationship between general partners and limited partners clement v clement  pa   ad   however unlike the exception recognized by the texas courts the pennsylvania supreme court has refused to pierce the partnership veil and find the shareholders of corporate general partners liable to limited partners for breach of fiduciary duty see in re estate of hall  pa   ad   there is no california authority directly on point  in abrams the court found that the plaintiffs allegations of alter ego liability were sufficient to support certain claims against the general partners general partner including breach of fiduciary duty on a theory of de facto partnership thus the courts holding was that a general partners general partner may owe a fiduciary duty to the limited partner in cases where that secondtier general partner is in fact the alter ego of the firsttier general partner  the consent forms for all the solicitations contained substantially the same language  laux v freed stands for the unremarkable proposition that a fiduciary relationship exists between two partners  cald    calrptr   pd   there is no dispute that napico owed the plaintiffs a fiduciary duty in robinson leatham  nelson inc v nelson the court does not apply the doctrine of inherent fairness to a partnership agreement rather it dismisses the plaintiffs citing of the doctrine as being unrelated to the issue to be decided by the court  fd   th cir wehner holds that in a partnership between brothers beyond fiduciary duties founded in law an actual relationship of confidence and trust exists  while the suit was initiated prior to the reit transaction the plaintiffs did not move for an injunction preventing the reit transaction from being
