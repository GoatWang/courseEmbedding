berkshire hathaway mutual fund  stocks owned by warren buffett mutual fund investing that costs nothing nada zip free rob berger march   advertising disclosure doughroller receives compensation from some companies issuing financial products like credit cards and bank accounts that appear on this site unless a post is clearly marked sponsored however products mentioned in editorial articles and reviews are based on the authors subjective assessment of their value to readers not compensation compensation may impact how and where products appear on noneditorial pages eg comparison or marketplace pages that said our standard is that we will never accept advertising from a product which we wouldnt use ourselves × what do home depot anheuser busch and carmax have in common here’s a hint bank of america american express and general electric have the same thing in common the answer is they are all investments by a “mutual fund” that does not charge you a load fee or annual expenses you’ve no doubt heard of index funds that charge  or so a year in expenses well how does  sound if you like free in your mutual fund forget vanguard or fidelity instead think berkshire hathaway stocks owned by berkshire hathaway on friday berkshire hathaway filed what is called a form fhr with the securities and exchange commission this document lists the shares that berkshire hathaway owns in publicly traded companies as an institutional investment manager berkshire is required to disclose its holdings which allows us to get a peak at warren buffett’s investment decisions all in berkshire disclosed about  billion in investments give or take a billion or two so here’s the list of companies berkshire has invested in which should give you an idea why i view berkshire more as a mutual fund than a more typical publicly traded company american express co anheuser busch cos bank of america corp burlington northern santa fe carmax inc coca cola comcast corp comdisco holding co conocophillips costco wholesale corp eaton corporation gannett inc general electric co glaxosmithkline home depot inc ingersollrd company iron mountain inc johnson  johnson kraft foods inc lowes companies inc m  t bank corporation moody’s nrg energy inc nike inc norfolk southern corp procter  gamble co sanofi aventis sun trusts banks inc torchmark corp us bancorp usg corporation union pacific corp united parcel service inc united health group inc wabco holdings inc walmart stores inc washington post co wells fargo  co wellpoint inc wesco finl corp so what’s the most amazing thing about the above list of investments it’s so short imagine having  billion to invest and putting it all in fewer than  companies gulp now one could take a look at this list and think they’ll just invest in the same companies to mirror the performance of warren buffett the results would be shall we say unfortunate for several reasons first berkshire does not invest just in public companies in fact some of its best investments have been in privately held entities particularly in the insurance industry geico is perhaps the best known example of a private company that berkshire purchased lock stock and barrel the flexibility to by in whole or in part private companies is one of the reasons i prefer berkshire over large cap domestic mutual funds unlike mutual funds berkshire is not limited to investing in public companies second what made or will make the above investments so profitable turns on how much buffett paid for the shares in other words it is not just what you invest in that counts but also when you make your investment timing is everything and buffett’s timing is generally impeccable third buffett can get deals you and i never could the terms he received in his recent investment in general electric preferred stock comes only when you have  billion or so to investment call it a volume discount even buffett and berkshire can lose money as bullish as i am on buffett and berkshire they are not immune from less than rosy results last week berkshire filed its quarterly financial statements for the period ending september   public companies must file quarterly reports with the sec on form q they file annual reports on form k and what all called current reports on form k anyway in the q berkshire reported quarterly net income of  billion while a billion dollars in net income for one quarter doesn’t sound so bad in the same quarter last year the company reported  billion in net income a decline in net income of more than  is less than stellar the declining income was due to insurance related declines and investment losses more about these losses in a minute in other words not even berkshire is immune from market declines after the release of the q i had a chance to discuss the results with warren buffett no i didn’t he told me that if investors where unhappy they can sell their stock no he didn’t in fact he’d buy it from them he probably would be he didn’t tell me that but if i had called mr buffett and if he had taken my call he would have said the following great blog dough i read it everyday what it could happen investors should get use to single digit returns for the foreseeable future quarterly results generally are nothing but noise that should be ignored we’ve been lucky the last few years with relatively few major catastrophic insurance losses don’t expect the luck to last now that hasn’t stopped some from dumping their berkshire shares calpers the california public employees’ retirement system recently sold its stake in berkshire hathaway along with other investments such as bank of america but calpers has found itself in a fine mess it had capital calls from hedge fund investments that cost it a small fortune and it has mounting losses from speculative real estate investments so much for the experts berkshire mutual fund so let’s get back to berkshire i’ve started investing money each month in berkshire my plan is to have berkshire stock replace my large cap mutual fund investments in my taxable account not k or ira accounts there are no loads to pay i purchase the stock through sharebuilder which costs just  a trade and there are no annual expense ratios to deal with management in omaha does take away from net income but as a percentage of invested capital the cost is minuscule as you can see from the list of investments above which does not include the privately held companies at berkshire the company is well diversified if i have any concern it is its heavy investment in insurance buffett just loves the insurance model he collects premiums today that won’t result in payouts for years and can invest the money during the interim i take some comfort in the rock solid balance sheet at berkshire and buffett’s history of investing success and as the market goes down including the price of berkshire i take comfort in the fact that my monthly investment is buying more and more of berkshire hathaway berkshire hathaway plunges more than  in one day if you think the above heading is fictional check out what berkshire’s share price did yesterday it was not pretty the a share is now down to  from a previous high of over  yesterday’s plunge was due to are you ready for this investor fear resulting from the fact that berkshire credit default swaps were trading at  basis points up from  two months ago huh in english that means that the cost to ensure  million in berkshire debt from default skyrocketed to from  to  why well the simple and honest answer is i have no idea news reports blame bets that buffett made through derivatives on four share markets around the world bets that even if he lost would not require a payout until  but as markets decline some view a loss from these derivatives as more likely even if the finish line is  years away here’s how a bloomberg article described these contracts berkshire shareholders including mohnish pabrai head of pabrai investment funds have said investors are concerned about losses on the company’s  billion bet on world equity values more than a decade from now buffett sold contracts to undisclosed counterparties for  billion protecting the buyers against declines in four stock indexes including the sp  under the agreements berkshire will pay as much as  billion if on specific dates beginning in  the indexes are below the point where they were when he made the agreements by sept  berkshire had written down the contracts by  billion as the sp declined for a fourth straight quarter the fact is that berkshire is down  this year the sp  is down  so am i selling berkshire nope i buy a little more each month just like i invest a little more in various mutual funds in my k but i sure

 stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a

 yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high high this funds expenses are rated as high because they are above the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each
