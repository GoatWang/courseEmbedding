library january   cp letterman auburn ca quality  value  meets expectations  dr john d currid is professor of old testament at reformed theological seminary in charlotte north carolina he has a phd in archaeology and has authored several commentaries eg the pentateuch habakkuk in his introduction dr currid breaks up the book of ruth into five sections part oneã¢â¬âsetting the scene  part twoã¢â¬ânaomi and her moabite daughterinlaws  part threeã¢â¬âin the fields of bethlehem  part fourã¢â¬âthe scene at the threshing floor  and part fiveã¢â¬âredemption  these sections encompass the majority of the commentaries brief  pages also the introduction contains the authors valuable thesis statement thus the book is serving a greater purpose than merely being a moral story of human goodness it points to the future reality of the coming king i would label professor currids commentary somewhere between an exegetical commentary and a devotional one to be clear both elements are beautifully integrated throughout the exegetical component is not only seen in the authors commitment to the literary  historical context but also in his detailed explanation of key words and phrases of each verse as to the devotional feature currid incorporates in each chapter the orthopraxical points to ponder which helps the reader be not just ã¢â¬ëa hearer of the word but also a doer james  for those readers who love reformation history you are in for a treat every chapter is woven with either puritan anecdotes or quotes from the spiritual giants of previous times admittedly dr currids affection for the past may not connect the young or modern reader but what else would you expect from a professor who received his doctorate in archeology the study of old stuff one of the most important concepts of the book of ruth is the goel heb which means literally kinsmanredeemer here dr currid is at his literary best his clear engaging exegesis of this israelite societal provision is eyeopening in just three pages the author describes the four duties of the goel which all revolve around the concept of redemption though most readers will automatically perceive the link to the coming messiah currid leaves no room for blindness and states jesus claims in luke  to be the one who will bring release and liberty to his people he is the goel for the believer p  criticism if you were to ask any pastor or scholar what is the most provocative part of ruth the answer is always the scene of the threshing floor of course this scene is the apex the crescendo of the story ruth by the advice of naomi her motherinlaw dolls herself up and sneaks into the bed of boaz and lies down at his feet provocative indeed dr currid argues strongly that not only was this act culturally appropriate but there was no sexual activity between ruth and boaz he does admit that the term uncover is often used to describe sexual activity in the ot but the connection to boazs feet speaks to redemption not sexual conduct he states on page  ruth ã¢â¬ëis asking that boaz would be willing to take her under his redemptive wings to protect herthe placing of the blanket over her is symbolic of that protection and security though i agree with the authors conclusion i think this issue required direct interaction with those views critical of his of which he did not do finally i continue to be unsettled with the need for ruths nightly encounter with boaz dr currid gives no cultural precedence for such an interaction and his application of ezekiel  though original to this reviewer is not convincing i am left wondering if naomis advice reveals impatience rather than godly discretion conclusion in my opinion this resource is a wonderful addition to the short list of ruthian commentaries currids work is brief readable and from the reformed tradition though it doesnt feel that way if you are just starting to build your library i would start with this work

helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate jimmy reagan leesville sc age  gender male  stars out of  great tool december   jimmy reagan leesville sc age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  would you like a really suggestive commentary on the book of ruth then you simply must pick up ruth from bitter to sweet by john currid and published by ep books in the helpful welwyn commentary series i had heard good things on his genesis exodus leviticus and deuteronomy but somehow had never gotten around to picking them up so i was excited to get this volume on ruth i wasnt disappointed the book is especially helpful for the pastor or bible teacher though it is written in an accessible manner that could benefit anyone the  chapters of ruth are covered in  chapters here that would pretty much be divided along the lines one might want to preach it is not as much a typological commentary as many of the popular volumes on ruth are and though i personally do see real typology in ruth myself this volume is a worthy aid in working through ruth he still writes much of christ and gives much help on the narrative itself he works out details gives exceptionally good help on word meanings without being overly technical and has nice illustrations from scripture and history that really brings the text alive i have all the wellknown volumes on ruth and am glad to let this book take a prominent place beside i think i need to get those other volumes by mr currid too i received this book free from the publisher i was not required to write a positive review the
