aegon nv nyseaeg  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»aegon nv its closing time for this preferred stockmar  about aegon nv aeg arbitrage trader arbitrage debt bonds shortterm horizonmarketplacetrade with betasummaryaeb has reached levels where the upside potential is limited by its fundamentalsfloating rate preferred stocks have had a good year so far but at some point it is wise to cash inthere are other options similar to this product which will provide you with better current yield and have plenty of room before reaching par valuethis article will be rather unusual as we are not going to explore any sort of arbitrage but i will instead try to raise awareness about one particular stock in which it is time to head for the exit the stock the product in question is aegon nv nyseaeg floating rate perpetual capital securities aeb below are some key parameters we should pay attention to nominal yield   or  plus the threemonth libor whichever is greater and the latter is adjusted on a quarterly basis current yield  as of  liquidation price  call price  call date  maturity date none rating baabbb rated  it is eligible for the  tax rate given that this week the libor rating we should be paying attention to is hovering around  it takes no genius to realize investors will not be seeing yield better than the nominal for a while unless something crazy happens that being said anyone not trading actively needs to know that on  this preferred stock traded on par value and there is no reason for it to trade above that in fact if it does continue going up you are going to be exposed to a potential call of the whole issue and the yield does not justify this risk source lightspeed trader aeb  weekly chart i decided to include a chart to further emphasize on the downside risk if you keep holding the stock the movement observed through  was ignited by the rate hike so you can imagine rates are another factor to take into consideration albeit with libor crawling up as well the peer group source the authors database as you can see in the table above there are many other investment opportunities in the floating rate space that provide us with about the same or even better current yield than aeb however one thing to take into consideration is the fact that a majority of them are trading below par what does this mean firstly i doubt that anyone whose investment criteria includes current yield is a fan of libortracking preferred stocks the rates have been so low that all these products have utilized their fixedrate minimum yields for years now and have yet to take libor into account and it is still far below the levels where it will have an actual impact secondly you have to look at the price relative to par if you plan on holding any stock from this group longterm because although it might sound speculative it is wise to consider the possibility of a call all in all anyone who has been following my articles over the last few months is familiar with my approach i do not consider them as an investment vehicle but prefer pair trading them whenever there is a mispricing my past articles on the topic reveal my methodology so you can be prepared in case aeb shrugs off all fundamentals and proceeds going up conclusion i believe anyone who has aegon nv floating rate perpetual capital securities aeb in his portfolio should reap the fruits of his investment and head for the exit as there is limited to no upside potential at this point given the pace at which libor has been moving upward there are a whole bunch of reasons why it is smart to

view them as such their credit rating and yield are simply not compatible and are essentially capped by their call price disclosure i amwe are short aeb i wrote this article myself and it expresses my
