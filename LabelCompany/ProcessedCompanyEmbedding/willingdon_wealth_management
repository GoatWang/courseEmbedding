selecting fixed income securities is primarily on credit quality and cash flow while also providing yield generation we believe that fixed income provides a strong foundation to a balanced portfolio therefore we reduce risk by investing in companies with low default risk taxable bond portfolios are constructed using us treasuries us agency or investment grade corporate bonds we currently favor agencies and corporate bonds due to the low returns offered by us treasuries tax free bond portfolios are constructed using high quality municipal bonds from the state in which the client resides the

but isn’t generating the inflation or growth that would propel rates significantly higher this uncertainty favors wwm’s strategy of using individual bonds interest rates rise and fall however high quality bonds always mature at par our preference remains for high quality bonds with average duration of  years and shorter or structured bonds that have coupons that will float or step up as rates

process we help our clients avoid emotional decisions which most often destroy portfolio value we rely upon our vast experience not to get too fearful when things look bleak and not to get overly optimistic when the economy and markets are rolling by doing this effectively our clients have an excellent probability of reaching their longterm investment goals you mention on the willingdon difference page that your fees are lower than most of your competitors are you doing something different that gives you a competitive edge willingdon primarily uses individual stocks and bonds in our welldiversified portfolios many of our competitors primarily use mutual funds which creates an extra layer of fees mutual funds have internal expense ratios that vary depending on the fund typically averaging about  annually although expenses can be significantly higher this fee is often in addition to the fee firms charge to select funds and manage asset allocation bottom line  the fees for managed mutual fund portfolios are typically about twice as much as willingdons fees and are far less transparent most of our competitors use mutual funds as opposed to individual stocks and bonds because the principals of the firms lack the experience and expertise to manage assets inhouse their expertise is typically in financial planning not money management which is why the asset management function is outsourced through mutual funds creating an extra layer of fees at willingdon we have a significant competitive advantage in that we have the expertise credentials experience  track record to manage assets internally while providing high level financial planning advice moreover our clients build a relationship with the professionals who are actually managing their money i see that the associates at willingdon have several different designations cfa cfp® ctfa cpa what do these designations mean and why are they important at willingdon we have a significant competitive advantage in that we have the expertise credentials experience  track record to build welldiversified portfolios using a more cost effective approach while also providing high level financial planning advice many of our competitors provide one of these functions at the highest level but not both for example the cfp® designation is very important in financial planning but it is not a designation that indicates an ability to manage money many of our competitors have this designation and their firms are built around determining the appropriate asset allocation for a client based on individual risk tolerance and investment objectives but they then hire outside managers mutual funds to pick the individual securities this adds an extra layer of fees for the client to be qualified to build investment portfolios without using mutual funds the cfa designation is critical having both designations is a big advantage for willingdon clients from both an expertise and cost perspective here are more details about each designation cfa chartered financial analyst  a professional designation given by the cfa institute that measures the competence and integrity of financial analysts candidates are required to pass three levels of exams covering areas such as accounting economics ethics money management and security analysis the cfa charter is one of the most respected designations in finance

sections of a rigorous exam including auditing business environment financial accounting and regulation please note that tom searson earned his cpa while working for ernst  young in chicago he does not currently practice as a cpa what is the most significant difference between a broker and a registered investment advisor ria willingdon wealth management is a registered investment advisor ria and is not a broker the most significant difference comes down to fiduciary duty click on the link below to read an article in the wall street journal about this important difference between brokers and rias and then read our response to the article httponlinewsjcomarticlesbhtmlmodrelevancy willingdons thoughts on the subject from a june  edition of willingdon views an industry development and long over due let me first say for the record that some of the nicest people i have known over my  year career in the money management business have been brokers many of them are solid people wonderful parents and active members in their churches and communities with that being said there is an integral part of the broker business model that i have always found to be unsettling specifically it is the lack of fiduciary duty a fiduciary is required by law to place clients best interests ahead of their own brokers are not held to this high standard conversely registered investment advisory firms rias are held to this standard that in my mind has always been the defining difference between brokers and rias i have always been a bit hesitant to write about this being fearful of sounding selfserving willingdon wealth management is an ria thankfully the obama administration and several recent articles in the wall street journal have brought this issue out in the open one component of regulatory reform that president obama is proposing is to create an agency called the consumer financial protection agency whose purpose would include establishing this higher level fiduciary duty for brokers to which rias are currently held why is this important basically each investor has a choice to hire someone who is required by law to put their best interests first an ria or hire someone who is not required to do so a broker why would someone ever hire someone who is not required by law to put their interests first i have no idea in a similar vein any individual who wants to work in the money management business can decide to work as an ria or as a broker im sure you see what the implications of this are and why it makes me uncomfortable to write about it most people detest selfrighteousness and rightly so nevertheless the obama administration has made this a critical part of its proposed financial regulatory reform i do believe it is legitimate and prudent to ask anyone you are considering hiring to manage your assets whether they are a fiduciary but dont stop there if they are ask why if they are not ask why not through this dialogue you might find out something invaluable to your decision process there have been a number of high profile fraud cases with investment firms recently willingdon seems like a good group of people that comes highly recommended but victims of investor fraud often felt the same way about the people they were working with how can i be confident in trusting willingdon will be a good steward of my assets trust is the most important part of the clientadvisor relationship our primary focus is on establishing and strengthening our clients trust in willingdon in light of some recent headlines we understand why some investors confidence is shaken when it comes to selecting a firm to manage their life savings there are some important safeguards we have established to give our clients even more confidence that their assets are being handled with the utmost integrity fidelity is the custodian for our clients accounts willingdon has the authority to make discretionary trades in these accounts however we do not have the authority to transfer assets from our clients accounts to outside parties fidelity holds the assets and generates monthly statements detailing the holdings willingdon makes the investment decisions this checks and balances system is established of for our clients protection does willingdon earn any commission based fees what conflicts of interest exist willingdon cannot accept commissionbased fees we have no incentive to sell any financial products rather we focus solely on selecting securities that provide the best riskadjusted return we are not compensated for trading in any way and therefore strive to keep execution costs to a minimum our interests and our clients interests are perfectly aligned without any conflicts of interest inherent in selling financial products i do not live in north carolina can willingdon manage my investment portfolios willingdon wealth management is a registered investment advisor with the us securities and exchange commission we are not limited by any state boundaries and have clients throughout the country what is the minimum account size to become a willingdon client while our average client has between  and  in investable assets we do not have a strict account minimum we strive to build such strong relationships with our clients in a consistent way that each client regardless of size truly believes they are our most important client because in reality each one is is our core equity portfolio which uses individual stocks as diversified as portfolios using mutual funds our core equity portfolio holds between    individual stocks we maintain exposure to all of the largest sectors in the sp  to maintain prudent diversification and to manage overall portfolio risk portfolios comprised of multiple mutual funds do not enhance the overall diversification compared to our core portfolio in fact there may be unknown overlap within the various mutual funds in a portfolio that actually creates a higher risk less diversified profile
