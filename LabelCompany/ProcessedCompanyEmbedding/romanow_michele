technology success stories opportunity prosper rankings profit  startup  profit w best places for business events p ceo summit home•startup•best practices lessons from the dragons getting it right with product no  a singlesku success story and some inventive ideas in dragons den season  episode  murad hemmadi  november   topics dragons den print email comment share emily rudow second from right and kayla nezon far right of oneiric photo cbc more than a decade in dragons’ den continues to inspire and amuse canadian tv audiences but the cbc’s hit show isn’t just meant to be entertaining it’s a televised school for entrepreneurs for each episode of season  which airs wednesdays at  pm et we’ll be talking to one of the dragons to get a behindthescenes glimpse of their decisionmaking process and hear what they hope viewers learned and we’ll be examining the pitches for smart strategies and useful tips that entrepreneurs can use to make their own businesses better episode  the ‘why didn’t i think of that’ special featured plenty of inventive ideas and two entrepreneurs with a singlesku success story oneiric hockey entrepreneur emily rudow  kayla nezon  from waterloo ont  ask  for  manufactures and distributes children’s hockey apparel a lot of business origin stories follow a familiar pattern see a need come up with a solution to fill that need then build a company around the solution getting product no  right is key says michele romanow “it needs to have such strong productmarket fit that it can carry you for a while” she explains “if your first product is weak you’re never going to get the flywheel going—the initial traction to get you enough customers and revenue to get to growth” emily rudow and kayla nezon had achieved that crucial initial step with the protective baselayer children’s hockey pants they pitched on dragon’s den’s “why didn’t i think of that’ special episode “these girls had found a real need probably spent a touch too much time on product development but had a very good end product” romanow said in an exclusive interview before the episode aired on set she offered  for a  equity stake in oneiric joe mimran also made a bid asking for  of the company and an equal say on decisions manjit minhas made it three offering the capital for a  royalty for five years rudow tried to get the three dragons together but when they demurred the duo shook hands with minhas the idea for oneiric came from rudow’s own frustrations as a bantam hockey player the product speeds up the process of getting dressed for the rink and protects against cuts and bruises to the back of the leg “i think when you walk into a dressing room and one person puts it on i think all the kids are going to go home and say ‘mom i want one of those’” jim treliving said in the den oneiric had amassed  in sales over the three months pretaping with  of that coming from retail and the rest directtoconsumer through tournaments and online the pants retailed at  for the player version and  for the goalie and cost the company just under half that amounts to make not all the dragons liked those numbers though rudow noted she’d been in talks with manufacturers to reduce the fabricating expense “why didn’t you price it according to where you think your cost will be” asked joe mimran “because retail price points do determine whether you’re going to be successful or not” oneiric was positioning itself as a premium product rudow explained for her part romanow wasn’t worried about consumer sticker shock “i would put hockey in the category of babies weddings and pets where people think ‘if it’s  bucks okay if it’s  okay if it’s  okay’’ she says postfilming “it’s largely talking to a priceinsensitive customer” those consumers still expect quality for their money and delivering one is even more important for a singleoffering company like oneiric perfecting what you’re selling—as rudow spent several years doing—is crucial “this is one of the huge problems with startups—if you don’t win the first time it’s almost impossible for you to scale” says romanow once it’s a proven success that initial product can become an impediment as entrepreneurs resist trying anything else “i can’t think of many billiondollar companies that are singlesku products” notes romanow “you ultimately have to move beyond that” but all of that still begins with a single starting product “the first thing you scale on has to be something that customers really want” umbrella station entrepreneur mike mcquaid  from kelowna bc  ask  for  manufactures and distributes a holder for picnic umbrellas mind the unit economics kelowna may be one of the few places in the country where a beach umbrella will spend more time open than in storage but mike mcquaid believed there was a big market for his shadeholder when he entered the den mcquaid had just quit his job to focus on his company full time “my first real production run is about to come off the line” he explained to the dragons still he’d already moved  worth of umbrella stands in  days “i’m really impressed that you went from the beach you developed a prototype and you really have something that’s ready to sell” said michele romanow while the dragons liked the topline figure they were less pleased with the unit economics of the product the umbrella stand was set to retail for  sans the brolly and a  wholesale price and  manufacturing cost left a slim margin for mcquaid who planned to shift manufacturing to china still michael wekerle opened the bidding asking for a  royalty for the  “once you start ramping up sales this product based out of china i’d be surprised if you pay more than  for the whole thing” he told mcquaid manjit minhas also made an offer asking for a  stake in return for her capital “i can help you with the procurement because cost optimization is where the margins are going to be in this” she said suggesting she’d also buy a million pieces branded with the logo for her beer as a promotional gimmick mcquaid took minhas’ deal paint away products entrepreneur kris friesen  marc allen  from langley bc  ask  for  manufactures and distributes painting accessories what’s your plan numbers are usually a challenge for nascent businesses entering the den but the dragons saw some potential in paint away products’ early returns the company had sold some  worth of marc allen’s preservative cases for paint applicators in two weeks at significant margins but they were less impressed by the future prognosis “we want to see this everywhere” kris friesen told them “so we see online as huge we also see it in say in a home depot and big box stores” “that’s not much of a plan” michele romanow shot back the duo hadn’t made any progress towards their other goal—to team up with a national paint company for canadawide distribution—in part because friesen wasn’t working for the company fulltime “if you don’t put time into the company and dedicate your resources how do you expect it to grow” asked manjit minhas but some dragons were willing to bite romanow offered the  for half the company michael wekerle upped the stakes proposing  for a  stake friesen tried to negotiate him down but wek stood firm and the paint away duo ultimately took the deal trinken entrepreneur jerry mcarthur  wendy lloyd  from north vancouver bc ask  for  manufactures and distributes beer accessories prove your worth most cities and towns—not to mention neighbours—frown upon those sauntering down the street with a tallboy in hand trinken’s solution a faux coffee cup lid that clips onto the top of the can and fits on a standard paper cup “originally it was a way to hide a beer but then we started realizing all the other awesome features like keeping it cold” jerry mcarthur explained the company called lolo lids when it pitched the dragons had sold  worth of the product in three months at  a pop mostly during a kickstarter campaign “it’s such a good way to test market validation for your idea” said michele romanow “you don’t have to spend money up front you see if the audience likes it you see if they put their credit card down” mcarthur and partner wendy lloyd saw their lids as an alternative to the logoplastered promotional beer koozie a  billion market “i think there’s a real product” said jim treliving “i could probably buy some right now and take it to another couple of beer companies that we’d deal with” he asked for  in return for half the company beer baroness manjit minhas was also a fan offering the capital for

vintage designer bags to spa treatments she started the company with a couple of friends and earned  on the first day of sales “i knew i had something interesting” michele who studied engineering at queen’s university in kingston ont is a metrics geek rather than a shopping freak but ultimately some of her greatest wins have been about trusting her gut “in the first year we had  left in the bank and we bought a  print ad i thought ‘if no one buys after that i’m in a lot of trouble’ that was enormous we’ve always been gutsy” in the past year alone michele has taken over seven smaller competitors and created an app her newest brainwave is a grocery couponing app called snapsaves “rather than having to redeem a coupon instore when shoppers know that a product is  off they can buy it

too heavily in any one idea jul   cb staff   buytopia and snapsaves cofounder michele romanow sian richards michele romanow cofounder of buytopia and snapsaves and dragons’ den judge argues the secret to innovating is not investing too heavily in any one idea here are her three tips for taking sensible risks without betting the whole company  create projects not businesses “it’s a gentler fall to say “the project didn’t work” rather than “the business failed” some projects need to be abandoned right away but some take a bunch of iterations to get right i was playing with the idea of doing sample boxes and calling tons of vendors to see if we could distribute a sample box for them when we realized that what was really needed was a better mobile couponing vendor so that’s how we created snapsaves trying little projects and seeing what happens is really important” with inboxes overloaded smart marketers look beyond email  build a lowcost trial “can you build a landing page to test if people are excited by a new idea can you get out a really basic software product without investing too much the nice part about technology is that ideas can be tried very quickly”  call your competitors “when entrepreneurs are testing new ideas they can become obsessed with their market research but you really just need to get the basics talk to people who have worked in that space and find out what works people are always scared to talk to their competitors but asking people “is this sector growing what are you struggling with” gives you a ton of data if there’s no one doing a particular business it’s probably not because nobody has tried it it’s probably because no one has succeeded in it” dragon’s den season  premieres on cbc oct  more about innovation how to mentor a

dragon in the den and serial entrepreneur herself has a message for aspiring founders don’t wait jun   joanna pachner   michele romanow portrait by raina  wilson “please help yourself” michele romanow cries seeing me eye the coffee table overflowing with swag it’s the first day of taping season  of dragons’ den and food was a prominent theme samples of exotic trail mix and a box of sweets on demand peek out from under a pair of bright blue spandex pants from a pitch for a “soccer lifestyle brand” now  hours into a day that started at  am with two hours of makeup and hair fluffing she’s finally kicking back in her dressing room onair black leather pants swapped for jeans and a tshirt tired ha even in downtime mode the woman radiates energy her thoughts flowing out in rapid breathless streams that occasionally end in “does that make sense” more dragons’ den stars the rise and fall and rise of michael wekerle manjit minhas is the biggest beer baron you’ve never heard of—yet at  romanow is the youngest dragon ever and she’s made youthful vitality something of a trademark bubbly thought her business partner anatoliy melnichuk when he first met her at queen’s university—and he didn’t know the half of it yet she’s launched four businesses three of them with the same two partners but that doesn’t really sum up her entrepreneurial knowledge on her fourth day of shooting last season the show’s producers approached her warily to ask if she was getting notes from the presenting entrepreneurs because she knew a surprising amount about each industry “no” she told them “i’ve tried to start half of these businesses” biodegradable packaging bespoke suits made overseas subscription beauty boxes and hundreds of other ideas—romanow and her partners brainstormed researched and started or rejected them all “for every business we tried that people might know there were five that didn’t work” she says in  she left the best known of those businesses torontobased daily deals website buytopia to join groupon after it bought her buytopia spinoff now romanow is getting ready to start her fifth business in fintech she knows little about financial services but then she also knew nothing about running a café making caviar managing websites or peddling rebates when she pressed on with previous startups that’s one thing to know about romanow she has unshakable confidence—no certainty—that she can figure out anything she admits to having something to prove “i don’t know where i get that from” she muses fiddling with a blingy earring left over from her den outfit “maybe thinking i’d never be as successful as my dad” that would be marvin romanow the former ceo of oilpatch giant nexen her worries seem unfounded over the past decade she’s learned that success demands refusing rejection and not waiting for permission “michele is a person who skips the line” says nicole verkindt founder of online aerospace marketplace omx and one of romanow’s best friends “‘no’—she doesn’t even hear the word” start something anything this persistence was evident at an early age in grade  romanow felt her bedtime was too early so her parents encouraged her to survey her classmates for comparison “the results showed that her bedtime was dead last but despite the evidence she still argued she should go to bed later” her dad recalls the first of four kids romanow was born in calgary and then moved to regina but spent a lot of time on her extended family’s farms the experience taught her that no task was beneath her her motto “successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do” an academic high achiever she studied civil engineering at queen’s but within a year knew it wouldn’t be her career at  she decided to open a zerowaste café on campus and entered business plan competitions to raise funds she didn’t win but melnichuk a fellow engineering student saw her pitch and pulled her aside “next year we can beat these guys” he said her first thought what do you mean we how tonia jahshan built steeped tea into a huge retail empire she opened the tea room in her fourth year and  years later it’s still run by the student government at queen’s meanwhile melnichuk introduced romanow to ryan marien “the smartest guy in engineering and chemistry” who also had a knack for analyzing business models but melnichuk who did doortodoor sales as a kid is the one who taught the partners to be deaf to “no” “if you’re afraid of someone saying no you won’t try” marien says melnichuk had another quality romanow needed he was an ultrahigh risk taker while she struggled to find that gutsiness early on the trio spent most nights brainstorming business ideas and then coldcalling companies saying they were students doing a research project “part of the benefit of starting so young was that we believed we could learn anything” says romanow some ideas subscription cosmetics were a poor fit with the canadian market and others financing home upgrades demanded more capital than three yearolds could rustle up one day someone suggested growing trees for expensive furniture “if we’re going to farm anything it’s gotta be the most expensive product in the world” melnichuk retorted that was enough to send them off researching the caviar market they discovered the world supply had plunged by  due to sturgeon overfishing they read every study on fish farming and travelled to meet with sturgeon researchers romanow informed her parents that she couldn’t come home for thanksgiving because she was flying to san francisco to visit a sturgeon farm after six months they had a comprehensive tab excel spreadsheet and entered numerous business plan competitions in north america by year’s end they had collected  the three of them packed into marien’s toyota camry and drove to tiny evandale nb which had one of the few remaining natural supplies of atlantic sturgeon they knew that five local fishermen all retired had licences to catch sturgeon and found one who agreed to rent it to them now they had to find a working fisherman “you should get ted” they were told “just go up the street left at the lights and he’s in the white house” romanow sat by the door for  hours waiting for the guy to get home “i thought i did an engineering degree i did an mba and i’m literally stalking a fisherman right now” to get evandale caviar a sustainable sturgeon aquaculture facility off the ground they lived in a hotel and learned how to process fish and make caviar themselves in the evenings they called highend restaurants and hotels to sell their wares after the summer fishing season they sold most of their inventory before october—october  that is the world of luxury retail collapsed new export legislation hammered the final nail in evandale’s coffin nevertheless romanow sees evandale as a huge personal success “i don’t think i could ever do that again but the fact that i did it was so powerful” from left buytopia cofounders anatoliy melnichuk michele romanow and ryan marien michele romanow ignore the naysayers with the recession in full swing the partners took a hiatus and romanow snagged a job as director of strategy at sears canada the plodding corporate environment was a big contrast to the lightning speed of a startup still romanow was part of an internal consulting group and inhaled every piece of research that came across her desk during a gettogether with melnichuk and marien she told them about the explosion in group buying with companies like chicagobased groupon giving merchants a lowcost way to connect with consumers who received deep discounts none of them had technology skills but they saw an opportunity—if they moved fast with no time for meticulous planning they threw together a strategy “we would have a famous person tweet for us we’d outsource the website overseas and we’d launch at a trade show” romanow says “that was it pathetic” buytopia’s launch at the national women’s show in late  was a shambles the firm they had hired to build the website missed the deadline so they just put up a jpeg of the site’s layout and pasted a “buy” button overtop a paypal interface nevertheless their first three deals brought in  getting that early customer response was crucial which is something romanow believes many entrepreneurs still underestimate “to have real people swipe their credit cards is so much more valuable than combining  vcs’ notes” she says “if you can do lowcost trials of an idea let the market tell you if it’s good” entrepreneurial mbas get a degree and start a business simultaneously the market was challenging groupon’s rise had fed a massive wave of metoo businesses and buytopia was a late arrival “if i had come on dragons’ den i wouldn’t have given myself money” says romanow indeed no investor did they used leftover funds from the caviar firm and pooled their own money to bootstrap buytopia which managed to sign a deal with sears that put it on the map and led to contracts with cirque du soleil and staples “we got all these national brands that probably should have worked with groupon because we were persistent and we got there first” says romanow by the second year buytopia went on a shopping spree and bought six competitors the partners tried to build relationships with their rivals while closely tracking the competition’s traffic and sales data “as people started to exit we were the first phone call they made” says romanow by the end of  consolidation had shrunk canada’s daily deal arena to a few dozen sites and with  million subscribers and  million in sales buytopia was one of the largest but it was a complex business involving operations in sales technology content creation email marketing customer service financing and ecommerce for the first two years the partners didn’t pay themselves romanow worried about turning off her cellphone at night recalling the stress of those days her tone goes quiet as if she’s remembering a trauma “every day i was scared you’re a day away from bankruptcy markets are shifting very quickly and at any moment this could all fall apart and i will have been the hardestworking person of all my friends and missed every birthday party neglected my body and destroyed my personal relationships and i will be left here with nothing” in those turbulent years romanow tried to surround herself with entrepreneurs she started jogging with verkindt and those runs became therapy sessions in which they shared their deepest fears “when you want to believe that things with low probability will happen you have to be around people who have succeeded in that” romanow says “otherwise you’ll have rational people every day tell you all the reasons it will fail and you’ll start to believe them” the closeness among the partners made a big difference rather than split up the leadership functions they tackled priorities together and traded off if one wasn’t making progress they often disagreed but the rule was that if two voted one way that was it and they moved on “if you were listening to our conversation you’d think it was a brutal fight but it was just us debating” says melnichuk most important they helped one another through crises the experience gave them a benchmark for measuring adversity when things seemed bleak later they looked back on buytopia’s early days and thought we’ve been through far worse know when to exit even as they laboured to grow buytopia the partners continued to develop new ideas “we never called them ‘new businesses’ we called them ‘projects’” says romanow “by the time you say you’re starting a business it feels too big to fail” one such project was online scheduling software called cleverfox which stemmed from buytopia’s experience with merchants who struggled to track customer appointments they built it and released it but it didn’t take jim treliving on how to get along with your business partner another venture was a mobile couponing app that allowed consumers to earn grocery rebates by photographing and emailing their receipts on selected products it essentially bypassed retailers and connected buytopia’s subscribers with packaged goods companies the app launched in august  and shoppers took to it immediately but consumer products giants have long sales cycles and weren’t keen on working with a startup the partners realized that to get snapsaves going they needed to gain traction in the bigger us market cracking it would be expensive and they’d need capital so they travelled to silicon valley and boston for meetings with investors and potential partners they scored term sheets from three vc firms when groupon asked to meet the trio expected a courtship but instead got a hazing there were  people around the table all asking questions when eric lefkofsky groupon’s cofounder and then ceo interrupted “listen when the market changes and the retailers are pissed off that you disrupted the space what are you gonna do” the memory makes melnichuk chuckle “eric made me run the gauntlet trying to see how much shit i could take and if i could break” he says “after that meeting we thought this is done eric hates it” but as the team flew home lefkofksy gave his lieutenants an order “buy the company” groupon with  million active customers would give snapsaves immediate scale and credibility in an arena already full of rivals “if we raised money we’d be starting from scratch” says melnichuk the deal closed in june  and groupon relaunched the app in the us as snap by groupon a few months later melnichuk and romanow moved to chicago to work as snap heads of sales and marketing respectively and severed active ties with buytopia to avoid competitive conflicts of interest marien stayed in toronto and remains buytopia’s ceo suddenly romanow found herself back in a corporate environment “there was definitely a biggercompany mentality things took longer and there was more risk aversion” she says but while snap was one of groupon’s most successful launches it soon became apparent it was the wrong fit with the american coupon culture people were looking for deals from retailers not the manufacturer coupons for which the app was designed six months in groupon pivoted the app to focus on retailers romanow insists that was fine by her “there was no part of me that was upset—you want your product to succeed and evolve” melnichuk and romanow were required to remain at groupon for a year they stayed for a year and a half romanow says she never envisioned a longterm commitment to the company “groupon isn’t mine to build” besides she was already involved in something that was calling her back home take another risk when romanow joined dragons’ den last season she was the youthful sparkplug the most approachable of the quintet her everpresent moleskine notebook in her lap she looked like a student taking notes in class and was sometimes shouted over and patronized by the older men on the panel then came the gourmet poutinerie episode romanow was explaining why the entrepreneur’s ownership structure was untenable when jim treliving the restaurant franchise master tapped her arm “hold it sweetie” he said “don’t call me sweetie” she snapped after a frosty tense pause she resumed her lecture meet canada’s nextgeneration billionaire movers and shakers it made for good tv twitter loved it romanow’s sister jackie even offered to put the retort on tshirts but the incident highlighted the downside of romanow’s businessprodigy image her youth combined with a diminutive girlish demeanour can also be a hurdle “there’s definitely an old school–new school dynamic with me and jim” romanow says but on the show she tries to keep her ego in check and insists on giving the entrepreneurs a genuine shot “i’m not going to be the asshole i was most recently on the other side walking into vc meetings scared out of my mind when we start interrupting people in the first two minutes and throw them off their game that doesn’t bring out the best in them” she says “i remember what it was like to take those risks” she’s about to take those risks again romanow won’t reveal much about her new venture other than to say “i’m passionate about the future of work and fintech” she figures she’s seasoned enough to raise her odds of success “my ratio before was one in five now it’s maybe one in four” she laughs but no matter how high the odds she passionately urges entrepreneurs to try—and try young before a mortgage and kids tie them down you don’t need an mba romanow insists you need a gsd—the “get shit done” degree “the worst piece of advice young people get is ‘do this one day but for now you need two years in this job or it will look bad on your resumé’” she says “you’re not building your life for resumé readers just get going you’ll figure it out” is canada finally developing a sustainable startup ecosystem more about entrepreneurs  leadership why big
