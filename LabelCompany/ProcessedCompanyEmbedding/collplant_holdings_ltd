on an assumed initial public offering price of  per ads which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters option to purchase additional adss in this offering is exercised in full we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately  million based on an assumed offering price of  per ads which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for • conducting research and development activities in order to conduct additional clinical trials expand our pipeline of product candidates and pursue additional indications for our existing product candidates estimated at approximately  million • the scaleup of our manufacturing capabilities estimated at approximately  million • the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities for the european market estimated at approximately  million and • the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes including funding the costs of operating as a public company in the united states and israel these expected uses of net proceeds from this offering represent our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors including the progress of our development and commercialization efforts the status of and results from our clinical trials and preclinical studies whether or not we enter into strategic collaborations or partnerships the amount of cash available from other sources and our operating costs and expenditures accordingly our management will have significant flexibility and broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering we expect proceeds from this offering to meet our capital requirements for at least the next three years the proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient to achieve any additional marketing approval of our product candidates we will need substantial additional capital in order to independently pursue fda or other regulatory approvals of any of our product candidates the ability to pursue further regulatory approvals of our product candidates will be dependent upon among other things our ability to enter into partnerships and collaborations to execute additional financings and to generate net income from our operations pending these uses we intend to invest the net proceeds in lowrisk highquality investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government or other governments or hold as cash we have no current commitments or binding agreements with respect to any material acquisition of or investment in any technologies products or companies other than our own plans and business we are not aware of any competitors that produce human collagen from plants or that produce recombinant type i human collagen however our industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition and our rhcollagenbased product candidates will compete with several alternative tissuederived or synthetic products adequate protection of intellectual property successful product development adequate funding and retention of skilled experienced and professional personnel are among the many factors critical to success in the pharmaceutical industry generally our competitors currently include large fully integrated companies as well as academic research institutes and companies in various developmental stages that develop alternative sources and forms of collagen and tissuederived products our vergenixstr product candidate will compete with companies that sell steroid injections and prp kits including biomet inc arthrex inc harvest technologies corporation mtf sports medicine and arteriocyte medical systems inc the primary competitors to our vergenixfg product candidate are products based on tissuederived collagens manufacturers of these products include among others integra lifesciences corporation wright medical technology inc smith  nephew molnlycke convatec coloplast and urgo the collplant surgical matrix will compete primarily with medtronic incs infuse bone graft product which combines a recombinant bone growth protein and bovinebased collagen nuvasive incs osteocel a cellular bone matrix product and othrofixs trinity elite allograft product company description we are a clinicalstage regenerative medicine company focused on developing and commercializing tissue repair products initially for the orthobiologics and advanced wound care markets our product candidates are based on our rhcollagen a form of human collagen produced with our proprietary plantbased genetic engineering technology we believe our technology is the only commercially viable technology available for the production of genetically engineered or recombinant human collagen we believe that our rhcollagen which is identical to the type i collagen produced by the human body has significant advantages compared to currently marketed tissuederived collagens including improved biofunctionality superior homogeneity and reduced risk of immune response we believe the attributes of our rhcollagen make it suitable for numerous tissue repair applications in orthobiologics and advanced wound care throughout the human body orthobiologics use cellbased therapies and biomaterials to promote healing advanced wound care is composed of biocompatible products that are intended to actively promote wound healing by interacting either directly or indirectly with wound tissues we believe that the annual market opportunity for our current product candidates utilizing our rhcollagen within the orthobiologics and advanced wound care markets exceeds  billion we have not generated any material revenue from product sales to date we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in  and have an accumulated deficit of  million as of september   our recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and as a result our independent registered public accounting firm has noted this in the opinion they issued on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may never be profitable our vergenixstr product candidate is a soft tissue repair matrix which combines crosslinked rhcollagen with plateletrich plasma or prp and is intended to accelerate healing in the treatment of tendinopathy in august  we completed an open label single arm multicenter clinical trial of vergenixstr in israel in october  we received ce marking certification for vergenixstr which is required for a product to be marketed in the european union in november  we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with arthrex gmbh in munich germany an affiliate of arthrex inc for vergenixstr covering europe the middle east india and certain african countries our vergenixfg product candidate is a woundfilling flowable gel made from our rhcollagen intended to enhance the quality and speed of closure of deep surgical incisions and wounds including diabetic ulcers burns bedsores and other chronic wounds we completed an open label single arm multicenter clinical trial of vergenixfg in israel to support ce marking certification in february  we received ce marking certification for vergenixfg and in july  we supplied our first order in europe to bring our initial two product candidates to market we intend to first commercialize the product candidates in europe and expect to pursue us food and drug administration or fda approval under the premarket approval or pma regulatory pathway for our rhcollagenbased products we are developing a bone graft surgical matrix which we refer to as the collplant surgical matrix in collaboration with bioventus llc or bioventus a global leader in active orthopedic healing the collplant surgical matrix is a novel resorbable carrier composed of rhcollagen and synthetic minerals which is intended to be charged with a bone morphogenic protein or bmp developed by bioventus for use as a bone graft substitute in bone repair indications such as spinal fusion and trauma the collplant surgical matrix charged with a bmp which we refer to as the bioventus product candidate is intended to stimulate the recruitment and differentiation of boneforming cells which can heal existing bone and produce new natural bone we are party to a nonbinding term sheet entered into on july   with bioventus for the license and supply of the collplant surgical matrix in anticipation of filing an investigational new drug application or ind bioventus is undertaking preclinical animal studies comparing the collplant surgical matrix to other active comparators while negotiations for a binding license and supply agreement are ongoing no license and supply agreement has been entered into and there can be no assurance that we will enter into any definitive agreement with bioventus our rhcollagen has superior biological function when compared to any tissuederived collagens whether from animal or human tissues according to data published in peerreviewed scientific publications our rhcollagen can be fabricated in different forms shapes and viscosities including gels pastes sponges sheets membranes fibers and thin coats all of which have been tested in vitro and in animal models and proven superior to tissuederived products these different forms of our rhcollagen broaden the potential applications of our products for example collagen gels made of our rhcollagen are more homogenous and less viscous compared to tissuederived collagens making the rhcollagen gels ideal for any injectable product we have demonstrated that due to its homogeneity rhcollagen can produce fibers and membranes with high molecular order meaning all the molecules are oriented in the same direction which enables the formation of tissue repair products with distinctive physical properties including improved tensile strength due to the alignment of the collagen fibers higher levels of transparency and the ability to achieve high concentrations of collagen at low viscosities the unique properties of our rhcollagen make it an ideal building block for many products such as bioinks for d printing artificial tendons and transparent ophthalmic products that we believe cannot currently be produced using tissuederived collagens the production of our rhcollagen begins when five human genes essential for the production of collagen are introduced into a tobacco plant the genetically engineered tobacco plantlets are distributed to qualified greenhouses across israel where they are grown to maturity which takes about eight weeks the tobacco leaves are then harvested and processed to an extract which undergoes purification until the final rhcollagen product is produced costeffective production the abundant supply of raw materials and the resulting product pristine human collagen are the most important features of plantbased production we are advancing a new production process that we believe will result in higher yields and labor cost reductions assuring adequate supply as demand for rhcollagen increases  we

contact search for wound care the global market for wound care encompasses traditional dressings and bandages as well as advanced wound care products such as bioengineered skin and skin substitutes and wound care growth factors over the past  years there has been a shift from traditional wound dressings towards advanced therapies that aim to optimize the wound healing environment advanced wound care is composed of biocompatible products that are intended to actively promote wound healing by interacting either directly or indirectly with wound tissues attempts to reduce the duration of hospital stays in order to limit healthcare costs and the goal of enhancing therapeutic outcomes are driving the demand for advanced wound care and closure products one of the primary market drivers for advanced wound care products is the increasing incidence of chronic wounds which are on the rise due to an aging population and a sharp rise in the incidence of diabetes and obesity worldwide both advanced age and chronic medical conditions are associated with a slower healing process and all phases of wound healing are affected the inflammatory response is decreased or delayed as is the proliferative response espicom estimates that the global market for advanced wound care in  had reached  billion representing a growth rate of approximately  since  with a wide range of dressings to choose from dressing selection is a significant challenge for wound care clinicians the ideal dressing should induce rapid healing at reasonable cost with minimal inconvenience to the patient in a healing wound a cascade of events occurs that includes platelet accumulation inflammation fibroblast proliferation cell contraction angiogenesis and re epithelization ultimately leading to scar formation and wound remodeling collagen plays an important role in each of these phases of wound healing native intact collagen provides a natural scaffold or substrate for new tissue growth dressings containing collagen are thought to provide the wound with an alternative collagen source that is degraded over time leaving the endogenous native collagen to continue normal wound healing advanced wound dressings have the benefit of forming part of the natural tissue matrix and some of them play an important role in natural wound healing and new tissue formation these characteristics make them the most attractive and fastest growing segment of the overall advanced wound care market experiencing double digit growth in  in certain instances these matrices are incorporated with compounds such as growth factors and antimicrobials for delivery to the wound site there are a number of advanced wound care dressings available that incorporate tissue derived collagen to enhance wound bed
