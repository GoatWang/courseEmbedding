underscores an artistic exploration that delves deep into the history of commercial art stereotypes which during the late th and early th centuries relegated african americans to graphic ghettos comprised of sambos mammies minstrels and coons charles argues that the once ubiquitous existence of these characters are virtually unknown to blacks he believes that graphic depictions of infantile shiftless and baffoonish black men and women are artifacts that shed needed light on the conflict the black people have in society today as both a reminder and as a way to coopt these negative portrayals charles  years old a painter and professor at the the university of texas at austin recasts ugly stereotypes in huge satiric paintings that challenge the language of institutional racism the messages he conveys through his art however are not always welcome “a lot of blacks don’t want to see images like mine perhaps they bring up too much pain” asserts charles “a lot of whites are embarrassed and feel ashamed by them  but out of sight out of mind doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist it happened and i feel it has not been dealt with” charles is a strictly representational painter whose early work addressed political and social issues with homage to such th century commentators as goya and daumier but without their rapier wit however with his most recent paintings of racial stereotypes found in vintage commercial art — which he began painting in  and continue through his most recent exhibition at the tony shafrazi gallery in new york — he uses wit and irony to attack both the racism of the past and present his paintings are rendered in a primative style and he quotes vintage circus banners vernacular signs and folk paintings a pastiche that underscores the fact that these disturbing images were once was america’s most popular art critics have attacked the artist for resurrecting images that were long ago hidden from view ignored by historians as a sad chapter in the continuum of a burgeoning nation but charles argues that the issues raised by these images continue to haunt society albeit through different contemporary stereotypes of ganstas rappers even characters on blackoriented tv sitcoms subjugation through imagery is something that is never totally expunged and charles wants to make certain that people understand the power that these had over peoples’ perceptions as a child charles may have seen the remnants of vintage imagery that was still around his native louisiana but he did not think much of them — then “when i was in graduate school however a colleague of mine gave me a little sambo figurine” he relates “at the time i was doing paintings about the american flag so i didn’t use these stereotypes initially — i didn’t think it was what i was searching for however since i began to use such images i feel i will never view life in the same way ” through reprises of these dubious icons of “negro” america charles asserts that the roots of current stereotypes can be traced back to the history of disenfranchised blacks but his art is also a form of selfexploration “i want to know about these images — how they were used why they were used and when they are being used” he says “but there’s more to my work than just black face image or the clown caricature i am deeply motivated by various forms of communication” common black stereotypes have changed from the poor shiftless fieldhand to mighty supermen atheletes earning milliondollar contracts and charles’ visual archeology has helped him see how these vintage images are reconciled and revised “i see images of the black basketball player everywhere i know it’s a hot fad but i remember watching the olympics when the first dream team was assembled oh boy did america jump on the backs of those atheletes… but ultimately how does it effect the conditions of blacks” he asks himself and that is the rhetorical question present in all his work the mammy particularly in the image of aunt jemima who continues to grace the package of her namesake product is one of the characters that charles singles out for scrutiny this is because in the history of stereotypes the desexualization of black people was deliberate and the mammy — the caring house servant who often raised the white man’s children — was the most desexualized of all charles portrays her in his work as kind of heroine in a stunning parody of norman rockwell’s rosie the riveter aunt jemima sits regally to suggest her unacknowledged contributions to white and black america the saturday evening post never showed a black woman in an heroic light if at all at the same time his ironic portrayals of mammy are harsh critiques of her diminuation in mainstream popular art charles regards the way that mammies and other black types were portrayed in art was a wanton attempt to make them unthreatening to whites “i think they had to remain childlike overweight lazy and unintelligent” he explains  “for whites to remind themselves of who they were” the minstrel show is another target these musical entertainments popular during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and comprised of whites putting on black face and cavorting on stage were as well attended as the ethnic vaudeville shows minstrelry was the white’s attempt to mimmick and make fun of blacks and a way of experiencing otherness at a safe distance some historians have argued that the essence of black people was stolen on the contrary charles insists that “it cannot be stolen the essence of blackness for me is defined as being able to withstand to evolve to grow inspite of to show one’s wounds to wear one’s scars and get right back up because there is nothing else left to do ” one wonders how african american’s viewed themselves as a result of the national ad campaigns and comic sections that routinely used these stereotypes did the bombardment of these stereotypes have an indelible impact on selfesteem charles believes that not only did the images influence blacks’ interpretations of themselves “they continue to influence whites asian european african and many other cultures’ perceptions of american blacks and how they see themselves these images are forever part of the vocabulary of what one should want and what one should not want ” yet given charles’ best intentions to educate blacks and whites through exposure to these images and his commentaries about them he says that he has received mixed responses “one woman onced asked me ‘how does it feel to be the clarence thomas of the art world’” he relates “she believed that clarence thomas was a sellout and by association giving me the same title she said that i was selling out too she had a very limited perspective i am an individual who happens to be black the fact that i am black does not mean that i represent or support every black cause” in fact she is not alone in feeling that introducing these images which took many generations to forget does more harm that good “her comments initially  bothered me” continues charles “but ultimately i found it more humorous than anything i don’t know maybe she saw a part of herself in one of my paintings” nevertheless charles is disturbed that people cannot see the symbolic intent of his work and only fixate on the surface meaning “i had a journalist walk up to me and say ‘so tell me about the black woman in this painting’ i responded by saying that it’s not a black woman it’s an image that i use to refer to a black woman i don’t think she was able to separate the caricature image of a black person from the reality of knowing what a black person actually is” through these paintings charles is also attempting to understand when and if perceptions among whites towards blacks began to change for the better “it’s evident that some white peoples’ perceptions about blacks have never changed” he says about his conclusions “this process of change has been a gradual thing that is consistently gaining and losing ground” one of the changes that have occured since the black power and black is beautiful consciousness raising days of the s is indeed the notions of ugliness and beauty after one of charles’ openings a showing of paintings that included critiques of little black sambo the perennial children’s story originally an east indian folktale of a little african boy’s travails with a tiger he tells of an elderly white woman who came up to him and said “‘please don’t make the sambo ugly i love little sambo i grew up with the sambo it’s so dear to me’” as she started to cry charles was struck by how much she had invested in a the fictional character “she went on to say that she’s not racist” charles continues “that her children grew up around black people they had black people over all the time and she worked in a school in which she taught black students she began making a cradling gesture as if she was holding a little baby” but charles concluded that “she didn’t get it” she did not see his painted interpretation of sambo as anything but a black person rather than a representation of attitudes “that instance is one of the things that really motivates me to continue my exploration into these images and how they effect us ” michael ray charles’ paintings are tours de force that are formalist masterworks and discomforting messages he understands the difficult line he’s toeing by reprising such charged images yet he insists that they deserve a certain respect that comes from more scrutiny “i think about so many people whose lives these images have affected a lot of black people have died and many are dying under the weight of these images that’s motivation enough for me to explore and deal with these things”  thoughts on “michael ray charles when racist art was commercial art” p april   at  pm it’s one thing to talk about the holocaust and not forget about injustice that happend in the past but that is not the same as bringing back old images that are degrading why re create offensive caricatyres and nuture those stupid images on peoples mind i don’t see the meaning of that when jewish people let the whole world not forget about the racism that they met the holocoust – they does not use old stupid negativ images of themself when they talk about what happend not like this without any context it’s very contaproductive and opposite of going forward to something new i think bill cosby brought more change with the cosby show to white peoples mind than someone bringing up all those negative images

art history inspiration politics michael ray charles and me mr charles michael ray charles is an artist i have admired for years and is without a doubt my favorite living artist his work is very controversial due to his honest treatment of racial issues and his confrontational style i was introduced to his work by one of my art school professors charles’ name was on a list of contemporary artists the class was assigned to research in order to “broaden our horizons”  as soon as i saw his paintings i knew some version of that was what i wanted to do charles’ colorful graphically styled paintings draw upon the rich vein of historical racial stereotyping running through american advertising product packaging billboards radio jingles and television commercials charles relates the little black sambo mammy and minstrel images of a bygone era to contemporary massmedia portrayals of black youths celebrities and athletes charles feels such imagery is deeply ingrained in the american subconscious  i for one agree circus “stereotypes have evolved” he notes “i’m trying to deal with present and past stereotypes in the context of today’s society” twisted caricatures of africanamerican experience such as aunt jemima are represented in charles’s work as ordinary depictions of blackness yet are stripped of the aura of harmlessness that lends them an appearance of truth that is very seldom questioned people just don’t stop to think about where these images come from charles says “aunt jemima is just an image but it almost automatically becomes a real person for many people in their minds but there’s a difference between these images and real humans” in each of his paintings notions of beauty ugliness nostalgia and violence emerge and converge reminding us that we can’t easily divorce ourselves from a past that has led us to where we are who we have become and how we are portrayed his work furthermore examines how african americans have been viewed in american history and also how we have come to view ourselves as a result of demeaning stereotypes his paintings have a scraped antique look to resemble peeling vintage commercial art with these he presents his own satirical campaign for a fictitious product called forever free this product symbolizes the false promises of freedom made to blacks by america and also by the consumer market through their false images beware charles’ forceful and aggressive use of racial stereotypes has often been at the center of controversy in a  artnews  article charles explained “every time i have a show there are some black folks complaining”  obviously his blunt approach to his artwork tells us he wants to draw strong reactions from you and me the viewer  while he’s been criticized for daring to take this approach some have applauded charles for boldly questioning the status quo for example director spike lee has described charles’ work as “cinematic his works are onesheets posters for movies that hollywood would never have the nerve to make exploring race and sex in this country”   please comment below let me hear what you think   sign – up for my free biweekly newsletter   mondays got you down

e neoslapstick fox network sitcom in living color lies t h e ironic sensibility and of the exhibition michael ray charles an american artist   shown last year at t h e contemporary a r t center cac in cincinnati the bruising visual discourse presented by charles explores t h e often inponderable i s sues and questions of our culture that circulate around racial stereotypes  with his neoexpressionist manner of painting and verbal m a nipulation charles constantly reinvents and reconfigures negative advertising stereotypes of african american characters and destroys their original debasement  his well painted scandalous broadsides are staged in a vibrant and sardonic visual language which challenges the viewer charless disturbing manipulations of racial images and stereotypes follows in t h e manner of s us representative to the venice biennale robert colescott for much of his career colescott has unstintingly appropriated icons of t h e western canon and turned them on their head and like colescottand kara walker charles revels in t h e explosive intercultural subtext of identity and negative stereotypes interracial sex and racebased icons i t is charless interrogation and subversion of sambos mammies and sportscelebrity icons which move these paintings thematic thrust onto theirtroubling turf the format charles employs is that of an enlarged advertising banner in which a retinue of little black sambos aunt j e m i m a s  pickaninnies negro court jesters celebrities sports icons and black face circus animals in harlequin pants make their

whether it is second generation appropriation whose use value is premised on its ordinary shock value and lack of critical dimension whatever one brothers permanently daily circus mixed makes of these

artworks biography auction results dealers events filter sort × biography michael ray charles is a contemporary american painter his work explores historic african american stereotypes from the antebellum south appropriating images from advertising and pop culture to expose the underlying racism prevalent in contemporary culture charles creates a mimetic vocabulary of cultural racial and historicized images to subvert those themes and explore surviving caricatures that continue to appear in popular media such as aunt jemima or sambo “stereotypes have evolved i’m trying to deal with present and past stereotypes in the context of today’s society” the artist has said born in lafayette la in  he went on to earn his bfa from mcneese state university and his mfa from the university of houston his work has been both critically celebrated and the source of controversy and in  charles was the subject of an art short documentary he was appointed as the hugh roy and lillie cranz cullen distinguished professor of painting in  at the university of houstons school of art and he has exhibited internationally notably in the austin museum of art the knox art gallery and the museum of
