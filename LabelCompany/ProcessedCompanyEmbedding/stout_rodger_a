victorian a cute year old italianate victorian had the potential to be a stunning garden house  but only after taming the garden adding style to the porches and applying some unexpected new colors a shot of the house from when it was abandoned in the s when we bought the house the exterior wasnt in the best of condition the landscaping lacked structure the porches were anything but welcoming and the fussy paint scheme was overly busy and yet still boring the garage had been built many years after the house yet shared the dull colors the driveway wasnot good rather than continue with a multicolor paint scheme we opted to paint the entire house in sherwinwilliams inkwell trimwork and corbel details were highlighted not with a different color but with a different higher sheen to make the simple front walk more memorable we built a wood boardwalk that we painted to match the house our modernist wood gate lends a more formal garden house feel and helps keep buck the dog from wandering roger created the feel of an english garden by dramatically cutting back the hedge on one side of the house and cultivating a matching hedge on the other side the transformed home features dramatic color tailored landscaping and distinctive touches like planter boxes and bold pink doors we built planter boxes and added huge boxwoods to add an english touch to the porch the back porch features a charming container garden perfect for days when we keep the french doors open in the kitchen we dyed a white butterfly chair cover to match our color theme the backyard is a mixture of wilderness and whimsy with rogers polka dot painted eames chair sitting amidst wildflowers photo by alec hemer the finished modern gate and boardwalk create a more formal entrance we made drapes for the porch to add a whimsical touch the fabric is an allweather fade proof textile chris sewed them to length and added black plastic grommets the drapery rods were improvised from galvanized pipe fittings with end caps large enough to prevent the drapes from blowing off they are tied back to the pillars using eye hooks and black paracord the previously pinkygray garage  with vinyl siding and aluminum garage doors  looks far more sophisticated in its darker hue a new driveway stained steps and wildflower garden surrounding it add polish and charm the path along the side to the backyard is

of course good design isnt ephemeral the trendy the instyleoneminute outthenext the destinedtobedated while there are plenty of pieces of furniture that look great today finding objects that will look great tomorrow the day after tomorrow and beyond is trickier we believe that good design — great design — sticks around it continues to feel modern and fresh even as more temporal styles fade weve searched through hundreds of years worth of styles to handpick designs from the past and present we believe to be timeless and enduring style without sacrifice the unpleasant secret of many distinctive furniture styles — whether traditional modern or somewhere in between — is that many of them just arent comfortable for instance classic chesterfield sofas may bring tremendous style and presence into a room but they also bring aches and pains thanks to their nearlyvertical backrests higgins our interpretation of the chesterfield brings style and support with a subtly angled backrest that avoids uncomfortable pressure points higgins is also better because chesterfield is kind of a lame name better suited for a foulsmelling cologne or a discontinued brand of cigarettes right like contestants in a beauty pageant our furniture pieces are not evaluated on looks alone we believe that comfort durability and practicality are core components to good design and we think youll agree not your neighbors sofa yes we offer timeless wellknown styles but that doesnt mean you dont have an opportunity to express your personality our furniture can be ordered in dozens of colors and upholstery types and you can order pieces from our furniture families in varying widths and configurations to fit your space precisely our furniture is made on demand just for you which means your neighbor wont have the same sofa and thats probably good because you dont like that neighbor all that much never trims the weeds on the side of his house seriously it takes like ten minutes max if all

smell is moderate roast and coffeeespresso then heavy fruitiness that is wiped away by strong booze with a near rawwhite whiskey like note taste is follows a similar pattern from the aroma quick but strong roast and coffee then some raisiny fruitiness and a huge contribution from the alcoholester which is even more raw and strong than the aroma the booziness is a bit strong and detracts from the underlying malt flavors but it is still a unique taste mouthfeel is near cloying but with the malt backbone of this brew its where you might expect big malt sweetness some burn from the booziness and moderate carbonation overall this is no doubt a strong stout big malt and espresso notes some lighter chocolate but an impressive dose of ester booziness a sipper for sure or maybe one to let age just

lager   abv  rdev   avg look   smell   taste   feel   overall i picked up a bottle of wolverine state brewings vers lavant for  at the lager mill this one peaked my interest and im interested to see what they can do with this kind of beer so lets see how it goes  vintage poured from a brown oz golden foiled bottle into a teku a the label looks nice its got a nice design to it that goes well with the beer and its a little eye catching it poured a cloudy darker orange color that took on more of amber orange color when held to the light and it had almost three fingers worth of fluffy and creamy off white head that died down to a thick ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice rings of patchy lacing behind this is a good looking beer i have no complaints s the aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with a pear juice aroma being the first to show up and it has a fermented like aroma to it up next comes a little bit of a soapy aroma that leads into a little bit of a funky aroma towards the end comes the malts which impart some grainy pale malt bready and sweet malt like aromas this beer has a pretty nice aroma but i wish the pear aspect was cleaner t the taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with higher amount of medium sweetness with the pear juice still being the first to show up and it impart a sharp fermented pear juice flavor that goes right into a herbal and lightly grassy flavor followed by a little funkiness up next comes the malts which impart all the aspects that they did in the aroma and they are just a little lighter this time on the finish theres a lighter amount of medium medicinal like bitterness with a fermented pear juice like aftertaste this is nice tasting beer but i still wish the pear aspect was cleaner m a little smooth slightly cloying a little sticky on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation the mouthfeel is nice but i wish it was a little smoother overall i thought this was a nice beer and a solid example of the style it didnt blow me away or anything but it was pretty much just as advertised i just didnt think it would be as funky and fermented as it was this beer had ok drinkability one is enough for me anymore than that and it would start to wear on me what i like the most about this beer is the appearance its a good looking beer what i like the least about this beer is that the pear aspects werent cleaner and it could use a little less bitterness i dont think i would buy this beer again and i cant say its a must try but if your dont mind some fermented pear flavors than its worth checking out all in all i liked this beer but i didnt love it i liked the direction it was going in and with some cleaning up i could see this being a good beer its not a favorite wolverine state beer and its a solid example of the style solid job guys but this one has the potential to be better  charactersstouthunter  minutes agoten fidy bourbon barrel

duplicitousbaere brewing companyamerican wild ale   abv  rdev   avg look   smell   taste   feel   overall this is batch  of this from what i understand and apparently the abv and the nuances have fluctuated quite a lot from one to the next but this is super dialed in and if they brew it again i wouldnt change a thing its a wild ale aged in wine barrels with blackberries gorgeous artwork on the bottles like all of the baere stuff whoever whips those up is doing an awesome job the beer is killer too heavy red wine notes to it lots of dried cherries and berries and a strong wood and wine tannic presence along with the lactic sourness its somehow not that intense like its not sharp or striking everything is in balance and despite enormous complexity it doesnt feel overdone the blackberry is fresh and forward sweet for a second but absorbed into the heavy red wine complexion rather easily some funk here tons of wet wood and the sourness which has a citric element and is about as much as i want of it it has a berliner cleanness to it a freshness too with the fruit but also a wonderful maturity complex on the yeast side and dry in the finish with the wood closing it out notes of cocoa in the malt tobacco even but its not dark or heavy on my tongue despite only average carbonation this is expert wild beer a perfect fusion of fruit and barrel and something to be celebrated still somehow these guys arent getting the attention i think they deserve for these beers i would like to try other editions of this one and really take in some of the differences between them but this one is special i sure it will age wonderfully too as the blackberry fades into the wine gorgeous specimen  charactersstonedtrippin  minutes agodaylilyfox farm breweryamerican double

wheat beer these guys have concocted for summer and as pineapple flavored beer goes its well ahead of the curve the cool part about this pale hazy and incredibly frothy brew is that its not at all sweet desite how much authentic pineapple flavor is in here its very natural but its dry in the end or at least drier than any other pineapple flavored beer i have ever had that wasnt a sour aroma of fresh and canned pineapple at the same time orange juice from concentrate and white wheat its simple so the pineapple comes through nicely the flavor is like that too with some juiced pineapple element to it really almost concentrated intense for a flash but mellow by the end still a beer first it rises and falls appropriately and just screams summertime at me i was nervous to order this one expecting it to be fake and sugary but its mighty authentic and fermented down just the right amount bootstrap continues to stay out of the spotlight despite some quality beers and a good amount of innovation this is essential summer drinking easy down and best when ice cold id almost advocate for a frosted mug with this one  charactersstonedtrippin  minutes agodeluxeburyindependent

milwaukee about  years ago pours that feint straw yellow you tend to not dig on ok so im getting a proverbial diet lager almost whatevs we can still make this work did i mention a super thin  white head that disappears quickly aroma of grain didnt they used to make these in green bottles i want my euro skunk lager smell dammit taste is almost nil mouth feel is a grain and grass dryness almost no hopping high carbonation light body there isnt much more to say about it bland if you like that word i guess i prefer to think of it as a beer you can just pound without getting into tasting notes too

white head that dissipates rapidly to a thin rime really pretty lacing mild fruit with hints of apricot and apple tastes bright and clean no funk at all fruit is definitely not the predominant flavor thought it would be more fruity reminds me of a weak lager except for the lack of hop bite light and refreshing on the palate good carbonation faint sweet finish overall a nice beer very drinkable

 avg look   smell   taste   feel   overall i picked up a bottle of heavy seas tropicannon citrus ipa for  at the lager mill im always down to give a new citrus ipa a try so lets see how it goes  vintage poured from a brown oz bottle into an ipa glass a the label looks nice it goes well with the name and its a little eye catching it poured a nice orange color that takes on a little more of a darker orange color when held to the light and it has almost two fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind this is a pretty nice looking beer but i wish it had just a little better lacing s the aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the fruits being the first to show up and it imparts nice blends of fruity aromas that gives it a fruit punk like aroma with some nice citrus and tropical fruit aromas coming through and its followed by a little more sweetness up next comes a little bit of doughy yeast and its followed by a light hop aroma with not much malty aromas coming through this beer has a good aroma i like the fruit punch aspects but i wish the hops and malts showed up a little more t the taste seems to be similar to the aroma but its a little more balance and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness with the fruits still being the first to show up and they impart those fruit punch like aspects that they did in the aroma and its really juicy up next comes some more sweetness with the hops showing up next and they impart a generic hoppy flavor with a little bit of citrus hop and green hops on the finish theres a medium amount of bitterness with a little more sweetness and it had a very fruity aftertaste this is a pretty nice tasting beer but it would be really good if it was a little more balanced m smooth a little cloying refreshing crisp medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation the mouthfeel is pretty nice and it works well with this beer overall i thought it was a nice beer but it wasnt that greatest example of the style when it came down to it the taste was a little more like a shandy than an ipa this beer has nice drinkability i could drink a couple of them without getting bored with it what i like the most about this beer is the fruity flavors they were nice and juicy what i like the least about this beer is the balance i wish more malts and hops came through to balance out the fruits and make it feel not so shandy like i would buy this beer again when looking for a fruity beer and i would recommend it to anyone else looking for the same all in all i liked this beer but i didnt really like it as an ipa since it just felt like it was more of a fruit beer in almost every aspect its not my favorite beer from this brewery and its not the greatest example of the style you guys made a tasty beer but i just not sure its tasty ipa  charactersstouthunter  minutes agosaison des dunesmicrobrasserie

large tulip lasting around  minutes with moderate legs and lace but a good swirl response flavors of sweet grains lemon grapefruits orange peels wild and brett yeast peppercorn caramel with floral hops strong strength finish quite dry and boozy a bit peppery with dominant sour fruits that is more citrusy than tropical including a thick malty leathery feel ends leafy and tongue coating not crisp enough nor zesty too alcoholic feels like  so it lacks complexity hits the accessibility too and not quite as fresh as it should slightly off and not like a usual saison more like a barley pale ale cross tripel spiciness some bardyard feel is present yet quickly overwhelmed by the malts highly warming stuff though with some tweaks it could be interesting until then overall this is an okay

works this is surprisingly quite nice i was apprehensive about it its certainly not thick but its not as thin as i thought it would be its super drinkable with a heavy roasted character smooth chocolate black coffee and a hint of smoke on the finish this is very creamy even being on normal co i was super happy it wasnt presented on nitro this is definitely a really nice beer i could drink a

drinkable taste with excellent balance crisp smooth and refreshing makes for a light mouthfeel lots of carbonation but it works well with this brew really good pilz you can drink it all day goes down

companyamerican pale lager   abv  rdev   avg look   smell   taste   feel   overall i picked up a bottle of wolverine state brewings vers lavant for  at the lager mill this one peaked my interest and im interested to see what they can do with this kind of beer so lets see how it goes  vintage poured from a brown oz golden foiled bottle into a teku a the label looks nice its got a nice design to it that goes well with the beer and its a little eye catching it poured a cloudy darker orange color that took on more of amber orange color when held to the light and it had almost three fingers worth of fluffy and creamy off white head that died down to a thick ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice rings of patchy lacing behind this is a good looking beer i have no complaints s the aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with a pear juice aroma being the first to show up and it has a fermented like aroma to it up next comes a little bit of a soapy aroma that leads into a little bit of a funky aroma towards the end comes the malts which impart some grainy pale malt bready and sweet malt like aromas this beer has a pretty nice aroma but i wish the pear aspect was cleaner t the taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with higher amount of medium sweetness with the pear juice still being the first to show up and it impart a sharp fermented pear juice flavor that goes right into a herbal and lightly grassy flavor followed by a little funkiness up next comes the malts which impart all the aspects that they did in the aroma and they are just a little lighter this time on the finish theres a lighter amount of medium medicinal like bitterness with a fermented pear juice like aftertaste this is nice tasting beer but i still wish the pear aspect was cleaner m a little smooth slightly cloying a little sticky on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation the mouthfeel is nice but i wish it was a little smoother overall i thought this was a nice beer and a solid example of the style it didnt blow me away or anything but it was pretty much just as advertised i just didnt think it would be as funky and fermented as it was this beer had ok drinkability one is enough for me anymore than that and it would start to wear on me what i like the most about this beer is the appearance its a good looking beer what i like the least about this beer is that the pear aspects werent cleaner and it could use a little less bitterness i dont think i would buy this beer again and i cant say its a must try but if your dont mind some fermented pear flavors than its worth checking out all in all i liked this beer but i didnt love it i liked the direction it was going in and with some cleaning up i could see this being a good beer its not a favorite wolverine state beer and its a solid example of the style solid job guys but this one has the potential to be better  charactersstouthunter  minutes agoten fidy

agoblackberry duplicitousbaere brewing companyamerican wild ale   abv  rdev   avg look   smell   taste   feel   overall this is batch  of this from what i understand and apparently the abv and the nuances have fluctuated quite a lot from one to the next but this is super dialed in and if they brew it again i wouldnt change a thing its a wild ale aged in wine barrels with blackberries gorgeous artwork on the bottles like all of the baere stuff whoever whips those up is doing an awesome job the beer is killer too heavy red wine notes to it lots of dried cherries and berries and a strong wood and wine tannic presence along with the lactic sourness its somehow not that intense like its not sharp or striking everything is in balance and despite enormous complexity it doesnt feel overdone the blackberry is fresh and forward sweet for a second but absorbed into the heavy red wine complexion rather easily some funk here tons of wet wood and the sourness which has a citric element and is about as much as i want of it it has a berliner cleanness to it a freshness too with the fruit but also a wonderful maturity complex on the yeast side and dry in the finish with the wood closing it out notes of cocoa in the malt tobacco even but its not dark or heavy on my tongue despite only average carbonation this is expert wild beer a perfect fusion of fruit and barrel and something to be celebrated still somehow these guys arent getting the attention i think they deserve for these beers i would like to try other editions of this one and really take in some of the differences between them but this one is special i sure it will age wonderfully too as the blackberry fades into the wine gorgeous specimen  charactersstonedtrippin  minutes agodaylilyfox farm breweryamerican double

reminds me a tiny bit of jai alai worth having again  characterspicopapa  minutes agochillax wheatbootstrap brewingamerican pale wheat ale  rdev   avg look   smell   taste   feel   overall a pineapple wheat beer these guys have concocted for summer and as pineapple flavored beer goes its well ahead of the curve the cool part about this pale hazy and incredibly frothy brew is that its not at all sweet desite how much authentic pineapple flavor is in here its very natural but its dry in the end or at least drier than any other pineapple flavored beer i have ever had that wasnt a sour aroma of fresh and canned pineapple at the same time orange juice from concentrate and white wheat its simple so the pineapple comes through nicely the flavor is like that too with some juiced pineapple element to it really almost concentrated intense for a flash but mellow by the end still a beer first it rises and falls appropriately and just screams summertime at me i was nervous to order this one expecting it to be fake and sugary but its mighty authentic and fermented down just the right amount bootstrap continues to stay out of the spotlight despite some quality beers and a good amount of innovation this is essential summer drinking easy down and best when ice cold id almost advocate for a frosted mug with this one  charactersstonedtrippin  minutes agodeluxeburyindependent

 avg look   smell   taste   feel   overall i picked up a bottle of heavy seas tropicannon citrus ipa for  at the lager mill im always down to give a new citrus ipa a try so lets see how it goes  vintage poured from a brown oz bottle into an ipa glass a the label looks nice it goes well with the name and its a little eye catching it poured a nice orange color that takes on a little more of a darker orange color when held to the light and it has almost two fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind this is a pretty nice looking beer but i wish it had just a little better lacing s the aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the fruits being the first to show up and it imparts nice blends of fruity aromas that gives it a fruit punk like aroma with some nice citrus and tropical fruit aromas coming through and its followed by a little more sweetness up next comes a little bit of doughy yeast and its followed by a light hop aroma with not much malty aromas coming through this beer has a good aroma i like the fruit punch aspects but i wish the hops and malts showed up a little more t the taste seems to be similar to the aroma but its a little more balance and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness with the fruits still being the first to show up and they impart those fruit punch like aspects that they did in the aroma and its really juicy up next comes some more sweetness with the hops showing up next and they impart a generic hoppy flavor with a little bit of citrus hop and green hops on the finish theres a medium amount of bitterness with a little more sweetness and it had a very fruity aftertaste this is a pretty nice tasting beer but it would be really good if it was a little more balanced m smooth a little cloying refreshing crisp medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation the mouthfeel is pretty nice and it works well with this beer overall i thought it was a nice beer but it wasnt that greatest example of the style when it came down to it the taste was a little more like a shandy than an ipa this beer has nice drinkability i could drink a couple of them without getting bored with it what i like the most about this beer is the fruity flavors they were nice and juicy what i like the least about this beer is the balance i wish more malts and hops came through to balance out the fruits and make it feel not so shandy like i would buy this beer again when looking for a fruity beer and i would recommend it to anyone else looking for the same all in all i liked this beer but i didnt really like it as an ipa since it just felt like it was more of a fruit beer in almost every aspect its not my favorite beer from this brewery and its not the greatest example of the style you guys made a tasty beer but i just not sure its tasty ipa  charactersstouthunter  minutes agosaison des dunesmicrobrasserie

hops strong strength finish quite dry and boozy a bit peppery with dominant sour fruits that is more citrusy than tropical including a thick malty leathery feel ends leafy and tongue coating not crisp enough nor zesty too alcoholic feels like  so it lacks complexity hits the accessibility too and not quite as fresh as it should slightly off and not like a usual saison more like a barley pale ale cross tripel spiciness some bardyard feel is present yet quickly overwhelmed by the malts highly warming stuff though with some tweaks it could be interesting until then overall this is an okay

booming home furnishing brand roger  chris close lifestyle entertainment lgbt opinion technology lifestyle entertainment lgbt opinion technology home entertainment arts get to know booming home furnishing brand roger  chris entertainmentartsbusinesslifestylestyle get to know booming home furnishing brand roger  chris by ryan shea  jul     share facebook twitter credit alec hemer with the summer in full swing many manhattanites and creative people beyond are looking to upgrade their space to make it look fresh and new when guests show up to their house  whether it is a place to crash for a couple of days a great party celebrating someone’s birthday or your brand new renovated dining room to enjoy with your family the home furnishing business is really in full swing  one business that is on the up and up and making quite the name for themselves in a very short time is roger  chris who are based right outside manhattan in sharon springs new york credit chris stouthazard roger  chris otherwise known as chris stouthazard and roger hazard have a mission to as they say it “unboring your home”  roger has had quite the history being in front of the camera how can you blame the audience for not wanting to see him giggity for huge shows such as “sell this house” and “move this house”  chris on the other hand came from the world of clevel technology who developed himself as a major web pioneer and someone who thanks to his design and marketing helped startup companies become national brands in a short period of time  then they met and decided to shift everything they were doing to make roger chris roger  chris offers a variety of distinctive products for the everyday home all made in the usa  whether it is lighting furniture pillows or on the go they pretty much have you covered to make sure the idea you have for your house comes to fruition  they also have a great web series that they do called “roger that” available on their website where they transform homes with bright colors patterns and more to give it a modern feel about itself  essentially from my point of view they are the new dynamic duo of the home furnishing world and in a short five years have taken a simple idea and have turned it into something so much bigger than that i recently spoke to one half of the team chris stouthazard about all of this from their beginnings favorite projects tips galore and future of their business credit kathi mello what inspired you to get involved in home furnishings in the first place we were frustrated with trying to find good furniture for our design clients we found that most folks were resorting to buying furniture from the big names where you could choose from just a couple of colors and sizes we knew there was an audience looking for more variety more colors etc at the same time those big companies have to spend so much on their showrooms and catalogs and fake “sales” that they can’t deliver a very wellbuilt product we knew we could deliver higherquality furniture if we focused on working oneonone with our customers online and that’s exactly what we did was this a joint thing or did one of you have to convince the other somewhat to make this into a big business i think we were both excited about starting a new business together the timing just happened to work out roger had spent over a decade on tv with all that that entails – flying around the country every week living out of hotels and not having much time to pursue design projects i was a partner in a startup that was wrapping up after a decade in the financial industry i was ready for a change maybe we convinced each other a little bit seeing as you both are a couple do you find that the home furnishing business is pro lgbt and have you ever encountered anything negative in your business due to your sexuality yes the furniture industry is prolgbt there has always been a huge presence of lgbt folks in the world of design including a lot of the biggest names in the industry that said as a group we’re very concerned about issues like north carolina’s hb law that’s their antilgbt “bathroom bill” much of the furniture manufacturing in the usa happens in north carolina and we collectively have to work to ensure the talented folks building our products are protected from discrimination so there has been a lot of pressure from furniture manufacturers along with most industries in the state to get these laws repealed how would you exactly define “roger and chris” as a business in one sentence how about “serious designers that don’t take themselves too seriously” credit chris stouthazard is everything from your company handmade and domestic from the start we decided that all of roger  chris’s products should be made in the usa we think it’s the right thing to do for the economic health of our country but it also gives us some important advantages – it means that we have the ability to custom build every piece to our customers’ specifications instead of mass producing overseas vegan or allergic to down not a problem we can build your sofa with alternative materials want a lamp a bit taller or with a blue cord instead of a red one we can do that just as important we know exactly what chemicals are and aren’t being used in our products it’s shocking to find out what goes into a lot of the imported furniture on the market building in the usa ensures not just the quality of the products but the conditions for the people crafting them what would you say is the biggest trend furniture wise for the summer and fall seasons the bohemian look is everywhere right now white walls eclectic and colorful furniture lots of moroccan textiles and tons of houseplants for furniture we’re seeing a lot of demand from designers for lighter saddlecolored leather and olive green fabrics do you have a favorite project that you have worked on so far and why every project has something exciting – we recently wrapped up a wine bar in connecticut that featured a lot of our furniture and lighting that turned out beautifully and we’re doing a number of residential projects that each have interesting features but we probably have the most fun working on our own home it’s a chance to really play and try out new ideas plus when it’s finished you get to hang out and enjoy it for a while credit chris stouthazard what would you say are your biggest tips to new homeowners who really want to make their space flourish without it being too loud or dull here’s the most important thing to remember when putting together your home or apartment as a warning it sounds simplistic but it’s important nonetheless it’s okay to like what you like we talk to many homeowners who struggle with making decisions and much of the time they’re worried about impressing guests or fitting in with what’s currently popular or that they will be breaking some sort of rule if they deviate from what they’ve seen on hgtv design isn’t chemistry or physics – there are guidelines but they aren’t laws it’s your house so give yourself permission to experiment have fun and surround yourself with things you love having a home that reflects your personality keeps you centered and your guests will pick up on that too what would you say would be your biggest goal for roger and chris that you have your sights set on we just had our fourth birthday but we’re still just warming up our goal at this point is to keep reaching new people teaching them about design and hooking them up with awesome furniture tailored to their needs what’s next for the two of you  a nap sounds good right about now for more information on roger  chris check out their official site related related articlesmore from author last weekend for immersive show
