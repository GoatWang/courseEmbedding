low by the option market as of right now well detail it below  but thats the lede  the option market is reflecting a sort of risk malaise for now an iv of  versus the iv of the sp  at  the annual high for williams partners lp iv is   and were below that level the alert here is low vol one thing to note beyond the risk malaise alert which we cover in the article is that while implied volatility may be low the real question that needs to be answered for option sellers is not if the implied vol is low but rather if the realized volatility that is coming in the next  days will be lower than the option market is pricing to skip ahead of this risk alert and see if buying or selling options has been a winner in williams partners lp you can go here getting serious about option trading preface this is a proprietary risk rating and risk alert system that looks forward for the next month  or really  days to be exact  and that includes weekends the system is based on multiple interactions of

show in great specificity that there is actually a lot less luck in successful option trading than many people know the whole concept of an option trading expert is vastly over complicated and well talk about how superior returns are earned but first lets turn back to wpz and the companys risk rating we also take a peek at the implied vol for the energy etf xle our broad based proxy for wpz

lowered level relative to the companys past the option market reflects a  confidence interval stock price range of   within the next  calendar days while the option market risk rating is on the low side we note that companies in this situation are still susceptible to sudden stock move risk its simply the probability of that large stock move is depressed buyers of options and volatility may find these prices more attractive than at other times wpz option market risk the iv® is the risk reflected by the option market in the stock price for the next  calendar days  its forward looking williams partners lp shows an iv of  which is a substantially lowered level for the company relative to its past the option market for wpz has shown an iv annual low of  and an annual high of  meaning that wpz is at the  percentile right now heres a table of the data before we dig into the risk rating further wpz current iv     wpz low iv     wpz high iv       the implied stock swing risk from the option market is significantly tighter in the next  calendar days for williams partners lp nysewpz than it has been on average for the year further if we look backwards the stock has a realized day historical volatility called the hv of  we have an unusual situation now where the iv is substantially depressed relative to the past but even with that risk pricing the option market reflects the likelihood of more stock movement in the next days than it has in the last days lets turn to a chart to see whats going on   note how much higher the forward looking stock swing price risk for williams partners lp is priced  compared to what happened just in the last days  williams partners lp risk rating the wpz risk rating is at  where the rating goes from one the lowest risk to five the
