maschinefabrik defendantbycrossclaim united states district court e d tennessee northeastern division november   attorneys appearing for the case gene p gaby and thomas l kilday milligan coleman fletcher  gaby greeneville tenn for thomas dewey holt samuel b miller and samuel b miller ii johnson city tenn for stihl inc joseph o fuller and gene h tunnell fuller  tunnell kingsport tenn for andreas stihl maschinefabrik memorandum opinion and order neese district judge this is a civil action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained while using a product which was manufactured andor sold by the respective defendants  usc §§ a  c the plaintiff excepted to the pretrial order herein of november   requesting the court to delete therefrom as a contested issue of fact whether    any negligence of the plaintiff proximately caused or contributed to cause his injuries and damages    the plaintiff contends that any contributory negligence on his behalf is irrelevant herein since he is proceeding only on theories of strict liability in tort and breach of certain implied warranties jurisdiction herein being based on the diverse citizenship of the parties and the requisite amount in controversy this court is required to apply the substantive law of tennessee erie r co v tompkins   us    sct   led   boatland inc v brunswick corp cath   fd   thereunder it is clear that    the only emphasis in original form of contributory negligence which can be used as a defense in strict products liability cases is that known as assumption of risk    ellithorpe v ford motor company tenn   swd   assumption of risk is separately stated as a contested issue of fact in the pretrial order therefore as to the plaintiffs strict liability claim mr holts own negligence is irrelevant the uniform commercial code as adopted in tennessee includes no specific provision as to whether contributory negligence is a defense in a breach of warranty products liability case furthermore there appears to be no tennessee case addressing itself to this issue therefore this court is required    to make a considered educated guess as to what decision the supreme court of tennessee would reach on these facts    lee v crenshaw cath   fd   in tennessee an action for breach of warranty has been viewed generally as one sounding in contract as opposed to tort law see e g curtis v murphy elevator co dctenn   fsupp  great am music mach inc v midsouth record pressing co dctenn   fsupp  and cumberland corporation v e i dupont de nemours  co dc tenn   fsupp  thus it would seem that the tort concept of contributory negligence would have no application to such actions as to those jurisdictions in which courts have considered this issue there appears to be some disagreement one commentator has summarized that          some cases hold or state that contributory negligence is available as a defense and there is also some authority which impliedly supports the view that contributory negligence where established will bar recovery for breach of warranty on the other hand there are decisions holding or indicating that contributory negligence is not available as a defense in an action for an alleged breach of warranty and there appears to be some conflict even within some jurisdictions as to whether contributory negligence is a defense emphases in original        hursh  bailey american law of products liability d ed  §  according to the footnotes noted in that quotation california seems to be the jurisdiction which has most often considered this question and its courts have consistently held that contributory negligence is not a defense to warranty suits see preston v upright inc   calappd   calrptr  crane v sears roebuck  co   calappd   calrptr  vassallo v sabatte land co   calappd   calrptr  and kassouf v lee brothers inc   calappd   calrptr  see also young v aeroil products co cath   fd  the more recent decisions of other jurisdictions appear to follow the california approach in refusing to recognize such a defense similarly two noted authors in this field have concluded that    the better view is that contributory negligence as such    is not a defense    to a warranty action frumer  fiedman products liability §  warranty accord comment products liability for the defense—contributory fault  tennlrev   this same rule has been applied by the court of appeals for this circuit in a diversity case arising in michigan murphy v eaton yale  towne inc cath   fd   from all which it is the considered opinion of this court that if the tennessee supreme court were faced squarely with the issue now presented herein it would conclude that in this jurisdiction contributory negligence as such is not a proper defense to a breach of warranty action such as this accordingly the plaintiffs aforementioned exception to the pretrial order herein hereby is granted and contested issue of fact therein ive hereby is stricken footnotes  see restatement of the law second torts d § a  tca §§    this is not to imply however that the plaintiffs conduct whether amounting to negligence or not might not constitute a misuse of the product involved comment your
