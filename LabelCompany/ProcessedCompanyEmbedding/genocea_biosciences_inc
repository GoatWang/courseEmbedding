of the infection gen is a firstinclass investigational t celldirected immunotherapy designed to elicit both a t cell and b cell antibody immune response the immunotherapy was designed using genocea’s atlas™ platform which profiles the comprehensive spectrum of actual t cell responses mounted by humans in response to disease and identifies antigen targets that drive effective t cell responses gen includes the antigens icp and gd along with matrixm™ adjuvant licensed from novavax inc nasdaqnvax for more information about gen please visit the gen section of the genocea website about genital herpesgenital herpes affects more than  million people worldwide and causes recurrent painful genital lesions it can be transmitted to sexual partners even when the disease is asymptomatic current genital herpes therapies only partially control clinical symptoms and viral shedding a process which drives disease transmission incomplete control of genital lesions and transmission risk expense and the perceived inconvenience of taking a daily medication are hurdles for longterm disease management immunity through t cells is believed to be particularly critical to the control and possible prevention of genital herpes infections about genocea biosciences incgenocea is harnessing the power of t cell immunity to develop lifechanging vaccines and immunotherapies while traditional immunotherapy discovery methods have largely used predictive methods to propose t cell targets or antigens genocea has successfully developed atlas™ its proprietary technology platform to identify clinically relevant antigens of t cells based on actual human immune responses genocea used atlas to identify the antigens in its lead clinical candidate gen an investigational immunotherapy to treat genital herpes and is currently using atlas in immunooncology applications to develop neoantigen cancer vaccines with an ind filing expected by the end of  general cancer vaccines and a vaccine
