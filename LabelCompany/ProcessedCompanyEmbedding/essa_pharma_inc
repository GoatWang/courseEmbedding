and proprietary therapies for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer crpc in patients whose disease is progressing despite treatment with current therapies essa believes that its product candidate epi can significantly expand the interval of time in which patients suffering from crpc can benefit from hormonebased therapies specifically epi acts by disrupting the androgen receptor ar signaling pathway which is the primary pathway that drives prostate cancer growth epi the primary metabolite of epi prevents ar activation by binding selectively to the nterminal domain ntd of the ar a functional ntd is essential for activation of the ar blocking the ntd prevents activation of the ar by all three known mechanisms of activation in preclinical studies blocking the ntd has demonstrated the capability to overcome the known ardependent mechanisms of crpc essa was founded in  about prostate cancerprostate cancer is the secondmost commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the fifth most common cause of male cancer death worldwide globocan  adenocarcinoma of the prostate is dependent on androgen for tumor progression and depleting or blocking androgen action has been a mainstay of hormonal treatment for over six decades although tumors are often initially sensitive to medical or surgical therapies that decrease levels of testosterone disease progression despite castrate levels of testosterone generally represents a transition to the lethal variant of the disease mcrpc and most patients ultimately succumb to the illness the treatment of mcrpc patients has evolved rapidly over the past five years despite these advances additional treatment options are needed to improve clinical outcomes in patients particularly those who fail existing treatments including abiraterone or enzalutamide or those who have contraindications to receive those drugs over time patients with mcrpc generally experience continued disease progression worsening pain leading to substantial morbidity and limited survival rates in both in vitro and in vivo animal studies essas novel approach to blocking the androgen pathway has been shown to be effective in blocking tumor growth when current therapies are no longer effective forwardlooking statement disclaimer this release contains certain information which as presented constitutes forwardlooking information within the

androgen receptor the androgen receptor ar plays an essential role in controlling the effects of androgen hormones and cell growth in certain cancers including prostate and breast cancer the ar is composed of three domains ligandbinding domain – binds to androgen hormones dnabinding domain – binds to dna in cells nterminal domain – controls the ability of the ar to regulate gene transcription the nterminal domain controls the transcriptional activity of the ar a critical function necessary for ardriven cancer cell growth cancer cell adaptations such as mutations maintain ardriven tumor growth despite low circulating levels of androgen and despite the potential presence of androgen inhibitors furthermore some truncated ar splice variants that lack a ligandbinding domain retain their activity independent of androgen and represent a resistance mechanism to existing hormone therapies by directly inhibiting the ar nterminal domain epi compounds have the potential to overcome these
