registered with the commission as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended and serves as the investment adviser to the fund the fund currently consists of thirtyeight investment portfolios including six investment portfolios that are sold only to separate accounts of insurance companies in conjunction with variable life and variable annuity contracts va small value

“portfolios” the fund or any future funds may offer one or more start printed page additional investment portfolios in the future also referred to as “portfolios”  shares of the portfolios will be offered to separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies each a “participating insurance company” to serve as investment vehicles to fund variable contracts these separate accounts either will be registered as investment companies under the  act or will be exempt from such registration pursuant to exemptions from registration under section c of the  act individually a “separate account” and collectively the “separate accounts” shares of the portfolios may also be offered to qualified plans dfa or certain related corporations collectively “dfa” and any other person permitted to hold shares of the funds pursuant to treasury regulation  “general accounts” including the general account of any life insurance company whose separate account holds or will hold shares of the funds or certain related corporations  the participating insurance companies at the time of their investment in the funds either have or will establish their own separate accounts and design their own variable contracts each participating insurance company has or will have the legal obligation of satisfying all applicable requirements under both state and federal law each participating insurance company on behalf of its separate accounts has or will enter into an agreement with the funds concerning such participating insurance companys participation in the portfolios the role of the funds under this agreement insofar as the federal securities laws are applicable will consist of among other things offering shares of the portfolios to the participating separate accounts and complying with any conditions that the commission may impose upon granting the order requested herein  on november   the commission issued an order granting exemptive relief to permit shares of the funds to be sold to and held by variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies investment company act release no  file no  the “original order” the original order allows the fund to offer its shares to insurance companies as the investment vehicle for their separate accounts supporting variable contracts the original order does not include the future funds as parties nor expressly address the sale of shares of the funds or any future funds to qualified plans unregistered separate accounts dfa or general accounts applicants propose that the future funds be added as parties to the original order and the funds and any future funds be permitted to offer and sell their shares to qualified plans unregistered separate accounts dfa and the general accounts applicants legal analysis  applicants and certain life insurance companies and their separate accounts that currently invest or may hereafter invest in the fund and to the extent necessary any investment adviser principal underwriter and depositor of such an account seek exemptive relief from the provisions of sections a a a and b of the  act and rules eb and etb thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the portfolios and shares of any future funds to be sold to and held by i separate accounts funding variable contracts issued by both affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies ii qualified plans outside of the separate account context iii separate accounts that are not registered as investment companies under the  act pursuant to exemptions from registration under section c of the  act iv dfa or certain related corporations collectively “dfa” and v any general accounts including the general account of any life insurance company whose separate account holds or will hold shares of the funds or certain related corporations  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered as a unit investment trust “uit” under the  act rule eb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act the relief provided by rule e is also granted to the investment adviser principal underwriter and depositor of the separate account section a of the  act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any uit if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  of the  act sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying investment companys shares rule eb provides these exemptions apply only where all of the assets of the uit are shares of management investment companies “which offer their shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company” therefore the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account or flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or any other affiliated insurance company the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding”  the relief granted by rule eb also is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts funding variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity andor variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to herein as “shared funding”  the relief under rule eb is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares of the portfolios are also to be sold to qualified plans or other eligible holders of shares as described above applicants note that if shares of the portfolios are sold only to qualified plans exemptive relief under rule e would not be necessary the relief provided for under this section does not relate to qualified plans or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to qualified plans the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity and variable life separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies and for qualified plans is referred to herein as “extended mixed and shared funding”  in connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a uit rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act the exemptions granted by rule estart printed page tb are available only where all the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies that offer to sell their shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance companies offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account” therefore rule etb permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding the exemptions are also granted to the investment adviser principal underwriter and depositor of the separate account  the relief under rule et is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company and additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares of the portfolios are also to be sold to qualified plans or other eligible holders of shares as described above applicants note that if shares of the portfolios were sold only to qualified plans exemptive relief under rule etb would not be necessary the relief provided for under this section does not relate to qualified plans or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to qualified plans  applicants maintain as discussed below that there is no policy reason for the sale of the portfolios shares to qualified plans to dfa or general accounts to result in a prohibition against or otherwise limit a participating insurance company from relying on the relief provided by rules eb and etb however because the relief under rules eb and etb is available only when shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts additional exemptive relief may be necessary if the shares of the portfolios are also to be sold to qualified plans dfa or general accounts applicants therefore request relief in order to have the participating insurance companies enjoy the benefits of the relief granted in rules eb and etb applicants note that if the portfolios shares were to be sold only to qualified plans dfa general accounts andor separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts exemptive relief under rule e and rule et would be unnecessary the relief provided for under rules eb and etb does not relate to qualified plans dfa or general accounts or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to such purchasers  applicants also note that the promulgation of rules eb and etb preceded the issuance of the regulations issued by the treasury department “regulations” that made it possible for shares of an investment company portfolio to be held by the trustee of a qualified plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company portfolio also to be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts thus the sale of shares of the same portfolio to both separate accounts and qualified plans was not contemplated at the time of the adoption of rules eb and etb  consistent with the commissions authority under section c of the  act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions this application requests relief for the class consisting of insurers and separate accounts that will invest in the portfolios and to the extent necessary qualified plans other eligible holders of shares and investment advisers principal underwriters and depositors of such accounts  section a of the  act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and rules etbi and ii under the  act provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying management company  the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb under the  act from the requirements of section  of the  act in effect limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  those  act rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to individuals in a large insurance company complex most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization the participating insurance companies and qualified plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the funds those individuals who participate in the management of the funds will remain the same regardless of which separate accounts or qualified plans invests in the funds applying the monitoring requirements of section a of the  act because of investment by separate accounts of other insurers or qualified plans would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose furthermore the increased monitoring costs could reduce the net rates of return realized by contract owners  moreover since the qualified plans dfa and general accounts are not themselves investment companies and therefore are not subject to section  of the  act and will not be deemed affiliates solely by virtue of their shareholdings no additional relief is necessary  rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirement with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract between such a fund and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of rules e and et respectively under the  act rules ebiiib and e tbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in an underlying funds investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii biib and biic respectively of rules e and et under the  act  rule e under the  act recognizes that a variable life insurance contract as an insurance contract has important elements unique to insurance contracts and is subject to extensive start printed page state regulation of insurance in adopting rule ebiii the commission expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations to disapprove or require changes in investment policies investment advisers or principal underwriters the commission also expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority to require an insurer to draw from its general account to cover costs imposed upon the insurer by a change approved by contract owners over the insurers objection the commission therefore deemed such exemptions necessary “to assure the solvency of the life insurer and performance of its contractual obligations by enabling an insurance regulatory authority or the life insurer to act when certain proposals reasonably could be expected to increase the risks undertaken by the life insurer” in this respect applicants state flexible premium variable life insurance contracts are identical to scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts therefore the corresponding provisions of rule et under the  act undoubtedly were adopted in recognition of the same factors  applicants state that the sale of portfolio shares to qualified plans dfa and general accounts will not have any impact on the relief requested herein with respect to the qualified plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to qualified plan participants indeed to the contrary applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with qualified plan assets to certain specified persons under section a of the employee retirement income security act as amended “erisa” shares of a portfolio of a fund sold to a qualified plan must be held by the trustees of the qualified plan section a also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the qualified plan with two exceptions i when the qualified plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan and not contrary to erisa and ii when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the qualified plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of the above two exceptions stated in section a applies qualified plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies  where a named fiduciary to a qualified plan appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary the qualified plans may have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the qualified plans in their discretion some of the qualified plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants similarly dfa and general accounts are not subject to any passthrough voting requirements accordingly unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with qualified plans dfa or general accounts  where a qualified plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions the trustee or named fiduciary has responsibility to vote the shares held by the qualified plan in this circumstance the trustee has a fiduciary duty to vote the shares in the best interest of the qualified plan participants accordingly even if dfa or an affiliate of dfa were to serve in the capacity of trustee or named fiduciary with voting responsibilities dfa or the affiliates would have a fiduciary duty to vote those shares in the best interest of the qualified plan participants  in addition even if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in a portfolio applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such portfolio to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in a portfolio by a qualified plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding unlike mixed funding or shared funding qualified plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  where a qualified plan provides participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants see no reason to believe that participants in qualified plans generally or those in a particular qualified plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other qualified plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage variable contract holders thus applicants submit the purchase of shares of portfolios by qualified plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  the prohibitions on mixed and shared funding might reflect concern regarding possible different investment motivations among investors when rule e under the  act was adopted variable annuity separate accounts could invest in mutual funds whose shares also were offered to the general public therefore the commission staff contemplated underlying funds with public shareholders as well as with variable life insurance separate account shareholders the commission staff may have been concerned with the potentially different investment motivations of public shareholders and variable life insurance contract owners there also may have been some concern with respect to the problems of permitting a state insurance regulatory authority to affect the operations of a publicly available mutual fund and to affect the investment decisions of public shareholders  for reasons unrelated to the  act however internal revenue service revenue ruling  sept   effectively deprived variable annuities funded by publicly available mutual funds of their taxbenefited status the tax reform act of  codified the prohibition against the use of publicly available mutual funds as an investment vehicle for variable contracts including variable life contracts section h of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” in effect requires that the investments made by variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts be “adequately diversified” if a separate account is organized as a uit that invests in a single fund or series the diversification test will be applied at the underlying fund level rather than at the separate account level but only if “all of the beneficial interests” in the underlying fund “are held by one or more insurance companies or affiliated companies in their general account or in segregated asset accounts   ” accordingly a uit separate account that invests solely in a publicly available mutual fund will not be adequately diversified in addition any underlying mutual fund including any portfolio that sells shares to separate accounts in effect would be precluded from also selling its shares to start printed page the public consequently there will be no public shareholders of any portfolio  shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulatory body could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its policies the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem  shared funding by unaffiliated insurers in this respect is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers which rules eb and etb under the  act permit affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators then the affected insurer will be required to withdraw its separate accounts investment in the affected fund this requirement will be provided for in agreements that will be entered into by participating insurance companies with respect to their participation in the relevant portfolio  rules eb and etb under the  act give the insurance company the right to disregard the voting instructions of the contract owners this right does not raise any issues different from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts under rules eb and etb an insurer can disregard contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et under the  act that the insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific goodfaith determinations  a particular insurers disregard of voting instructions nevertheless could conflict with the majority of contract owners voting instructions the insurers action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other insurers including affiliated insurers that the voting instructions of contract owners should prevail and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view if the insurers judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the insurer may be required at the affected funds election to withdraw its separate accounts investment in such portfolio no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal this requirement will be provided for in the agreements entered into with respect to participation by the participating insurance companies in each portfolio  each portfolio will be managed to attempt to achieve the investment objective or objectives of such portfolio and not to favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance product there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of contracts including the “minimum death benefit” guarantee under certain variable life insurance contracts will lead to different investment policies for different types of variable contracts to the extent that the degree of risk may differ as between variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies the different insurance charges imposed in effect adjust any such differences and equalize the insurers exposure in either case  applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares of the portfolios to qualified plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those which would otherwise exist between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners moreover in considering the appropriateness of the requested relief applicants have analyzed the following issues to assure themselves that there were either no conflicts of interest or that there existed the ability by the affected parties to resolve the issues without harm to the contract owners in the separate accounts or to the participants under the qualified plans  applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the code regulations issued by the treasury department “regulations” or internal revenue service revenue rulings thereunder if qualified plans variable annuity separate accounts and variable life insurance separate accounts all invest in the same underlying fund as noted above section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable contracts held in an underlying mutual fund the code provides that a variable contract shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance as applicable for any period and any subsequent period for which the investments are not in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury department adequately diversified  regulations issued under section h of the code provide that in order to meet the statutory diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies however the regulations contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which allows shares in an underlying mutual fund to be held by the trustees of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of such shares also to be held by separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts treas reg fiii thus the regulations specifically permit “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to invest in the same underlying fund for this reason applicants have concluded that neither the code nor regulations nor internal revenue service revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if the qualified plans and separate accounts all invest in the same portfolio  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from variable contracts and qualified plans are taxed these differences will have no impact on the funds when distributions are to be made and a separate account or qualified plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the distributions the separate account and qualified plan will redeem shares of the relevant portfolio at their respective net asset value in conformity with rule c under the  act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs a participating insurance company then will make distributions in accordance with the terms of its variable contract and a qualified plan then will make distributions in start printed page accordance with the terms of the qualified plan  applicants state that there is analogous precedent for a situation in which the same funding vehicle was used for contract owners subject to different tax rules without any apparent conflicts prior to the tax reform act of  a number of insurance companies offered variable annuity contracts on both a qualified and nonqualified basis through the same separate account underlying reserves of both qualified and nonqualified contracts therefore were commingled in the same separate account however longterm capital gains incurred in such separate accounts were taxed on a different basis than shortterm gains and other income with respect to the reserves underlying nonqualified contracts a tax reserve at the estimated tax rate was established in the separate account affecting only the nonqualified reserves to the best of applicants knowledge that practice was never found to have violated any fiduciary standards accordingly applicants have concluded that the tax consequences of distributions with respect to participating insurance companies and qualified plans do not raise any conflicts of interest with respect to the use of the portfolios  in connection with any meeting of shareholders the soliciting fund will inform each shareholder including each separate account qualified plan dfa and general account of information necessary for the meeting including their respective share of ownership in the relevant portfolio each participating insurance company then will solicit voting instructions in accordance with rules e and et as applicable and its agreement with the funds concerning participation in the relevant portfolio shares of a portfolio that are held by dfa and any general account will be voted in the same proportion as all variable contract owners having voting rights with respect to that portfolio however dfa and any general account will vote their shares in such other manner as the commission may require shares held by qualified plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law the voting rights provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of a portfolio would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of funds sold to the general public furthermore if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a qualified plans decision to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the qualified plan may be required at the election of the affected fund to withdraw its investment in such portfolio and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal  applicants reviewed whether a “senior security” as such term is defined under section g of the  act is created with respect to any variable contract owner as opposed to a participant under a qualified plan dfa or a general account applicants concluded that the ability of the funds to sell shares of their portfolios directly to qualified plans dfa or a general account does not create a senior security “senior security” is defined under section g of the  act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends” as noted above regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under qualified plans or contract owners under variable contracts the qualified plans dfa general accounts and the separate accounts only have rights with respect to their respective shares of the portfolio they only can redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of a portfolio has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends applicants conditions applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions  a majority of the board of directors the “board” of the fund will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death disqualification or bonafide resignation of any director or directors then the operation of this condition will be suspended i for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board ii for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or iii for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application  the board will monitor the fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the contract owners of all separate accounts and participants of all qualified plans investing in such fund and determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including i an action by any state insurance regulatory authority ii a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretative letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities iii an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding iv the manner in which the investments of such fund are being managed v a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners variable life insurance contract owners and trustees of the qualified plans vi a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners or vii if applicable a decision by a qualified plan to disregard the voting instructions of qualified plan

participation agreement upon becoming an owner of  percent or more of the assets of any portfolio collectively “participants” will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board participants will be responsible for assisting the board in carrying out the boards responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised this responsibility includes but is not limited to an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the board whenever contract owner voting instructions are disregarded and if passthrough voting is applicable an obligation by each qualified plan to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board will be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their participation agreements with the fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contract owners the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board also will be contractual obligations of all qualified plans with participation agreements and such agreements will provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of qualified plan participants  if it is determined by a majority of the board or a majority of the start printed page disinterested directors of the board that a material irreconcilable conflict exists then the relevant participant will at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict up to and including i withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts from the relevant portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another portfolio or in the case of participating insurance company participants submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and as appropriate segregating the assets of any appropriate group ie annuity contract owners or life insurance contract owners of one or more participating insurance companies that votes in favor of such segregation or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change and ii establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard contract owner voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the insurer may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw such insurers separate accounts investment in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a qualified plans decision to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the qualified plan may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its investment in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal the responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of all participants under their agreements governing participation in the fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract owners and qualified plan participants for purposes of this condition  a majority of the disinterested members of the board will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will the fund dfa or an affiliate of dfa as relevant be required to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract no participating insurance company will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict further no qualified plan will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for the qualified plan if i a majority of the qualified plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer or ii pursuant to documents governing the qualified plan the qualified plan makes such decision without a qualified plan participant vote  the boards determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all participants  as to variable contracts issued by separate accounts registered under the  act participating insurance companies will provide passthrough voting privileges to all variable contract owners as required by the  act as interpreted by the commission however as to variable contracts issued by unregistered separate accounts passthrough voting privileges will be extended to contract owners to the extent granted by the issuing insurance company accordingly such participants where applicable will vote shares of the applicable portfolio held in their separate accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from variable contract owners participating insurance companies will be responsible for assuring that each separate account investing in a portfolio calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other participants the obligation to calculate voting privileges as provided in this application will be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their agreement with the funds governing
