crowdfunding  invest in the infrastructure to power crowdfundingnearly a century and a half ago thousands of entrepreneurial pioneers in search of opportunity and fortune set out to find gold in the american west some prospectors succeeded many did not but first every one of them invested in the picks and shovels they’d need to realize their dream some of the most successful entrepreneurs of the era though were not prospectors at all they were the visionaries with the foresight to see beyond the sparkle of gold  and folly of fool’s gold  to invest instead in the unmistakeable value of the tools that would actually power the gold rush  picks shovels train tracks even trains  long after the rush subsided the value of this infrastructure remained ultimately powering the westward expansion and the vibrant economies that sprouted up all the way to california  if crowdfunding markets today are the next american gold rush you can buy part of a crowdfunding portal builder or one portal host  or with an eye toward lasting value creation you could invest in the infrastructure — the picks and train tracks of today — that power those markets and will propel their growth invest fundpaas
