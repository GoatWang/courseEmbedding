frederick county now carroll county maryland and practiced law in maryland and in the district of columbia during the war of   key witnessed the british bombardment of fort mchenry in baltimore harbor the sight of the american flag still flying over the fort at daybreak inspired him to write the poem the starspangled banner which he set to the tune of an english drinking song to anacreon in heaven the starspangled banner became the official united states national anthem in  key also wrote the power of literature and its connection with religion  and poems posthumously published  every american knows the tune of the starspangled banner because every american watches sporting events some of us know the words although we cant sing it unless we are singers of special talent because of the reach of range of the notes the red glare of the rockets makes most peoples voices break and every american who knows something of history knows that frances scott key watching the bombardment of fort mchenry from the shore of baltimore harbor saw the starspangled banner flying over the fort and wrote the poem bearing that name on the back of an envelope and since then it has been our national anthem sung before baseball games starting from the last century all this history is pleasant but it is not at all true setting the record straight about our most famous flag and its anthem is the purpose of the flag the poet  the song the story of the starspangled banner dutton by irvin molotsky a fun look at an important part of american history it is important history because of the emphasis we place on our sacred flag and it is important to see how we often get that history wrong the book quite rightly goes into the war of  to show why the battle for baltimore was important the british had captured the area that eventually became chicago and detroit in april  the americans pushed vessels against toronto then called york and although the city surrendered it was subject to six days of looting and burning by the american soldiers americans were the invaders in this instance and were the bad guys as a direct result of british indignation over the way toronto had been treated the british burned the city of washington after taking it easily the white house was burned with dolley madison saving the famous gilbert stuart portrait of george washington and the declaration of independence hidden in a gristmill along with many other buildings and the seemingly invincible british moved toward baltimore along the way they arrested dr william beanes who had tried to interfere with their progress the british mistakenly thought he was a recent immigrant from scotland and wanted to try him for treason it was to free beanes that frances scott key a young lawyer living in georgetown was sent by president madison under a flag of truce the british general agreed to release beanes but would not let either him or keys go as the attack on baltimore was being readied it was thus that key was on a british ship to see the result of the bombardment of fort mchenry the huge flag thirty by fortytwo feet was not in fact the one key saw being bombed in the rain the fort flew a smaller less valuable flag now lost called a storm flag the original starspangled banner was raised in the morning key started his poem on the back of a letter but after the battle began and he was released he continued it in his hotel on better stationery his brotherinlaw was second in command at fort mchenry and caused the poem to be printed as a handbill the defence of fort mchenry not the title by which we know it someone discovered it could be sung to anacreon in heaven a jolly english drinking song whose original lyrics included and besides ill instruct you like me to intwine the myrtle of venus with bacchuss vine so perhaps it was not only a drinking song eventually around  it was adopted as the official song of the army and the navy it was not adopted as the national anthem until  and the choice was controversial critics said that the music ought to be of a more modest range so everyone could sing it and that it should not be derived from a british tune much less a drinking song since america was under prohibition most objections were about the martial lyrics which would give to millions of unknown who sing it the notion that the only real patriotism is warlike activity this and its unsingablility are objections that continue to be brought up when america the beautiful or god bless america are proposed as replacements but the anthem is secure perhaps because of the martial lyrics and the national anthem centered on the flag americans are prone to take their symbol with extreme seriousness except when using it on advertising one chapter of the flag the poet  the song deals with flagburning and the attempts to make it unconstitutional although molotsky extensively quotes patriots on both sides of the issue the most sensible words are those of general colin powell i would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants the flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunknown away finally i shudder to think of the legal morass we will create in trying to implement the body of law that will emerge from such an amendment his fellow republicans generally did not agree with him but part of our flags history might show a clearer way of looking at the issue the banner is one of only about twenty american flags from before  known to exist american flags did not become a sort of icon until the civil war the starspangled banner now under care of the smithsonian does not risk being burned but it has already suffered indignities because it flew in a preidol age it suffered from souveniring losing more than a fifth of its size to those who just wanted a little piece of it up unto the beginning of the twentieth century some icon molotskys book is largely a happy miscellany of flag and anthem lore the first documented singing of the anthem before a ball game was not until  the fans of the baltimore orioles known as the os sing until the second to last line and shout the initial syllable of o say does that starspangled banner yet wave in a manner to scare the uninitiated in atlanta home of the braves the last line is modified to oer the land of the free and the home of the braves robert goulet flubbed the lyrics in his performance before the  aliliston fight jose feliciano offended many with an eccentric rendering at a world series game in  but not as many as roseanne barr did in a deliberately bad performance in  the flag is now undergoing an  million restoration and preservation in a laboratory that visitors to the smithsonian can peer into there are plenty of enjoyable details here but the flag and anthem form an important facet of american history and public thought and molotsky has done a fine job of making the historic ideas accessible in a patriotic little
