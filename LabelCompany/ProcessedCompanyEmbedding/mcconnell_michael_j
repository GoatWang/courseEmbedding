differences  brought about by endogenous mobile element activity by idiosyncratic subchromosomal amplifications and deletions and by whole chromosome gains and losses  are hypothesized to “individualize” behavioral phenotypes to explore the causes and consequences of genetic mosaicism in neural circuits my laboratory develops highthroughput single cell approaches and employs these approaches to study human induced pluripotent stem cell hipscderived neurons as well as transgenic mice we have three immediate research goals  determine if genetic mosaicism leads to somatic selection during the development of neural circuits  understand how genetic mosaicism affects the performance of neural circuits and  discover genes that mediate the propensity for genetic mosaicism moreover altered levels of mosaicism have been associated with neurodegenerative eg ataxiatelangiectasia and neuropsychiatric disorders eg schizophrenia and rett’s syndrome a deeper understanding of these and other neurological disorders is expected from everincreasing understanding and measurement of neuronal genomic diversity selected publications search by research discipline by research

manuel siurot sn  sevilla spain tel   fax   email mcconnellmikegmailcomabstractacinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a medically important pathogen because of the increasing number of infections produced by this organism over the preceding three decades and the global spread of strains with resistance to multiple antibiotic classes in spite of its clinical relevance until recently there have been few studies addressing the factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of this organism the availability of complete genome sequences molecular tools for manipulating the bacterial genome and animal models of infection have begun to facilitate the identification of factors that play a role in a baumannii persistence and infection this review summarizes the characteristics of a baumannii that contribute to its pathogenesis with a focus on motility adherence biofilm formation and iron acquisition in addition the virulence factors that have been identified to date which include the outer membrane protein ompa phospholipases membrane polysaccharide components penicillinbinding proteins and outer membrane vesicles are discussed animal models systems that have been developed during the last  years for the study of a baumannii infection are overviewed and the recent use of these models to identify factors involved in virulence and pathogenesis is highlightedenhanced pdfstandard pdf  mb introductionacinetobacter baumannii has become an increasingly important human pathogen because of the increase in the number of infections caused by this organism and the emergence of multidrugresistant mdr strains the majority of infections caused by a baumannii are hospitalacquired most commonly in the intensive care setting in severely ill patients in addition a baumannii has emerged as a cause of infections acquired in longterm care facilities in the community and in wounded military personnel anstey et al   leung et al  scott et al  schafer  mangino  sebeny et al  sengstock et al  the types of infections produced by this pathogen include but are not limited to pneumonia both hospital and communityacquired bacteremia endocarditis skin and soft tissue infections urinary tract infections and meningitis in most cases it is thought that infections are acquired after exposure to a baumannii that persists on contaminated hospital equipment or by contact with healthcare personnel that have been exposed to the organism through contact with a colonized patient maragakis et al  crnich et al  dijkshoorn et al  asensio et al  rodríguezbaño et al  however despite the increasing clinical importance of a baumannii infections relatively little is known about the factors that contribute to its pathogenesis of the studies addressing a baumannii that have been carried out over the preceding decades the majority either describe the epidemiology risk factors and outcomes of infections caused by this bacteria or aimed to optimize antibiotic regimens for the treatment of infections produced by mdr strains while these studies provide important information regarding the epidemiology and clinical management of a baumannii infections they do not address the underlying biological basis for the increasing success of this organism as a human pathogen fortunately a number of studies have begun to address characteristics of a baumannii that may have contributed to its clinical emergence and to explain how this bacterium produces human disease on a molecular level these studies have begun to provide important insight into this important human pathogen and may reveal targets for developing novel treatment and prevention strategieshuman infections caused by a baumanniihospitalacquired pneumonia represents the most common clinical manifestation of a baumannii infection these infections occur most typically in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care setting it is thought that ventilatorassociated pneumonia caused by a baumannii results from colonization of the airway via environmental exposure which is followed by the development of pneumonia dijkshoorn et al  the crude mortality rate of ventilatorassociated pneumonia caused by a baumannii has been reported to be between  and  fagon et al  garnacho et al  although the mortality directly attributable to a baumannii infection has been the subject of controversy recently however a handful of studies and a systematic review have concluded that nosocomial infection with a baumannii is associated with increased attributable mortality falagas et al b abbo et al  falagas  rafailidis  lee et al   communityacquired pneumonia caused by a baumannii although much less frequent than nosocomial infection has also been described anstey et al   chen et al  leung et al  communityacquired pneumonia is associated with mortality rates between  and  and is often associated with underlying host factors such as alcohol abuse or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseacinetobacter baumannii is also a common cause of bloodstream infections in the intensive care setting wisplinghoff et al  the most common sources of a baumannii bloodstream infections are lower respiratory tract infections and intravascular devices seifert et al  cisneros et al  jang et al  jung et al  although wound infections and urinary tract infections have also been reported as foci of infection seifert et al  risk factors associated with acquiring a baumannii bloodstream infections include immunosuppression ventilator use associated with respiratory failure previous antibiotic therapy colonization with a baumannii and invasive procedures garcíagarmendia et al  jang et al  jung et al  inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy comorbidities neutropenia and the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation have all been associated with poorer clinical outcomes after the acquisition of a baumannii bloodstream infections cisneros et al  falagas et al a erbay et al  crude mortality rates for a baumannii bloodstream infections have been reported to be between  and  seifert et al  wisplinghoff et al  as with other types of infections caused by this pathogen the emergence of drug resistance has posed an increasing challenge to clinicians this point is illustrated by a retrospective study performed in the united kingdom between  and  in which carbapenem resistance rates rose from  in  to  in  in a baumannii isolates causing bacteremia wareham et al  in addition to clinical complications the emergence of drug resistance has also resulted in an additional economic burden on health systems lee et al  reported that bacteremia caused by mdr strains required  in additional medical costs and  additional days of hospitalization per patient compared with bacteremia with non mdr strains in a tertiary care hospital in taiwanacinetobacter baumannii is an important cause of burn infections although it can be difficult to differentiate between infection and colonization of burn sites because of the high rates of multidrug resistance and the poor penetration of some antibiotics into burn sites these infections can be extremely challenging for clinicians recent studies reporting high incidences of a baumannii infection in burn units have underscored the importance of a baumannii in this patient population albrecht et al  chim et al  keen et al a b although the prevalence of a baumannii burn site infection likely varies considerably depending on institution and geographic location acinetobacter baumannii has also emerged as an important cause of burn infection in military personnel as evidenced by a recent report characterizing bacterial infections in a military burn unit which identified a baumannii as the most common cause of burn site infection  with  of isolates demonstrating multidrug resistance keen et al b burn infection can be especially problematic as it can delay wound healing and lead to failure of skin grafts and wound site colonization can progress to infection of the underlying tissue and subsequent systemic spread of the bacteria lyytikainen et al  roberts et al  trottier et al  despite the potentially serious complications that can result from a baumannii burn infection data regarding clinical outcomes of infected burn patients do not provide a clear picture of the mortality attributable to the pathogen in this patient population a case–control study of burn patients that acquired a baumannii bloodstream infections demonstrated that infected patients had an overall mortality of  whereas uninfected controls had a mortality of  wisplinghoff et al  in contrast a retrospective cohort study found that although a baumannii was a common cause of burn site infection it was not an independent risk factor for mortality albrecht et al soft tissue infections caused by a baumannii have emerged as a significant problem in military personnel sustaining warrelated trauma in iraq and afghanistan murray et al  johnson et al  scott et al  sebeny et al  like other infections caused by this organism the treatment of these infections has been complicated by multiresistant strains skin and soft tissue infections related to war injury can produce cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis which require surgical debridement in addition to antibiotic therapy sebeny et al  to identify the source of infection in military treatment facilities scott et al  screened patient skin samples soil samples and treatment areas within the facilities for the presence of a baumannii their findings demonstrating that a baumannii was present on the skin of only one of  patients  in only one of  soil samples  but in all of the treatment areas suggest that the source of infection is within the treatment facilities separate studies assessing skin colonization have reported higher rates griffith et al  doi et al  although differences in bacterial identification methodology between studies should be taken into account as they may affect reported colonization rates in addition to military personnel skin and soft tissue infections caused by a baumannii were also identified in wounded survivors of the tsunami that occurred in southeastern asia in december of  garzoni et al  maegele et al  in the nonmilitary setting a baumannii has been reported to be a cause of surgical site infections in some institutions cisneros et al  rodríguezbaño et al  and an infrequent cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the icu setting sader et al  gaynes  edwards acinetobacter baumannii is an increasingly important cause of meningitis with the majority of cases occurring in patients recovering from neurosurgical procedures siegmanigra et al  katragkou et al  ng et al  ho et al  huttova et al  metan et al  paramythiotou et al  sacar et al  rodríguez guardado et al  krol et al  cascio et al  although rare cases of communityacquired a baumannii meningitis have been reported chang et al  taziarova et al  lowman et al  ozaki et al  clinical features of a baumannii meningitis are consistent with those of bacterial meningitis caused by other organisms and include fever altered consciousness headache and seizure rodríguez guardado et al  mortality rates associated with a baumannii meningitis are difficult to estimate because of a limited number of studies with adequately sized study populations a retrospective study identified  cases of postsurgical a baumannii meningitis in two tertiary care hospitals between  and  rodríguez guardado et al  these cases represented  of all meningitis cases at these institutions and had a crude mortality of  a similar study evaluating postsurgical a baumannii meningitis in  patients reported a crude mortality of  metan et al osteomyelitis caused by a baumannii occurs predominantly in military personnel sustaining warrelated trauma and has become as a significant problem in us military operations in iraq and afghanistan davis et al  schafer  mangino  a study describing  cases of a baumannii osteomyelitis in wounded soldiers in a military tertiary care center reported that all patients required surgical debridement of necrotic bone and that three cases were associated with bacteremia davis et al  mortality in this cohort was  although it should be noted that the young age of the patients median age  years may have contributed to the low mortality ratein addition to the abovementioned infections a baumannii is an infrequent cause of endocarditis individual case reports have described a baumannii endocarditis associated with prosthetic valves olut  erkek  menon et al  kumar et al  and intravascular catheters bhaganbruno et al antibiotic resistance contribution of genome plasticity and effect on pathogenesisthe ability of a baumannii to acquire antibiotic resistance mechanisms has allowed this organism to persist in hospital environments and has facilitated the global emergence of mdr strains especially alarming are reports describing infections caused by pandrugresistant strains with resistance to all clinically used antibiotics taccone et al  valencia et al  these strains represent a challenge for clinicians treating these infections and necessitate the development of novel strategies for preventing and treating infections caused by this organism there are a number of reviews that provide comprehensive information on antibiotic resistance mechanisms and clinical aspects of a baumannii infection chopra et al  peleg et al b vila  pachón  fishbain  peleg  gordon  wareham   the major resistance mechanisms that have been identified in a baumannii for different antibiotic classes are summarized in table table  major resistance

modificationmutations in the pmrab twocomponent system lps modification mutations in lps biosynthesis genesrecent technical and computational advances have facilitated the global genomic comparative analyses of clinical isolates and have shown the remarkable capacity of a baumannii to acquire and rearrange genetic determinants that play a critical role in its pathobiology see table  for important sequenced strains of a baumannii the first report describing this type of analysis showed that the mdr phenotype of a baumannii aye is because of the acquisition of the kb abar resistance island fournier et al  the acquisition of this island which includes  resistance genes as well as genetic traits coding for dna mobilization functions transposases and is absent in sensitive strains could be explained by horizontal gene transfer from unrelated sources other a baumannii strains such as the european clone ec ii strain acicu harbor the abar resistance island iacono et al  more recently the comparative genomewide analysis of acicu and three strains belonging to the a b and c types determined by pulsefield gel electrophoresis isolated during an outbreak at the national institutes of health clinical center snitkin et al  confirmed the presence of discrete genomic regions dedicated to antimicrobial resistance this report also showed that a baumannii has the capacity to adapt to hospital environments not only by horizontally acquiring genetic traits responsible for the evolution of nonmdr ancestors into mdr outbreak strains but also by rearranging preexisting genes acinetobacter baumannii strains can shuffle add andor delete genes coding for important virulence factors particularly those associated with cellsurface products such as surface proteins and oantigens and adhesins and the expression of the functions needed to acquire essential nutrients such as iron snitkin et al  taken together these observations indicate that nonmdr strains may serve as a source of antigenic variants that could play a critical role in the diversification and emergence of mdr a baumannii clinical isolates such a possibility is supported by a recent report imperi et al  showing that a baumannii has a relatively smallsized core genome and a rather large accessory genome that hosts numerous antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants and is likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer processestable  important sequenced strains of acinetobacter baumannii and associated iron uptake systemsstrainsystemfehemeahemebcluster cluster acinetobactincluster cluster  the  and −

virulence of a baumannii a colistinresistant strain isolated after growth of a colistinsensitive strain in subinhibitory concentrations of colistin showed decreased in vitro and in vivo growth compared with the parental strain lópezrojas et al  additionally the ld of the colistinresistant strain was fold higher than the parental strain in a mouse model of intraperitoneal sepsis targeted gene sequencing showed that the colistinresistant strain had acquired a mutation in the pmrb gene a mechanism that has previously been described to confer resistance to colistin adams et al  a separate study in which the fitness and virulence of an a baumannii strain in which ciprofloxacin resistance was induced by growth in the presence of ciprofloxacin was compared with the parental strain showed similar results smani et al  the ciprofloxacinresistant derivative induced less cell death reduced in vitro and in vivo growth and reduced mortality in a mouse model of peritoneal sepsis taken together these studies indicate that at least in some cases the acquisition of antibiotic resistance in a baumannii comes at a biological costnatural habitats of a baumanniiaccording to the current taxonomy the genus acinetobacter includes  valid species jp euzéby taxonomy site httpwwwbacteriocictfraacinetobacterhtml the most recent addition of acinetobacter indicus sp nov malhotra et al  and nine provisional species based on dna–dna hybridization all of which encompass strains found in a wide range of ecological niches however the most medically relevant species belong to the a baumannii complex which includes a baumannii and the genomic species  and tu which were recently renamed acinetobacter pitti sp nov and acinetobacter nosocomialis sp nov respectively nemec et al  because of the widespread presence of acinetobacter in different ecological niches one of the main misconceptions regarding the natural habitat of a baumannii is its ubiquitous presence in nature and consequent isolation from water animal and soil samples reports describing these types of isolations should be carefully considered particularly if they refer to strains that were not identified to the species level according to the current taxonomy using validated methods which are more accurate than those used some time ago especially before  when the taxonomy of the genus underwent major revisions bouvet  grimont  equally misleading is the concept that a baumannii is a normal component of the human flora on the basis of the ecology epidemiology and antibiotic phenotype of different isolates towner proposed the existence of three major acinetobacter populations towner  one of them which consists mainly of a baumannii and closely related members of the a baumannii complex is represented by strains isolated from medical environments and equipment medical personnel and hospitalized patients in general these isolates tend to be resistant to multiple antibiotics although strains such as the clinical isolates atcc t and atcc  which are sensitive to most antibiotics clearly belong to this group the second population is represented by strains that can be found in human and animal skin flora as well as in spoiled food samples members of this group include acinetobacter johnsonii acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter radioresistens the last group includes antibioticsensitive isolates obtained from environmental sources such as soil and wastewater samples and mainly comprises acinetobacter calcoaceticus and a johnsonii although most members of the these last two groups are sensitive to antibiotics some a radioresistens a johnsonii and a calcoaceticus isolates have been found to contain carbapenemase resistance genes figueiredo et al  while this grouping makes sense considering the current understanding of the taxonomy epidemiology and ecology of different members of the acinetobacter genus the fact that strains such as atcc t which is the a baumanniitype strain bouvet  grimont  and atcc  which was the first to be fully sequenced smith et al  are sensitive to most if not all antibiotics used in human medicine may at first glance contradict the existence of these groupsthe ability of a baumannii to resist desiccation and persist on hospital materials and medical devices villegas  hartstein  has played a critical role in the emergence of this bacterium as a relevant human pathogen however many host environmental and bacterial factors affecting the virulence phenotype of a baumannii remain to be identified and characterized for example it was observed that exposure of a baumannii to ethanol enhances not only its growth in media containing ethanol but also serves as an environmental signal that controls responses to salt tolerance and increased pathogenicity when tested in caenorhabditis elegans smith et al  further genomic and mutagenesis analysis of the strain atcc  showed that the enhanced ethanolmediated virulence response in c elegans worms and dictyostelium discoideum amebae relates to genes located in pathogenicity islands some of which code for novel gene products smith et al  interestingly some of the mutants harbor mutations impairing the expression of abc transporters an uncharacterized urease activity and transcriptional regulators the latter finding suggests that ethanol could play a global regulatory function a hypothesis that is supported by the data obtained using global rnasequencing camarena et al  this study which resulted in the identification of  ethanolinduced genes coding for metabolic functions stress responses and virulence functions suggests that ethanol affects the pathobiology of a baumannii such findings could be significant because the presence of ethanol in clinical settings may have an impact as previously reported edwards et al  more recently it was reported that a baumannii also senses and responds to light an unexpected observation considering that this is a nonphotosynthetic microorganism mussi et al  this observation led to the hypothesis that the outcome of certain infections such as surfaceexposed wound infections could depend on the exposure of bacteria to light and temperatures lower than  °cadherence and biofilm formation appear to contribute to pathogenicityacinetobacter baumannii has a remarkable capacity to survive and prosper in hospital environments most likely due to its ability to interact with different types of surfaces including abiotic substrata normally found in medical

to survive long stretches of time under highly desiccated conditions on abiotic surfaces a property that is uncommon among other gramnegative pathogens wendt et al  jawad et al  acinetobacter baumannii also adheres to and colonizes indwelling devices such as catheters and respiratory equipment villegas  hartstein  as well as biotic surfaces such as those of human epithelial cells fig a which may be a target during respiratory infections or candida albicans filaments fig b lee et al  the latter type of interaction could represent the capacity of a baumannii to interact with other

belonging to the ec ii strain are more adherent than the ec i strain to human bronchial epithelial cells although no significant differences were observed between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains lee et al generally the adherence of a baumannii to biotic and abiotic surfaces results in the development of biofilms which are complex multicellular threedimensional structures with cells in intimate contact with each other and encased in an extracellular matrix that can be comprised of carbohydrates nucleic acids proteins and other macromolecules costerton et al  it is hypothesized that a baumannii persists in medical environments resists antimicrobials and causes disease because of its capacity to form biofilms on solid surfaces donlan  costerton  gaddy  actis  some a baumannii clinical isolates form complex biofilm structures on the surface of liquid media which are known as pellicles fig  martí et al  mcqueary  actis  pellicle formation and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are quite variable among a baumannii clinical isolates with no apparent correlation between the nature of different types of substrata and bacterial surface properties mcqueary  actis  furthermore there are significant variations not only in the amount of biofilm formed on abiotic surfaces but also in the type of cell arrangements formed on these surfaces some cell arrangements are simple monolayers of bacteria attached in an organized or random manner while others are complex multilayered structures encased within a biofilm matrix mcqueary  actis figure  open figuredownload powerpoint slidescanning electron microscopy of acinetobacter baumannii pellicle collected on the surface of a coverslip figure from the laboratory of luis actisa number of a baumannii gene products have been shown to play a role in biofilm formation and adherence to abiotic surfaces initial studies showed that pilus production mediated by the csuababcde usherchaperone assembly system is required for attachment and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces by the a baumannii atcc t strain tomaras et al  this operon seems to be widespread among clinical isolates an indication that the pili assembled by this system could be a common factor among different clinical isolates however the atcc t strain has the capacity to produce alternative pili that may participate in the interaction of this pathogen with bronchial epithelial cells de breij et al  preliminary observations cn mcqueary  la actis unpublished results also indicate that a baumannii atcc  has pili that are different from those described in the atcc t strain the atcc  pili are long and thin and they tend to bundle this observation is congruent with the fact that atcc  cells do not produce csuab which is considered the pilin subunit of the csuababcdemediated pili and with the fact that this strain forms much weaker biofilms on plastic when compared with the atcc t strainin strain  mutational loss of a large outer membrane protein which has high similarity to the staphylococcal biofilmassociated protein bap resulted in a diminishment of the volume and thickness of biofilms formed by this strain on glass loehfelm et al  on the basis of its cellular location and participation in biofilm formation and development the bap protein which is conserved among different clinical isolates appears to be needed for celltocell interactions that support biofilm development and maturation loehfelm et al  the two latter processes also depend on the capacity of a baumannii clinical isolates to produce and secrete polyβnacetylglucosamine pnag an exopolysaccharide produced by almost all tested strains that is critical for the formation of fully developed biofilms on glass by cells cultured statically choi et al in the atcc t strain a twocomponent regulatory system comprised of a sensor kinase encoded by bfms and a response regulator encoded by bfmr is involved in bacteria–surface interactions tomaras et al  insertional inactivation of bfmr resulted in a loss of expression of the csuababcde operon and the ensuing lack of pili production and biofilm formation on plastic when cells were cultured in rich medium tomaras et al  inactivation of the bfms sensor kinase gene resulted in a diminishment but not abolishment of biofilm formation when the bfmrs system was not expressed the composition of the culture medium still influenced the interaction of cells with abiotic surfaces tomaras et al  this indicates that bfmr could crosstalk with other sensing components and suggests that multiple and different environmental stimuli could control biofilm formation via the bfmrs regulatory pathwayin contrast to the ability to adhere to abiotic surfaces much less is known regarding the a baumannii factors that play a role in adherence to and biofilm formation on biotic surfaces as mentioned above this pathogen attaches to human epithelial cells and c albicans filaments in a process that involves at least the outer membrane protein ompa while ompa could also play a role in biofilm development on plastics this outer membrane protein is critical for the interaction of the pathogen with human and candida cells when the latter are in a filamentous form gaddy et al  the atcc tc albicans filament interactions are independent of the pili assembled by the csu usherchaperone system and lead to apoptotic death of the fungal filaments fig  these results suggest that there is no direct correlation between biofilm formation on abiotic and biotic surfaces and that there is wide variation in the cellsurface and cell–cell interactions that result in adherence and biofilm formation by different a baumannii clinical isolates in spite of this information the role of pili in bacterial virulence and the pathogenesis of the infections a baumannii causes in humans remains to be confirmed using appropriate derivatives and experimental infection modelsfigure  open figuredownload

actisadherence and biofilm formation are wellorchestrated processes that respond to a wide range of cellular and environmental cues stanley  lazazzera  for instance the ability of a baumannii to form biofilms could depend on the presence and expression of antibiotic resistance traits such as the blaper gene a positive correlation was found between the presence and level of expression of this gene and the amount of biofilms formed on plastic and the adhesiveness of bacteria to human epithelial cells lee et al  however an independent study found that only two of  isolates carrying the blaper gene formed stronger biofilms when compared with isolates lacking this genetic determinant rao et al  which brings to question the relevance of the presence and expression of this gene in biofilm formation by a baumannii isolates environmental cues such as temperature and the concentration of extracellular free iron which are relevant for the interaction of a baumannii with the host also affect the amount of biofilm formed by this pathogen on abiotic surfaces acinetobacter baumannii atcc t formed more biofilm when cultured in lb broth at  °c or in m minimal medium at  °c in the presence of the synthetic iron chelators ′dipyridyl dip or ethylenediaminediohydroxyphenyl acetic acid eddha tomaras et al  however a global transcriptomic analysis later showed a significant downregulation of some of the csu genes in cells cultured under ironchelated conditions eijkelkamp et al  this apparent discrepancy might be explained by the fact that these two studies used different strains atcc t vs atcc  in atcc  cells the csu operon does not appear to be active and ironregulated cell products other than pili may play a role in adherence and biofilm formation mcqeary zimbler and actis unpublished observations the chelating agent edta also affects the interaction between clinical a baumannii isolates with biotic and abiotic surfaces as it has been shown that it significantly reduces bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on human respiratory epithelial cells and plastic surfaces lee et al  the molecular mechanisms by which these chelators produce this effect remain to be elucidatedcell population density is another mechanism by which bacteria control adherence and biofilm formation accordingly environmental and clinical isolates produce quorum sensing signaling molecules gonzález et al   interestingly these studies showed that a large proportion of the tested isolates produce one or more quorum sensors that seem to belong to three types of molecules although none of these sensors could be assigned to a particular species the rftype sensor is more frequently found in isolates belonging to the a calcoaceticusbaumannii complex more detailed studies showed that the a baumannii m clinical isolate produces an nacylhomoserine lactone ie nhydroxydodecanoylhomoserine lactone ohchsl the product of the abai autoinducer synthase gene which is important for the formation of fully developed biofilms on abiotic surfaces niu et al  this autoinducer also plays a role in the ability of this strain to move on semisolid media as described in the next section finally as mentioned above the observation that light affects biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces was unexpected considering that a baumannii is a chemotroph not known to conduct photosynthesis mussi et al  this response is mediated by the blsa photoreceptor protein which contains a bluf domain and uses fad to sense light the mechanisms by which blsa transduces the light signal and controls gene expression are not known mussi et al  the a baumannii response to light seems to have a global effect on the physiology of a baumannii affecting not only biofilm formation but also motility and virulence furthermore the differential response to illumination is modulated by temperature changes which result in differential transcription of blsa at  and  °c and hence differentially affect lightcontrolled phenotypes mussi et al in conclusion biofilm formation and adherence in a baumannii clinical isolates involves a range of bacterial factors and multiple signals or cues however the medical relevance of data obtained using in vitro models is not clear considering the lack of correlation between the biofilm phenotype of different clinical isolates and their outbreak epidemic and antibiotic resistance nature de breij et al  by comparison with other bacterial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa very little is known about the a baumannii products involved in pathogenicity mechanisms and the cellular and environmental signals that control them within the vertebrate hostmotility on semisolid surfaces does it impact on pathogenicitymotility in a baumannii is counterintuitive considering that the name of this genus acinetobacter nonmotile bacterium implies the inability of members of this genus to move however this phenotype was reported more than  years ago when henrichsen described the influence of the environment on the ability of a calcoaceticus to move on agar plates henrichsen  henrichsen  blom  this issue recently resurfaced because of the observation that a baumannii displays differential motility in response to illumination mussi et al  quorum sensing clemmer et al  and iron chelation eijkelkamp et al  although the type of motility displayed by acinetobacter strains has not been elucidated unequivocally current phenotypic and genetic evidence suggests that this pathogen moves on semisolid surfaces by expressing twitching motility rather than gliding sliding swimming or swarming motility barker  maxted  henrichsen  eijkelkamp et al  this possibility is supported by the observation that iron affects motility and the expression of pilcom atcc  genes eijkelkamp et al  that participate in the assembly and function of type iv pili which are known to be involved in twitching motility mattick  furthermore insertional inactivation of pilt which codes for an atpase activity involved in pilus retraction in other bacteria merz et al  mattick  resulted in a significant reduction in the motility of the a baumannii m strain clemmer et al  however a piltkm derivative of strain m was still motile on the surface of  eiken agar suggesting that the strain has type iv piliindependent motility functions such a possibility is supported by the reduced motility of m transposon insertion derivatives affected in the expression of genes that do not code for type iv pilus assembly and function clemmer et al  sequence analysis of some of these derivatives showed the potential involvement of a lipopeptide degradation of peptidoglycan synthesis of oantigen ompa and the histidine kinase sensor bfms which regulates the expression of the csuababcde operon via the bfmr response regulator tomaras et al most if not all movement displayed by a baumannii occurs on the surface of semisolid media and diminishes as the concentration of agar or agarose in the medium increases clemmer et al  mcqueary  actis  furthermore different types of agar affect the outcome of the motility response with complex patterns that manifest as either welldefined brunches with some of them resembling ditching motility already described in acinetobacter anitratus barker  maxted  or circular cell expansion from the inoculation point with an even pattern of cells on the surface of the agar clemmer et al  mcqueary  actis  different strains display different patterns and not all tested strains move on semisolid surfaces fig  clemmer et al  mcqueary  actis  currently we do not know whether motility depends on different motility systems or variations in the capacity of different strains to sense the appropriate environmental cues controlling this complex multicellular process for instance the availability of free iron which is well known for its impact in bacterial human infections weinberg  plays a role in the pilcomdependent motility of a baumannii as mentioned before eijkelkamp et al  cell population density is another factor that controls motility as inactivation of the abai gene specifying the autoinducer ohchsl resulted in a drastically reduced motility response which was corrected by the supplementation of purified autoinducer clemmer et al  light particularly blue light is a third environmental signal that controls a baumannii motility on semisolid media by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated mussi et al figure  open figuredownload powerpoint slidesurface motility of acinetobacter baumannii strains on semisolid media suspensions of bacteria containing the nonmotile atcc t strain a and three clonally distinct clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii b–d were deposited on the center of plates containing  agar and allowed to grow at  °c for  h figure from the laboratory of jerónimo pachónin conclusion a baumannii is capable of moving on the surface of semisolid media by processes that are mediated at least in part by type iv pilidependent mechanisms which are affected by environmental and cell signals that also affect bacterial virulence however it is unclear whether motility plays a significant role in the virulence of a baumannii and the pathogenesis of the serious infections that it causes in the human host this is because not all clinical isolates display motility when tested under laboratory conditions which undoubtedly do not reflect those encountered by this pathogen in the human host and because appropriate nonmotile isogenic derivatives have not been tested in relevant animal modelsiron acquisition from heme and via siderophoresalthough iron is abundant in environmental and biological systems ferric iron is relatively unavailable to cells because of its poor solubility under aerobic conditions and its chelation by lowmolecularweight compounds such as heme and by highaffinity ironbinding proteins such as lactoferrin and transferrin in response to iron limitation most aerobic bacteria express highaffinity iron acquisition systems that mainly include the production export and uptake of fe chelators known as siderophores in addition some bacteria utilize heme or hemoglobin as an iron source and some are able to remove iron from transferrin or lactoferrin crosa et al  wandersman  delepelaire  acinetobacter baumannii does not bind transferrin echenique et al  and does not carry genetic determinants coding for the proteins involved in the acquisition of iron from transferrin and lactoferrin smith et al  however the atcc t strain uses heme as an iron source zimbler et al  the chromosomal cluster annotated as asas in strain atcc  seems to be a polycistronic operon that could be involved in the transport of heme from the periplasm into the cytoplasm smith et al  a more recent genomic analysis antunes et al a showed that different strains can use this compound as an iron source expressing potential heme uptake and utilization systems table  taken together these observations indicate that the a baumannii genome contains genes coding for products devoted to the capture and utilization of heme a host product that could be available to bacteria at sites where extensive cell and tissue damage are produced by infections such as necrotizing fasciitis brachelente et al  charnotkatsikas et al  corradino et al  or in severely injured patients peleg et al b acinetobacter baumannii may also acquire ferrous iron table  which would be available under lowoxygen tension conditions because fully sequenced and annotated genomes show the presence of genes coding for a feo transport system antunes et al a the function of which remains to be tested experimentallyacinetobacter baumannii is also capable of acquiring ferric ions under ironlimited conditions via siderophores the bestcharacterized system is that mediated by the siderophore acinetobactin which was initially described in the atcc t strain and has a molecular structure highly related to anguibactin fig  a highaffinity iron chelator produced by the fish pathogen vibrio anguillarum  yamamoto et al   dorsey et al  mihara et al  the main difference between these two siderophores is that acinetobactin contains an oxazoline ring derived from threonine while anguibactin has a thiazoline group derived from cysteine in spite of this difference these siderophores which are produced by two unrelated bacterial pathogens found in different environments are also functionally related because both of them crossfeed derivatives affected in their production dorsey et al  genetic and functional analyses dorsey et al  mihara et al  have shown that a kb chromosomal region harbors genes coding for all functions needed for the biosynthesis transport and secretion of acinetobactin with the exception of enta which codes for the biosynthetic enzyme dihydrodihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase this enzyme is needed for the production of the dihydroxybenzoic acid dhba moiety present in the acinetobactin molecule fig  this observation indicates that a baumannii could contain more than one locus involved in siderophore biosynthesis a possibility that is supported by the recent information made available by genomic analysis of fully sequenced and annotated a baumannii isolates table  antunes et al a eijkelkamp et al  the report by eijkelkamp et al  describes five gene clusters predicted to be involved in siderophore production and utilization for iron acquisition the kb cluster mentioned above related to acinetobactin which was named as the acinetobactin cluster and cluster  are present in the genomes of all strains analyzed with the exception of  and the environmental strain acinetobacter baylyi adp table  cluster  is present only in a baumannii atcc  and a baylyi adp while cluster  seems to be unique to isolate  cluster  is found in all genomes analyzed except that of atcc  and adp  it is

acinetobactin and anguibactin siderophores produced by acinetobacter baumannii and vibrio anguillarum respectively the dhba and nohhistamine moieties are common to both siderophore molecules the oxazoline ring derived from threonine and the thiazoline ring derived from cysteine are unique to acinetobactin and anguibactin respectively the dhba moiety derives from chorismic acid by the action of the entaentb and entc enzymes while the nohhistamine component is the result of the decarboxylation of histamine crosa  walsh  mihara et al taken together the available experimental and in silico observations indicate that a baumannii can acquire iron either by using heme as an iron source or by capturing this metal with acinetobactin andor one or more additional siderophoremediated systems a recent report by gaddy et al  showed that the acinetobactinmediated system plays a critical role in the ability of a baumannii atcc t to persist and cause cell damage and animal death when tested using human epithelial cells galleria mellonella caterpillars and mice infection models indicating that iron acquisition functions play a critical role in virulence whether the other iron acquisition systems listed in table  also play a virulence role or provide an ecological advantage for their persistence in particular ecological niches are interesting possibilities that remain to be examinedvirulence factorscompared to other gramnegative pathogens relatively few virulence factors have been identified for a baumannii the recent sequencing of numerous a baumannii complete genomes

that a baumannii ompa contributes to virulence was obtained in a random transposon mutagenesis screen that detected a baumannii mutants that were deficient in inducing apoptosis in a human laryngeal epithelial cell line choi et al  purified ompa localized to the mitochondria and induced apoptosis through the release of the proapoptotic molecules cytochrome c and apoptosisinducing factor suggesting that this may be one pathway by which a baumannii induces damage to human airway cells during infection the ompa protein also plays a role in adherence and invasion of epithelial cells may contribute to the dissemination of a baumannii during infection as the bacterial loads in blood of mice with experimentally induced a baumannii pneumonia were significantly higher in mice infected with a wildtype strain than in mice infected with an equivalent amount of an isogenic ompa mutant choi et al  the ompa protein also contributes to the ability of a baumannii to persist and grow in human serum as it has been shown that ompa interacts with soluble inhibitors of the alternative complement pathway and allows the bacteria to avoid complementmediated killing kim et al  however ompa is unlikely to be the only factor that contributes to serum resistance as different a baumannii strains all of which contain putative ompa genes have significantly different capacities for growth and survival in human serum antunes et al b as mentioned before in the environment ompa may also facilitate the persistence and survival of a baumannii by assisting biofilm formation and surface motility gaddy et al  clemmer et al  because of the multiple functions of ompa in the pathogenesis of a baumannii it may be an attractive target for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategiesacinetobacter baumannii lps contains a lipid a moiety the carbohydrate core and the repetitive oantigen the role of lps in a baumannii pathogenesis was recently investigated using a mutant lacking the lpsb glycotransferase that results in a highly truncated lps glycoform containing only two carbohydrate residues bound to lipid a luke et al  this mutant showed decreased resistance to human serum and decreased survival in a rat model of soft tissue infection compared with the isogenic parent strain indicating a role for the surface carbohydrate residues of lps in pathogenesis it has also been demonstrated that cd and tolllike receptor  play a role in clearing a baumannii from the lung through detection of lps knapp et al  suggesting that a baumannii lps activates the innate immune response studies further addressing the inflammatory response and the mortality elicited by lps mutants in animal models would be of interest for further characterizing the contribution of a baumannii lps to virulencethe structures of the capsular polysaccharides from two clinical isolates of a baumannii were recently reported revealing a linear aminopolysaccharide consisting of three carbohydrate residues in one strain and a branched pentasaccharide in the other fregolino et al  in addition to lps the capsular polysaccharide has also been identified as a pathogenicity factor in a baumannii mutants that were deficient for growth in human ascites fluid because of transposon insertion in the ptk or epsa gene failed to produce a capsulepositive phenotype these mutants showed decreased growth in both human serum and ascites compared with the wildtype counterpart additionally capsuledeficient strains were completely cleared by  h postinfection in a rat model of soft tissue infection whereas the isogenic parental strain persisted with   bacteria ml− of exudative fluid russo et al  thus the capsular polysaccharide appears to play an important role in protecting bacteria from the host innate immune responsebacterial phospholipases are lipolytic enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of phospholipids these enzymes are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of gramnegative bacteria by aiding in the lysis of host cells via cleavage of phospholipids present in the host cell membrane and by degrading phospholipids present at mucosal barriers to facilitate bacterial invasion disruption of one of the two phospholipase d genes present in a baumannii genome resulted in reduced survival in serum and a reduced capacity for invading epithelial cells jacobs et al  in addition in a murine model of pneumonia mice infected with the phospholipase ddeficient strain had lower bacterial burdens in the heart and liver at  h postinfection than mice infected with the parental strain suggesting that phospholipase d contributes to the ability of a baumannii to disseminate from the lungs the a baumannii genomes sequenced to date also demonstrate the presence of two putative phospholipase c genes and culture supernatants from different a baumannii strains contain phospholipase c activity indicating that these genes are expressed and the resulting proteins are secreted from the bacterial cell antunes et al b in a separate study inactivation of one of the phospholipase c genes resulted in a modest decrease in the ability of the mutant strain to induce cell death in an epithelial cell line compared to the parental strain camarena et al penicillinbinding proteins pbps are most commonly associated with binding to and inactivating βlactam antibiotics however pbps also participate in the final steps of the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer and thus contribute to bacterial cell stability sauvage et al  an a baumannii mutant with a transposon insertion in the pbpg gene which encodes the putative lowmolecularweight penicillinbinding protein pbp demonstrated reduced growth on ascites plates russo et al  while this mutant grew similarly to its wildtype counterpart in laboratory media it showed reduced growth in human serum and decreased survival both in a rat model of soft tissue infection and a mouse model of pneumonia thus the mutant had reduced fitness in conditions that mimic the environment encountered by the bacterium during the infectious process electron microscopy of the mutant and wildtype strains showed a difference in bacterial morphology supporting the idea that a lack of pbp may affect cell stability possibly via effects on the peptidoglycan layer russo et al outer membrane vesicles omvs are vesicles secreted from the outer membrane of various gramnegative bacteria and consist of outer membrane and periplasmic proteins phospholipids and lps omvs have been reported to participate in bacterial virulence by delivering virulence factors to the interior of host cells to facilitate horizontal gene transfer and to protect the bacteria from the host immune response ellis  kuehn  multiple strains of a baumannii secrete omvs during growth in vitro kwon et al  jin et al  mcconnell et al b rumbo et al   a proteomic analysis of purified a baumannii omvs identified the ompa protein as well as putative proteases and a putative hemolysin as potential virulence factors moreover omvs could deliver ompa to the interior of eukaryotic cells and induce cell death exposure of cells to omvs isolated from an ompadeficient strain did not produce cell death jin et al  interestingly omvs were also able to facilitate the horizontal transfer of the oxa carbapenemase gene indicating that omvs may play a role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance in a baumannii rumbo et al animal models of a baumannii infectionas with most bacterial diseases experimentation in animals is necessary for characterizing both the invading pathogen and the host response animal models provide a means for evaluating novel treatments characterizing the host immune response and identifying bacterial virulence factors in the first report describing an animal model for a baumannii infection a mouse model of acute pneumonia was described jolyguillou et al  since this report the number of animal models used for characterizing a baumannii infection has multiplied allowing the study of various types of infectious pathologies in a wide range of animal species including rodent nonrodent and even nonmammalian models of infection these studies have begun to yield information about a baumannii biology and its interaction with the hosta major challenge in the use of animal models to characterize infectious pathologies is to accurately mimic human disease although it is unrealistic to expect that infection of laboratory animals which in many cases are inbred strains can completely reproduce the human disease process efforts should be made to simulate these conditions as closely as possible an important aspect to consider when employing an animal model of a baumannii infection is the selection of the animal strain in the case of mouse models of a baumannii infection a number of inbred strains of mice have been employed including cbl balbc and aj strains these strains although they are likely to give a more homogeneous response to infection may not accurately reflect the variable response that likely occurs in humans it is worth noting that a number of outbred strains of mice such as cd and swiss webster mice have been successfully used in models of a baumannii infection jolyguillou et al  braunstein et al  crandon et al  koomanachai et al  song et al  the animal strain employed can also dramatically affect the outcome of infection for instance individual mouse strains have different susceptibilities to infection with a baumannii which can result in significant differences in survival tissue bacterial load clinical signs inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine response jolyguillou et al  qiu et al a for these reasons the effect of the animal strain employed should be carefully considereda second important aspect that should be considered is the a baumannii strain that will be employed in an animal model although welldefined sequenced strains of a baumannii are available from the american type culture collection eg atcc t and atcc  see table  their clinical background and epidemiology are unknown for animal studies it may be more appropriate to use more recently isolated strains that have known clinical relevance for example strains belonging to the european clones i–iii the majority of studies performed using animal models have employed uncharacterized clinical isolates for which there are often few epidemiological and microbiological data making the generalization of results difficult this point is illustrated by the fact that in mouse models of a baumannii infection the virulence of individual strains can vary widely in these models the use of different strains resulted in significant differences in mortality tissue bacterial load histological score and inflammatory cytokine levels eveillard et al  mcconnell et al a these findings underscore the importance of strain selection which would ideally include strains with proven potential to cause infections and spread epidemically in addition once a tentative virulence trait has been identified in a reference strain ideally studies using large collections of welldefined strains should be performed to assess the prevalence of this trait in clinically relevant isolatespneumonia models of infectionstudies employing animal models of a baumannii pneumonia have overwhelmingly employed mice presumably because of their low cost and ease of handling the mouse pneumonia model has been used to measure a number of variables related to infection such as mortality tissue bacterial load cytokine levels in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum inflammatory cell infiltration into the lung and histological score in the majority of models developed to date pneumonia is produced either through direct instillation of a bacterial suspension typically containing between  and  cfu into the trachea or by intranasal instillation of the inoculum for intratracheal instillation a technique developed for inducing pneumonia with haemophilus influenzae has been employed esposito  pennington  animals are suspended vertically and the bacterial suspension is instilled with a microliter syringe using a blunttipped needle jolyguillou et al  rodríguezhernández et al  correct positioning of the needle in the trachea is confirmed by localizing the tracheal cartilage with the tip of the needle after instillation of the bacterial suspension animals are maintained in a vertical position to facilitate inoculation of the lower airways for intranasal inoculation a bacterial suspension is applied to the nares of anesthetized mice and inhaled knapp et al  van faassen et al  crandon et al  qiu et al a b jacobs et al  while most studies employ intratracheal or intranasal infection an oral inoculation technique for a baumannii has recently been described in which a bacterial suspension was instilled in the oral cavity and the nares were completely blocked to facilitate inhalation of the inoculum koomanachai et al there is no evidence supporting the idea that one inoculation technique intratracheal vs intranasal more accurately reproduces human disease than the other it could be argued that the intranasal technique may more closely mimic the clinical situation in which a patients upper airway is colonized before producing pneumonia and however there is no literature support for this presumption in animal models of pneumococcal pneumonia the intranasal route produces a bronchopneumonia whereas the intratracheal route results in a lobar pneumonia azoulaydupuis et al  canvin et al  however these results have not been confirmed in the case of a baumannii models in mice both routes of infection produce an acute pneumonia that is accompanied by an increase in inflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs and histological changes consistent with pneumonia jolyguillou et al  knapp et al  qiu et al a eveillard et al  both intratracheal and intranasal infection have been reported to produce mortality in mice the bacterial and mouse strains used as well as whether or not the animals were rendered neutropenic prior to infection can influence the level of mortality jolyguillou et al  braunstein et al  van faassen et al  crandon et al  qiu et al a eveillard et al because of the low virulence of most a baumannii strains in mice and for this reason the high infection doses that must be used to establish infection a number of studies have employed neutropenic mouse models of pneumonia to facilitate infection jolyguillou et al   wolff et al  braunstein et al  crandon et al  koomanachai et al  song et al  eveillard et al  yuan et al  to induce transient neutropenia mice are treated with cyclophosphamide usually in two doses starting  days before infection the first description of the neutropenic model in chhn mice reported weight loss in the infected animals bacterial growth in the lungs and  mortality between days  and  jolyguillou et al  studies employing the neutropenic mouse model have almost exclusively had the objective of characterizing antibiotic efficacy however a recent study used this model to compare the virulence of different clinical isolates of a baumannii eveillard et al  the authors report that mortality and tissue bacteria load varied depending on the infecting strain a caveat is that the neutropenic mouse model may not accurately reproduce some features of infection in nonneutropenic patients as neutrophils play an important role in the early stages of a baumannii infection in mice van faassen et al a commonly used alternative to rendering mice transiently neutropenic is the use of porcine mucin in the inoculum in these models the cultured bacteria are mixed with porcine mucin typically to a final concentration of  mucin before instillation of the inoculum into the lungs rodríguezhernández et al   montero et al   pachónibañez et al   beceiro et al  chiang et al  pichardo et al  mucin has long been known to increase the virulence of numerous bacterial species in mouse models olitzki  its use thus allows for the number of bacteria in the inoculum to be reduced dramatically in some cases by as much as fold for some bacterial species batson et al  although the presence of mucin during the establishment of infection has no role in human infection the use of lower amounts bacteria in the inoculum followed by bacterial growth and the development of pneumonia may more accurately mimic human disease than the rapid instillation of large quantities of bacteria into the lung porcine mucin has been used exclusively with the intratracheal route of infection likely due to the difficulty of administering a viscous solution via the intranasal routein a mouse pneumonia model that did not require the induction of neutropenia or the use of porcine mucin aj mice were more susceptible to intranasal infection with the atcc  strain of a baumannii than were cbl mice qiu et al a b an inoculum of  ×  bacteria in saline produced  mortality by day  postinfection infection of the aj strain resulted in reduced early neutrophil infiltration into the lung lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines ilβ mip and tnfα increased bacterial replication and increased extrapulmonary dissemination compared to cbl mice qiu et al athe mouse pneumonia model has recently been employed for characterizing host factors involved in respiratory infections the availability of transgenic mice with welldefined genetic changes has facilitated the characterization of these factors to the molecular level mice deficient in cd and tolllike receptors  and  have been used to characterize the role of these molecules in respiratory infections knapp et al  this study concluded that cd and tolllike receptor  play a role in clearing a baumannii from the lung through detection of lps while tolllike receptor  appears to downregulate the immune response to a baumannii pulmonary infection another study characterizing the role of nadph phagocyte oxidase in pulmonary infection showed that mice lacking the gene encoding this enzyme had higher postinfection bacterial loads and increased mortality after infection demonstrating the importance of the neutrophil response in controlling a baumannii infection in mice qiu et al balthough the overwhelming majority of animal models of a baumannii pneumonia have employed mice models using other species have been developed to study the biology of this pathogen during pulmonary infection a rat pneumonia model previously used to characterize escherichia coli respiratory infection has been adapted for the study of a baumannii russo et al  in this model long evans rats are anesthetized before surgical exposure of the trachea and instillation of the inoculum into the trachea via a needle infected rats demonstrated many characteristics that mimic human infection including bacterial growth in the lung decreased arterial oxygenation as assessed by paofio increased cytokine levels tnfα ilβ and cinc in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid neutrophil infiltration and mortality one advantage of the rat model is that because of their larger size rats can be infected via direct instillation of the inoculum into the trachea which may increase the reproducibility of infection by ensuring that the entire inoculum is instilled into the airways it should also be noted that the rat model described by russo et al  did not require the use of porcine mucin or the use of animals that had been rendered transiently neutropenic prior to infection a guineapig model of pneumonia was developed to characterize the efficacy of antibiotic combinations in the treatment of mdr a baumannii bernabeuwittel et al  this model uses an inoculation technique similar to that described above for inducing pneumonia in rats in that the inoculum is instilled directly into the surgically exposed trachea via a needle however in contrast to the rat model the inoculum contained  porcine mucin to increase the virulence of the infecting strain histopathological studies of infected lungs demonstrated that infection produced acute inflammation and resulted in neutrophil infiltration into the peribronchial and perivascular spaces lung bacterial loads  h postinfection in untreated animals receiving an inoculum of approximately  ×  were between  ×  and  ×  cfu g− lung tissue and mortality at this time point was between  and  depending on the a baumannii strain used bernabeuwittel et al skin and soft tissue infection modelsboth mouse shankar et al  dai et al  deleon et al  thomasvirnig et al  and rat uygur et al  models of a baumannii burn infection have been developed in these models a nonlethal fullthickness burn is produced on the dorsal surface of the anesthetized animal after shaved skin is either submerged in a heated water bath or exposed to preheated metal blocks infection is subsequently initiated either through topical application or subcutaneous injection of a solution containing a baumannii at the burn site the objective of the studies employing the burn model has exclusively been to evaluate the efficacy of different experimental treatments for this reason the most common parameter measured in these studies is the bacterial concentration present at the burn site in addition to measuring bacterial concentrations at the burn site some studies have also measured bacterial loads at different anatomical sites underlying muscle lung and blood and survival shankar et al  dai et al  uygur et al  because of the fact that these studies aimed to evaluate treatment efficacy there are few data available regarding the host response to burn infection by a baumanniianimal models for studying soft tissue infection by a baumannii have predominantly employed two distinct techniques for initiating infection the first technique involves injection of a solution containing a baumannii directly into the thigh muscle this approach has been used in mice to measure tissue bacteria loads in the muscle after treatment dijkshoorn et al  and in a neutropenic rat model in which survival and bacterial loads in distant organs were measured pantopoulou et al  in the neutropenic rat model bacteria disseminated to distant organs lung liver and spleen and infection produced  mortality at  days in untreated control mice suggesting that this model results in sepsis secondary to infection of the thigh muscle a variation on this model is the implantation of filter paper impregnated with a suspension of a baumannii in muscle via a surgical incision fetiye et al  these approaches have been used to evaluate the efficacy of treatments on a baumannii infection and no data regarding the host response or the bacterial factors involved in the pathogenesis of the infection were reportedthe second approach used for producing soft tissue infection utilizes the formation of a subcutaneous pouch to mimic the formation of an abscess russo et al  in this model a subcutaneous space is produced on the dorsal surface of an anesthetized rat by injection of air the space is then filled with  ml of an oil mixture and the rats are maintained for  days to allow for the accumulation of exudative fluid which is then inoculated with the desired quantity of bacteria  ×  cfu it has been reported previously that this model results in neutrophil infiltration indicating that the response to infection is similar to that seen during natural infection dalhoff et al   an advantage of this model is that the pouch fluid can be repeatedly sampled at different time points allowing for continuous measuring of bacterial concentrations and the host response while both inoculation techniques appear to share some characteristics with human infection it is not clear how well these models mimic soft tissue infection produced by traumatic injury further study characterizing the host response to infection in these models will help to provide insight into this issueanimal models of sepsiscompared to pneumonia and burn and soft tissue infection models relatively few models of a baumannii sepsis have been developed in the first model of sepsis a bacterial suspension is administered intraperitoneally in balbc mice ko et al  this approach produced mortality between  and  with an inoculum of approximately  ×  cfu of a clinical isolate more recently a similar model has been employed to characterize the efficacy of vaccines for preventing infection by a baumannii mcconnell  pachón  mcconnell et al a and to evaluate the effect of antibiotic resistance on virulence and fitness lópezrojas et al  and the role of the acinetobactinmediated iron uptake system in virulence gaddy et al  in this model the bacterial inoculum is first combined with porcine mucin to a final concentration of  before intraperitoneal instillation to increase the virulence of the infecting strain allowing for the use of inocula containing fewer bacteria in this model different a baumannii strains had widely varying ld values up to an fold difference in the strains tested suggesting that this model can be used to characterize the virulence of different isolates after intraperitoneal instillation of the inoculum bacteria rapidly disseminated to distant organs spleen kidney and lung with bacterial loads in these tissues reaching approximately  ×  cfu g− of tissue at  h postinfection serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines tnfα ilβ and il were elevated after infection consistent with the cytokine storm produced during the development of septic shock bacteria continued to reproduce in distant organs until death occurred between  and  h depending on the strain used for infection and the number of bacteria in the inoculum importantly  mortality was obtained by  h after infection with  ×  cfu of the atcc t strain mcconnell et al a because of the high mortality that can be reproducibly achieved with relatively small inocula compared to mouse pneumonia models this model is also convenient for the use of vaccine efficacy studies in a rat model of a baumannii sepsis the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens has been determined cirioni et al  similar to the mouse model of sepsis the inoculum is injected intraperitoneally however without the addition of porcine mucin in this study bacterial loads in the blood peritoneum spleen liver and mesenteric lymph nodes were measured in addition to plasma endotoxin and cytokine levels infection resulted in  mortality  h after infection although it should be noted that a high inoculum was used  ×  cfu which may not be physiologicthe advantages of the animal models of sepsis developed for a baumannii are a facile inoculation procedure high mortality and the possibility of measuring tissue bacterial loads in multiple organs in addition these models share some important aspects with human sepsis including high serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines bacterial dissemination and high mortality however an obvious difference between these sepsis models and the human disease process is the source of infection intraperitoneal instillation of the inoculum produces sepsis that is secondary to intraperitoneal infection which does not represent a natural route of infection in a baumannii disease this approach rapidly produces fulminant sepsis in mice and rats whereas in human disease the development of a baumannii sepsis is typically more progressive this aspect may complicate studies aiming to characterize the host response during the early phases of a baumannii sepsis it is worth noting that a number of the models described above for the study of pneumonia burn and soft tissue infections have been shown to result in disseminated infection rodríguezhernández et al  montero et al  pantopoulou et al  shankar et al  dai et al  uygur et al  these models may therefore better mimic clinical scenarios in which sepsis results from dissemination of the infection from a discrete infectious focusother mammalian models of a baumannii infectionpachónibañez et al  have recently reported the development of a rabbit model of a baumannii meningitis in this model anesthetized rabbits are immobilized in a stereotactic frame and the inoculum is instilled into the intracisternal space the authors report that features of meningitis in the cerebrospinal fluid developed by  h postinoculation bacterial loads lactate dehydrogenase concentrations and white blood cell counts were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid after obtaining the sample by cisternal puncture in addition brain edema was quantified by determining brain weight after desiccation a major advantage of this model is that the large size of rabbits allows for repeated sampling of the cerebrospinal fluid for monitoring the evolution of meningitis in a single animala rabbit endocarditis model has been described for a baumannii that was developed based on a model initially used for characterizing staphylococcal endocarditis perlman  freedman  rodríguezhernández et al   in this model an intracardiac catheter is inserted into the left ventricle of new zealand rabbits  days prior to inoculation for the establishment of infection mice are inoculated via injection of a suspension containing a baumannii into an ear vein the authors report that  of control rabbits were bacteremic  h postinoculation and that a baumannii was isolated from the valves of all infected animals valve bacterial loads and valve sterility rates in addition to quantitative blood cultures were used to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic regimensthere have been two reports describing the development of animal models of a baumannii osteomyelitis in a mouse model osteomyelitis can be produced by surgically exposing the tibia and inserting a mm stainless steel pin that has been coated with a suspension of a baumannii into the bone metaphysis crane et al  this approach produces a chronic but nonlethal osteomyelitis the authors used histology to show that a baumannii resulted in osteoblastic bone formation at the site of infection in contrast to staphylococcus aureus that produces an osteolytic response an attempt to produce osteomyelitis in rats has been made by inoculating induced segmental bone defects with a baumannii collinetadler et al  the authors report that in this model the bacteria were cleared without producing a clinically relevant osteomyelitis although bony lysis and new bone formation were detected in some animalsnonmammalian models of a baumannii infectionmammalian models of a baumannii infection allow characterization of a host response to infection similar to that found in human infections in addition because drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be determined in mammalian species using techniques similar to those used in humans these models also permit the study of antibiotic regimens for the treatment of a baumannii infection for these reasons models based on mammalian species clearly have advantages for study designs that aim to mimic the human disease process however recently developed nonmammalian models of infection offer the advantage of lower cost for both purchasing and maintaining the animals and avoidance of ethical issues that are associated with the use of mammalian species table  in addition nonmammalian models because of the ease of infecting large groups may be more suitable

dictyostelium discoideumsurvival melanization egg count plaque formationidentification of virulence factors interactions with eukaryotic cells galleria mellonella is the larval stage of the greater wax moth and it has recently been developed for use as model for infection by a baumannii peleg et al  in this model caterpillars are inoculated with a suspension containing a baumannii via injection into the caterpillar hemocoel postinfection mortality was shown to depend upon the number of bacteria present in the inoculum as well as the active expression of the acinetobactinmediated iron acquisition system gaddy et al  in addition infection of the caterpillars with a baylyi and acinetobacter lwoffii which are thought to be less pathogenic in humans produced less mortality than infection with an inoculum containing an equal amount of a baumannii together these data may suggest that this model can be used to characterize the virulence of different strains treatment of infected caterpillars with antibiotics that had activity against the a baumannii strain in vitro increased survival indicating that this model may also be useful for evaluating antibiotic efficacycaenorhabditis elegans is an unsegmented nematode that feeds on bacteria two reports have used c elegans to characterize a baumannii smith et al  used an assay in which worms are placed onto lawns of a baumannii and the proliferation and brood sizes of the worms are measured with this approach these authors identified  a baumannii mutants that supported growth of the worms on ethanolcontaining media which has been reported to increase bacterial virulence smith et al  a subsequent study demonstrated that a baumannii reduced the ability of c albicans to kill c elegans during coinfection demonstrating that this model can be used to study eukaryote–prokaryote interactions peleg et al adictyostelium discoideum is an ameba that is found in soil environments and has recently been used to measure the virulence of a baumannii mutants smith et al  in this model d discoideum is cocultured with a baumannii and because of the slower growth rate of the amebae a baumannii produces a lawn in which plaques are formed because of the consumption of the bacteria by d discoideum bacteria with increased virulence or bacteria grown under conditions that increase the expression of virulence traits results in a reduction in the number of plaques formed by d discoideum conversely if the virulence of a strain is reduced for example by the introduction of a mutation an increase in the number of plaques formed by the ameba is seen this model was successfully used to identify a baumannii transposon mutants with reduced virulence smith et al concluding remarkswith the increasing clinical importance of a baumannii because of a rise in the number of colonizationsinfections caused by this organism and the emergence of mdr strains continued study of this pathogen is required the use of animal models has already yielded important data regarding the optimization of antibiotic regimens for the treatment of resistant strains and has begun to identify virulence factors that have contributed to the success of a baumannii as a pathogen with the sequencing of multiple a baumannii genomes and the increasing availability of transgenic animals it is hoped that these models can be used to continue to identify bacterial and host factors involved in infection at the molecular and cellular levels these studies will provide insight into the basic biology of this important human pathogen and aid in the identification of targets for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategiesacknowledgementsthe authors thank pilar pérezromero for critical
