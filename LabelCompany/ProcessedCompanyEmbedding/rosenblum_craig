suite review by craig rosenblum sales and marketing  it central station sign inhelp desk software » agiloft service desk suite » reviewagiloft service desk suite reviewits customizable can be developed easily and free but only up to a certain number of users linkedintweet itimprovements to my organization this product has provided us with a tool to perform a successful trial with our customer and receive their stamp of approval to move beyond the trial phase because this product is infinitely customizable and easily developed we are using it for other applications use of solution  days deployment issues none stability issues this is actually interesting their model is that the software is basically free to a point based on number of users we developed a functioning product and it ran on their test server without a hiccup  scalability issues for our application the product has scaled perfectly customer service excellent they provide free support for  days for free software  seriously technical support excellent previous solutions we tried and paid for the interneer intellect bpm solution we experienced too many problems which challenged our confidence in the product to move forward even after we paid for it we felt that we would be better off abandoning the intellect product and going with another solution  implementation team we developed it ourselves inhouse in  weeks we had a usable solution  cost and licensing advice this is a great question because this is an area of diversity due to the nature of bpm the workflow and processes will change and improve over time which will require modifications to the software for this reason it makes sense to be able to do it inhouse i would recommend that you try either the agiloft product or the bonitasoft product because you can develop them without a fee to a point to see if it is right for you the product that we paid for upfront the interneer intellect solution doesnt seem to have the same capabilities or latest technology look and feel as the free version other solutions considered intellect bonitasoft disclosure i am a real user and this review is based on my own experience and opinionsjul
