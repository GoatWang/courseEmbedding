redemption by the issuer the issuer notifies gkb via a central industry depository of the number of units for the specific security to be redeemed upon receipt of the issuer’s notification gkb determines the favorability of the redemption based on the current market price versus the call price when the redemption of the callable security is made on terms that are favorable to the called parties gkb does not include any firm or employee accounts in the pool of securities eligible to be called until all other customer positions in such securities have been called when the redemption is made on terms that are unfavorable to the called parties gkb does not exclude firm or employee accounts from the pool of the securities eligible to be called once the favorability of the redemption has been determined gkb uses a random process designed to allocate called securities on a fair and impartial basis the lottery process is based on a mathematical formula that determines the accounts that will be selected and the number of securities in the account that will be redeemed general terms  conditions general terms  conditions terms of useyou are currently viewing a page of the

risk disclosures investor  fixed income risk disclosuresinvestor – fixed income risk disclosures investing in any security involves risk and exposes the investor to potential losses on their investment different investment products and strategies involve different degrees of risk fixed income investments have a number of different risks that potential investors should be aware of in order to make an informed assessment as to whether the investment meets their risk profile the following is a list of potential risks for of investing in fixed income securities call or prepayment risk call risk refers to the potential for an issuer to repay a bond before its maturity date something that an issuer may do if interest rates decline  much as a homeowner might refinance a mortgage loan to benefit from lower interest rates bond calls are less likely when interest rates are stable or moving higher many municipal bonds are callable so investors who want to hold a municipal bond to maturity should research the bonds call provisions before making a purchase investors in mortgagebacked securities are subject to prepayment risk – as interest rates move higher prepayments will generally decline as the underlying mortgages become less likely to prepay this extends the average life of the mortgage pool and increases the expected duration of the bond which may cause a decline in the current market value for the security even small changes in rates can have significant implications from a market value perspective investors with shorterterm liquidity needs or who do not have the ability to hold the securities to maturity may experience unanticipated lossescredit risk this is the risk that the bond issuer may experience financial problems that make it difficult or impossible to pay interest and principal in full the failure to pay interest or principal is referred to as default credit ratings are available for many bonds credit ratings seek to estimate the relative credit risk of a bond as compared with other bonds although a high rating does not reflect a prediction that the bond has no chance of defaultinginterest rate or duration risk bonds have a fixed face value known as the par value if bonds are held to maturity the investor will receive the face value amount back plus interest that may be set at a fixed or floating rate the bonds market price will move up as interest rates move down and it will decline as interest rates rise so that the market value of the bond may be more or less than the par value us interest rates have been low for some time if interest rates move higher investors who hold a low fixedrate municipal bond and try to sell it before it matures could lose money because of the lower market value of the bond in that environment duration is a measurement of a bonds sensitivity to interest rates changes the higher the duration of a bond generally the maturity or expected maturity of a bond the larger the impact on the change in value when interest rates move up or down higher duration bonds carry more interest rate risk than lower duration bonds for additional information about interest rate risk the msrb has highlighted the impact of market interest rate movements on bond prices and yields on their website the impact of market interest rate movement on municipal bond prices and yields inflation risk inflation is a general upward movement in prices inflation reduces purchasing power which is a risk for investors receiving a fixed rate of interest it also can lead to higher interest rates and in turn lower market value for existing bonds liquidity risk this refers to the risk that investors wont find an active market for the taxable or municipal bond potentially preventing them from buying or selling when they want and also preventing them from obtaining a certain price for the bond many investors buy taxable and municipal bonds to hold them rather than to trade them so the market for a particular bond may not be especially liquid and quoted prices for the same bond may differ tax implications consider consulting a tax professional to discuss the bonds tax implications including the possibility that your bond may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax or eligible for state income tax benefits there is also a risk that the us tax laws may change in the future thereby increasing or decreasing the value of municipal bonds margin disclosure statement margin disclosure statementmargin disclosure statementgeorge k baum  company is furnishing this information to you to provide some basic facts about purchasing securities on margin and to alert you to the risks involved with trading securities in a margin account before trading stocks in a margin account you should carefully review the margin agreement please contact us regarding any questions or concerns you may have with your margin accounts when you purchase securities you may pay for the securities in full or you may borrow part of the purchase price from the firm if you choose to borrow funds from the firm you will open a margin account with the firm the securities purchased are the firms collateral for the loan to you if the securities in your account decline in value so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan and as a result the firm can take action such as issue a margin call andor sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with the firm in order to maintain the required equity in the account it is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin these risks include the following  you can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account a decline in the value of securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to the firm that has made the loan to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities or assets in your accounts the firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your accounts if the equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements or the firms higher house requirements the firm can sell the securities or other assets in any of your account held at the firm to cover the margin deficiency you also will be responsible for any short fall in the account after such a sale the firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you some investors mistakenly believe that a firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid and that a firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has contacted them first this is not the case most firms will attempt to notify their customers of margin calls but they are not required to do so however even if a firm has contacted a customer and provided a specific date by which the customer can meet a margin call the firm can still take necessary steps to protect its financial interests including immediately selling the securities without notice to the customer you are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your accounts are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call because the securities are collateral for the margin loan the firm has the right to decide which security to sell in order to protect its interests the firm can increase its house maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice these changes in firm policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call your failure to satisfy the call may cause the member to liquidate or sell securities in your accounts you are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call while an extension of time to meet margin requirements may be available to customers under certain conditions a customer does not have a right to the extension privacy policy privacy policy privacy summarygeorge k baum
