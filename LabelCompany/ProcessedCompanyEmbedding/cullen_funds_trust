letter we pointed out that once the back of a meltup market is finally broken there eventually follows a long period of outperformance by value stocks however when an extended meltup ends speculation and momentum do not suddenly stop instead what happens is a period of extreme volatility and erratic stock market behavior which usually takes the market to new highsdownload pdfmarket outlook everyone is underweighted in valuejan  jan   market outlook everyone is underweighted in valuemarket history shows that applying a low pe value discipline to stock selection has rewarded investors with such powerful longterm results it seems inconceivable that they can be underweighted in the strategy the reason is that in a meltup market like the one we just experienced growth stocks and index funds increasingly get bid up over value stocks as the market becomes less and less concerned about risk and valuation however once a meltup market ends a period follows where value dramatically outperforms for a long time below you can see how year after year value outperformed the passive sp  index following two other similar extreme meltup periodsdownload pdfmeltup market updateoct  oct

it becomes and this was one of the most extended in the past  yearsdownload pdfmid year commentsjun  jun   mid year commentsthe meltup market now the third longest recovery without a  correction in the last  years continues to roll along dangerously we have now reached a point in the market where risk is being increasingly ignored by many investors evidence for what is going on can be seen in the pe multiples of some popular stocks facebook at x earnings netflix at x twitter at x and amazon at x to name a few more evidence of an extended market lies in what happened in the first quarter of this year when the most speculative stocks with no dividends dramatically outperformed the more conservative dividendpaying stocksdownload pdfthe nature of the beastjan  jan   the nature of the beastin the interview that summarized his  years in the investment business ben graham was asked for his opinion of the professionals on wall street his answer was that most of the stockbrokers financial analysts and investment advisors etc are aboveaverage in intelligence business honesty and sincerity but they lack adequate experience with all types of security markets and an overall understanding of common stocks he called this the nature of the beast which is the natural emotionallydriven instinct to buy high and sell lowdownload pdfthe five year plansep  sep   the five year planin our last market letter we pointed out that  million invested in the sp  in  would have become  million by  over the same period of time investing that same  million using a pe discipline would

last  months in such an environment investing with a price discipline is ignored if not completely forgotten as a result stocks like facebook and twitter have become market darlings despite having meager or no earnings what we have is reminiscent of the meltup markets of the s the s and the late s in which it became ever more difficult for disciplined investors to outperform the market even the

spend most of our careers coping with negatives such as recessions inflation wars government shutdowns etc the opposite is much less common  a meltup market  which is what we have now a meltup market is one that moves up for at least  days without a  correction such a market tends to develop in periods like we have been examining in recent market letters where we noted that one of the most powerful longterm drivers of stock prices is a massive shift of money from bonds and cash into stocks after stocks reach record low levels of ownershipdownload pdfmid year commentsjul  jul   mid year commentsrecently market commentators have questioned whether the dividend trade is too crowded and overdone we believe that the guessing and worry are misplaced because the high dividend strategy is a long term investment approach and not about trading granted the chase for yield has driven up the price of many high dividend stocks however one of the main features of the strategy is applying a

approachdownload pdf outlookjan  jan    outlookin what might be called a relief rally the stock market sailed through january showing strength not many expected its unclear whether the election results or the quick fix for the fiscal cliff will have any positive effect on the economy but at least investors are relieved that both are behind us one definite benefit to the market was holding

turnwhat history shows investors is that once the stock market is up over  after a major bear market the back of the bear has been broken and a new recovery phase has begun the tricky part is that history also shows investors that the period just after the turn is usually quite irrational as panicky short covering and trading related to it become the main drivers of the market the result is

bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
