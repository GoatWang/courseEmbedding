marketing experience at leading companies including cendant corporation homestorecom digital insight and conagra foods doohan is currently employed as director web services on the corporate marketing services team at conagra foods in this role he develops and manages internet strategy for corporate and consumerfacing websites manages the marketing community on the company’s portal and directs targeted marketing efforts to the company’s consumer database imedia how has the media mix changed for you over the last few years is online still an afterthought or are campaigns for the most part conceived of in an integrated fashion from the get go or are you somewhere in between doohan online is becoming more integrated as time goes on i joined the team in january  to increase focus on our online efforts and to counsel our leading brands and the corporation on how to best integrate online into our marketing mix imedia what was your most successful online or integrated campaign recently and what made it successful  doohan our most successful campaign was one where we marketed consistently over time to a group of customers who subscribed to branded newsletters early results and analysis indicate that consumer purchasing behavior did change after they subscribed to and received the product newsletters what made the promotion successful was the creation and distribution of relevant content consistently over time to consumers who had expressed an interest in receiving it imedia what is the greatest benefit of online advertising the ability to measure precisely target gather data something else  doohan all of these benefits are important but the most immediate benefit of online advertising is the ability to gather data learning about what our customers say they want and what they do is critically important to our marketing effort we can inexpensively and quickly gather information from our online customers imedia what still frustrates you most about online advertising what can be done to improve the situation doohan im still sometimes frustrated by the lack of focus on roi in terms of selling product image and awareness changes are fantastic but they need to be tied to sales of more product at higher prices to truly grow the business imedia are you doing any behavioral targeting if yes please describe doohan we do some targeting of newsletter and promotional content to users based on their responses to registration andor survey questions we are not currently buying any ads or displaying dynamic content to web users based on their surfing behaviors imedia are you being affected by any consumergenerated marketing cgm  blogs user groups etc are you using any blogs or other social networking tools to market doohan were not currently using blogs we follow some on occasion because bloggers are passionate about their topics and often represent the feelings of groups of passionate users we have to consider the source carefully and confirm hypotheses with other sources when making assumptions based on blog comments imedia have you found agencies to be able to handle your changing interactiveintegrated needs what could still be better doohan were happy with our agencies to date challenges are traditional agency challenges project management billing staff turnover et cetera imedia have you done much with wireless itv or other emerging mediums doohan no imedia its the beginning of a new year what do you hope to accomplish this year doohan we will continue to refine our ability to measure roi of online spends based on incremental product sales generated we will also improve and better integrate our web presence as a whole across our strong stable of brands and our corporate sites imedia what are you reading these
