fundamentals with a link to see more most recent earnings figures are based on nongaap income from continuing operations market cap capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares it is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares for example a publicly held company with  million shares outstanding that trade at  each would have a market capitalization of  million shares outstanding common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the q or k pe ratio latest closing price divided by the earningspershare based on the latest month eps change ltm of earnings companies with negative earnings receive an ne eps the basic annual eps from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for example if a company has  million in net income and  million in outstanding shares then its eps is  beta  month beta coefficient that measures the volatility of a stocks returns relative to the market sp  it is based on a month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the sp  earnings the amount of latest earnings per share eps paid out to shareholders dividend yield a portion of a companys profit paid to shareholders quoted as the dollar amount each share receives dividends per share yield is the amount of

digits growth ratemaximizing the value of pcb bu and fitcontinue improving profits by rafi amit ceo of camtek nasdaqcamt our strategic focus ahead is primarily the semiconductor business we will aim to double semiconductor revenue in  years through a combination of both organic growth and ma at the same time we intend to maintain our strong position in the pcb market and maximize the value of this business unit we also aim to complete the development of our fit technology for solder mask in the coming  to  months and subsequently find a strategic partner for readers who want to know more about camtek i would like to spend some time giving you a background to what we do about us camtek is a nasdaq and tel aviv listed company under the ticker camt its headquarters are in israel and hong kong with offices and subsidiaries in us europe singapore china korea taiwan and japan we are a microcap technology company with a market cap of around   million and net cash position of about  million we are profitable having reported a ltm last twelve months up to and including q  nongaap net income of  million on ltm revenue of  million we have a strong position in one of the fastest growing segments of the semiconductor equipment space and therefore we are growing ahead of the semiconductor industry in general based on analysts expectations of continued growth in the industry in  which will be driven by consumer spending and in particular on mobile devices and smarter cars as part of our strategy we plan to further expand our business with our existing customers and penetrate new customers we expect doubledigit growth in our  revenues from the semiconductors division we predict our operational leverage is likely to lead to improved margins in  due to the fact that we will increase our revenue in our core business and limit our expense in the digital printing nysefit project in fact any fairly intelligent electronic device that we may use today whether it is a mobile device a laptop a car or a camera contains semiconductors and pcb components which are very likely to have been checked or more accurately optically inspected by one of our machines during the manufacturing process these devices are becoming ever more complex and compact and therefore the components inside increasingly require inspection before integration this underlying increase together with the general growth in consumer sales of smart devices drives growth in our industry as a whole within our target markets we are a well known supplier of inspection equipment directly competing with rudolph nasdaqrtec ati toray and others on the semiconductor side and orbotech nasdaqorbk and small asian companies on the pcb side our customer base includes  out of top  semiconductor manufacturers as well as the majority of the worlds largest pcb manufacturers customers include names such as ti and sony nysesne as well as major manufacturers such as tsmc nysetsm and samsung which manufacture the processors that power the majority of todays smartphones our customers are diversified with none greater than  of full year revenues we primarily build and sell automated optical inspection and metrology systems called aoi for short our systems use advanced image processing software as well as advanced electrooptics and precision mechanics in which  years of rd has been invested we also invest m per year in a future technology related to applying solder mask digitally on pc boards we call it fit functional inject technology actually we develop a dedicated ink inkjet printer and process our main target market for this technology is the automotive industry this industry is interested in adopting digital technology for solder mask application and the inject technology is the only practical alternative we believe we can introduce turnkey solution to the market in q  automated optical inspection enduser customers expect all advanced product to perform perfectly with no room for defects as a result all leading companies that sell their devices insist on a zero defect criteria they demand all their suppliers inspect each component and guarantee shipping for only the good parts moreover todays microchips or pcbs are an integration of very many different components and sub systems one tiny fault in one small part will cause the entire device to fail every part needs to be checked individually accurately and quickly before assembled into a bigger subunit this ensures the manufacturer has a higher production yield sellable products out of the total manufactured and lower costs from rejects we target two main markets in the electronic packaging industries and the electronics supply chain  the semiconductor fabrication industry as well as  the pcb industry and we will take a look at the potential for camtek in each the semiconductor business the semiconductor manufacturing industry produces the microchips which provide the functionality of the many smart devices we use today this industry has generally performed well over the past few years this has been driven by consumers continuing to buy the greatest and latest phones laptops tablets cameras wearables led lighting iot devices tvs and now semiautonomous smart cars among others our semiconductor business has been our growth engine over the past several years and is likely to be for the coming few years driven by ongoing consumer demand for increasingly complex electronic devices our semiconductor inspection business has grown from  million in revenues in  to an expected  million in  the reason for this premium growth rate over the industry is because we serve the fastest growing segments of the semiconductor industry and our innovative technology and leading position has allowed us to penetrate almost all the leading manufacturers some of which until recently we had not penetrated before thus moving into  camteks customer base is the broadest it has even been in the semiconductor sector which gives us the ability to grow further by selling more systems into our customer base our semiconductor systems are used by manufacturers for various inspection and metrology applications for inspecting the finished semiconductor wafers for defects such as cracks foreign materials or damage to measuring features and sizes on finished dies such as the bumps coplanarity and critical dimension the eagle is our flagship system for the semiconductor industry camteks latest aoi system for semiconductors we focus on the fastest growth segments of our target markets and we are well positioned in this segments for half a century moores law named after intel cofounder gordon moore generally held true just over fifty years ago he observed that transistors were shrinking so fast that every two years twice as many could fit onto a chip in the past few years there has been a slowing in moores law as it is becoming more difficult to shrink logic down in a costeffective way for production therefore the industry has shifted to looking for cleverer ways of improving chip efficiencies in a given existing node size ie given the current chip transistor or gate dimensions advanced packaging segment advanced packaging is now one of the fastest growing segments in the semiconductor this is a area where we leverage both our semiconductor experience as well as our pcb experience in the past tiny wires attached the integrated circuits ics in the microchip wire bonding to the substrate on which the chip sits which was then mounted on the pcb printed circuit board the integrated circuits that are manufactured under an advanced packaging technology are connected via what is literally a rectangular array of metallic bumps this is a much more efficient technology with improved power consumption and speed a picture below bumps on an integrated circuit camteks systems detect any missing misplaced or deformed bumps and checks that these bumps conform to shape and height specifications any slight size shape or placement deviations may cause damage to the integrated circuit or the substrate during the packaging process leading to a full device failure each wafer potentially has several million bumps that need to be inspected and measured and inspection is crucial to the manufacturing process because of our unique experience and technology we are seen by our customers as having the most advanced d measurement tools for this sector while todays most advanced chips are indeed manufactured this way only about  of all wafers produced are currently bumped which means there is significant room for further growth in this market sector in fact analysts expect the advanced packaging penetration to accelerate over the coming few years approximately half of all our semiconductor systems are sold to support this fastest growing segment in the market and we believe that this sector will continue to gain further sales traction in the coming year micro electro mechanical systems another fast growing segment where we have focus on is that of microelectro mechanical systems nasdaqmems which mainly serves the mobile and automotive markets utilizing materials manufacturing technologies and facilities from the semiconductor industry to produce miniature mechanisms these might be inkjet print heads accelerometers video projection devices microphones medical devices to manipulate cells and other tiny parts the mems manufacturing segment relies very heavily on testing to ensure reliability and this testing is a significant amount of the overall product cost for mems inspection is implemented at a number of stages along the manufacturing process to detect damage as well as to confirm dimensional conformity for mems inspection strongly increases yield and lowers waste and overall production costs we are seeing continued strong interest in this segment and we intend to broaden our sales to our customers in this segment in  a mems gear cmos image sensors nysecis another area in which we have a strong lead and an area growing well ahead of the semi space in general is the complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensors cis or what is better known as the chip which powers a camera akin to the human retina in the eye for a number of years now these chips have been increasingly used in mobile devices as well as automotive security products and other computer vision applications comparing the picture quality or resolution from a phone even just one or two generations ago with the quality gained today it is quite clear how fast the cis chip technology is improving this market is continuously increasing the number of pixels per each sensor to improve resolution while reducing the size of each pixel which requires the manufacturing process to have a high resolution inspection for every sensor a cmos image sensor in a smartphone we built our lead by focusing on specially developed capabilities to address specific pixel requirements and we intend to further increase our market share in all the main cis manufacturers globally with our systems the pcb inspection business our pcb inspection business is and has been a solid and cash flow generating business for many years in this segment we focus on selling to the highend pcb manufacturers and our customers include the majority of the top global manufacturers this business generates around  million per year in revenues a pcb or printed circuit board supports and interconnects a broad range of electronic components and enables them to operate as an electronic system pcbs consist of traces or lines of conductive material laminated on a base which provide electrical interconnections between the components the trace integrity and conformance to exact dimensions are essential to the correct functioning of the electronic product smart phones tablets and the like are driving the trend towards much more compact highperformance and highly reliable electronic products this drives the demand for increased complexity including multiplelayer pcbs and miniaturization with increasingly thin and dense lines today multilayer boards consist of several layers of circuitry laminated together to form a single board with both horizontal and vertical electrical interconnections between the boards pcb of the apple watch the traces being internal and components attach to the pads on the top and a simpler one layer pcb from earlier times which were checked by human eyes at that time today the latest pcbs can use conductive lines and spaces of as little as  to  µm for high density pc board and  to  micron for standard pc board in addition the number of inner layers in typical multilayer pcbs usually ranges from  to  and up to  layers inspection by aoi looks for defects in the inner layers prior to the lamination process once the multilayer board is laminated any undetected defect in any specific layer will result in discarding the entire board as the manufacture of pcbs becomes ever more complex we see increased demand drivers for aoi during manufacture which should drive camteks pcb segment in the coming years looking ahead  was a record year for us and based on our guidance for q expecting between  million in q revenue camtek will have shown solid revenue growth in the year  and even more so in the semiconductor segment  while the pcb segment has been and remains very stable the semiconductor industry as a whole continues to show promising growth trends into  beyond that though we believe that we can continue to grow ahead of our end markets sector driven by our focus on growing market segments as well as increasingly penetrating existing manufacturers and selling to new customers moreover while operating margins have averaged in the  range in the past few years camtek expects this to improve the expected improvement is as a result of some of the savings from the reorganization of the digital printing activity as well as from the leverage in the business in light of the expected revenue growth this will enable us to increase our profits in the quarters ahead hence moving into  camtek has a lot of wind in its sales and i look forward to the ongoing and strong growth in semiconductor revenue with the potential for improved profitability disclosure camt is a member of
