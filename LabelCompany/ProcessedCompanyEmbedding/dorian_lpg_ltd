exports hit new records in the first four months of  offsetting declines in middle eastern volumes and increasing ton mile demand we believe that the overall trend for us exports remains positive and lpg volumes will grow well above those of last year the low us propane inventories have likely been one of the main reasons lpg prices have remained firm relative to west texas intermediate crude prices with the current excess in crude stocks and weakening crude prices margins on natural gas liquids are expected to improve and the production of natural gas liquids to show growth increasing propane stocks in the process india lpg imports registered a  yearoveryear growth during calendar year  a testament to the indian governments commitment to replacing kerosene in households with lpg neo panama canal lpg traffic continues to be very strong with lpg vessels representing  of the total traffic volume the panama canal authority has announced a toll increase effective october  which will hike rates by about  and will likely impact traffic levels and arbitrage margins if fuel oil prices remain reasonably low longer voyages around the cape of good hope may become profitable again and result in ship supply tightness and freight rate improvements canadian lpg exports are expected to benefit from the neo panama canal toll increases improving competitiveness of canadian lpg exports with freight cost savings and higher netbacks to propane producers in western canada the order book stands at about  of the vlgc fleet while the over yearold vlgc vessels constitute  of the fleet we maintain our thinking that stronger demolition prices and new environmental regulations will make older vlgc vessels more attractive demolition candidates with lpg export terminals well established and lpg becoming less freight constrained more attention will turn to the management of the lpg growth in the receiving and distribution infrastructures the above market outlook update is based on data derived from industry sources and there can be no assurances that such trends will continue or that anticipated developments in freight rates export capacity export volumes scrapping rates or other market indicators will materialize seasonality liquefied gases are primarily used for industrial and domestic heating as a chemical and refinery feedstock as a transportation fuel and in agriculture the lpg shipping market is typically stronger in the spring and summer months in anticipation of increased consumption of propane and butane for heating during the winter months in addition unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and the supply of certain commodities demand for our vessels therefore may be stronger in our quarters ending june  and september  and relatively weaker during our quarters ending december  and march  although month time charter rates tend to smooth these shortterm fluctuations to the extent any of our time charters or the charters of the vessels in the helios pool expire during the relatively weaker fiscal quarters ending december  and march  it may not be possible to recharter the vessels at similar rates as a result we and the helios pool may have to accept lower rates or experience offhire time for the vessels which may adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results

unrealized gainloss on derivatives realized loss on derivatives stockbased compensation expense impairment and depreciation and amortization and is used as a supplemental financial measure by management to assess our financial and operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to

depreciation and amortization and loss on disposal of assets expense which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net incomeloss between periods we believe that including adjusted ebitda as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in use and should not be considered an alternative to net incomeloss operating income cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda excludes some but not all items that affect net incomeloss adjusted ebitda as presented below may not be

of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was owned calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period  we define available days as calendar days less aggregate off‑hire days associated with scheduled maintenance which include major repairs drydockings vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys we use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues  we define operating days as available days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off‑hire for any reason other than scheduled maintenance we use operating days to measure the number of days in a period that our operating vessels are on hire refer to  below  we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during that period an increase in non‑scheduled off‑hire days would reduce our operating days and therefore our fleet utilization we use fleet utilization to measure our ability to efficiently find suitable employment for our vessels  tce rate is a nongaap measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel tce rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period‑to‑period changes in a shipping companys performance despite changes in the mix of charter types such as time charters voyage charters under which the vessels may be employed between the periods our method of calculating tce rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period which may not be calculated the same by other companies the

addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap we provide adjusted net incomeloss and adjusted eps we believe that adjusted net incomeloss and adjusted eps are useful to investors in understanding our underlying performance and business trends  adjusted net incomeloss and adjusted eps are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under gaap therefore

 industry what is lpg liquefied petroleum gas lpg is a fossil fuel made during natural gas processing and oil refining two thirds of the lpg people use is extracted directly from the earth the rest of it is manufactured indirectly from crude oil refining chemically lpg is a mixture of two flammable but nontoxic gases called propane and butane how is lpg stored lpg is liquefied in a tank or bottle in order to have more and take up less space if you could see inside an lpg tank or bottle youd see a liquid not a gas thats because the propane and butane have been compressed so they take up almost  times less space than normal by comparison the air in a typical car tire is pressurized to roughly – times normal air pressure—so the gas in an lpg tank is squeezed about  times more lpg takes up relatively little space compared to the actual amount of energy it contains lpg uses there are more than  applications of lpg hundreds of millions of people currently use lpg and depend on it for thousands of applications in commercial business industry transportation farming power generation cooking heating and for recreational purposes it is referred to as the world’s most multipurpose energy several billion people around the world use lpg at home for applications such as cooking and heating lpg is the preferred alternative automotive transportation fuel and is increasingly being used as a marine fuel millions of businesses rely on lpg it is the ideal fuel choice for businesses that are not connected to an existing electrical grid farmers across the world rely on lpg to meet the challenge of staying competitive in the modern agricultural environment other industries such as aerosol refrigeration and chemical feedstock all look to lpg to provide sustainable fuel alternatives why use lpg lpg is cleaner than coal and oil and an alternative to gasoline it makes less air pollution fewer soot particulates nitrogen oxides and sulfur and produces fewer emissions of carbon dioxide which cause global warming  lpg is also highly portable making it a convenient source of energy usable in remote places where ordinary gas supplies are unavailable or have been

government has called  the lpg shipping industry international seaborne lpg transportation services are generally provided by two types of operators lpg distributors and traders and independent shipowner fleets like dorian lpg traditionally the main trading route in our industry has been the transport of lpg from the arabian gulf to asia with the emergence of the united states as a major lpg export hub the us gulf to asia has become an important trade route vessels are generally operated under time charters bareboat charters spot charters or contracts of affreightment lpg distributors and traders use their fleets not only to transport their own lpg but also to transport lpg for thirdparty charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators in the tanker charter market lpg transportation services operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand of available vessels generally competition for charters is based upon charter rate customer relationships operating expertise professional reputation and vessel specifications size age and condition very large gas carriers vlgcs like those owned by dorian lpg are the largest class of vessels in the global lpg fleet  these vessels are highly engineered to meet the exacting demands of a customer as well as to comply with strict environmental regulation including emissions regulations  dorian lpgs  modern ecoclass fleet of vlgcs combined with its high level of crew training and strict vessel maintenance program has made it a preferred provider of lpg transportation services key supply fundamentals  us shale revolution has created a fundamental shift in trade flows  rapid growth in both lpg supply and demand creating new dynamic  bifurcation of major supply

prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise
