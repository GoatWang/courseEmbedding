management serving institutional and high networth investors it is led by individuals with many decades of experience in investment research and valueoriented portfolio management disciplines a message from our ceo i formed sanders capital with the aspiration to build a firm known for its investment acumen as important i want sanders capital to be known for the values that i hold dear—values shaped by my forty plus years in the asset management industry as an analyst investor and ceo they are character matters most i believe sustained success in this business is about character asset managers are fiduciaries as such their clients interests must precede all else the truly great enduring firms in this industry are run by people who live this principle every day interests must align financial incentives need to align the interests of asset managers to their clients without asymmetries managers should share in both the upside and the downside for maximum alignment managers must have sufficient skin in the game restrictions on outside investments are also key as they ensure client interests receive undivided attention knowledge conquers emotion bouts of excessive optimism and despair characterize capital markets and are a primary source of wealth destruction knowledge through research converts these extremes from threat to opportunity knowledge provides the basis to do the unpopular and the unpopular is almost always the most profitable temperament trumps brilliance much is written about success in this business too often it is attributed to brilliance—such as seeing and capitalizing on some profound change early intelligence of this kind helps but sustained success has more to do with temperament it is about responding dispassionately and deliberately to change especially unanticipated change which is what occurs most often in this context equanimity and humility trump brilliance and are an antitode to overconfidence and excessive risk taking inaction counts while unusual opportunity is occasional risk is continual if you are not being paid adequately to take on risk which can be for long stretches resist the temptation to do so private focused clientcentric building a firm based on these tenets does not ensure success nothing does but in my experience it improves the odds this is the foundation of sanders capital we will remain a private focused clientcentric firm where knowledge is prized and viewed as our competitive advantage i am energized to lead this firm lewis a sanders chief executive officer investment philosophy at sanders capital we believe that investors systematically overreact to adversity this behavioral bias known as loss aversion unduly depresses asset prices thereby producing investments with aboveaverage returns adversity may be companyspecific or span entire industries or asset classes the objective of sanders capital investment research is to identify assets subject to such pressures especially where the adverse event will prove transitory it is in that subset of investments where we uncover unique opportunity we analyze the full spectrum of opportunities generated by an event across multiple asset classes this methodology greatly improves research insight and enhances our ability to trade off risk and return we are investors not traders the holding period of investments in our portfolios will likely average around three years about the time it takes for most dislocations to find resolution investment services value equities portfolios for clients with fixed asset allocation policies we offer global and us value equity portfolios driven by our overall research and portfolio management disciplines these portfolios benefit from the firm’s all asset research orientation which we believe produces superior forecasts at the asset class level this occurs especially during times of stress when the equity portion of a companys capital structure can be compromised to resolve financing requirements opposite effects are common during robust periods when corporate actions favor equity holders over lenders all asset value portfolios in these services we exploit value opportunities across multiple asset classes in a single portfolio investment objectives of these portfolios are to generate attractive absolute returns while conforming to specified absolute volatility targets targets range from low comparable to bonds of short duration to moderate similar to the bond market overall to high comparable to equities portfolios are managed to achieve absolute returns at or above these volatility targets these portfolios are contained in an all asset value portfolio series offered by private placement memorandum investment process valuation sanders capitals research teams screen the investment universe for securities or assets where the expected internal return meets or exceeds return targets of the services such forecasts are supported by extensive field research and disciplined valuation processes the conversion of all forecasts to the common language of expected return enables comparisons of investments across the capital stack of corporate issuers and all other asset classes our valuation processes include a present value modeling framework for common stocks that compares estimates of future free cash flow to current stock prices to compute expected returns it then compares such returns to a broad universe of companies and establishes both absolute and relative views of return potential a fixed income cash flow modeling framework that compares market prices to predictions of loan performance to compute expected returns such returns take into account the idiosyncratic features of deal structure conversion features prepayment options etc and the cash flow pathways triggered by defaults and other factors economic modeling at the global and national level models predict broad trends in corporate profits as well as supply and demand for real assets near and long term surveillance systems to track predictions versus actual results quantitative tools quantitative factors that correlate with future stock and bond returns facilitate screening for opportunities timing of purchases and sales and sizing of positions they also signal forecasting error useful in research review still such tools are adjunctive to the portfolio management process all investments must qualify on fundamental grounds research review the inputs that drive these investment processes are subject to intensive research review and quality assurance by the funds’ chief investment officers and director of research in collaboration with both internal and external research analysts portfolio construction  risk assessment our portfolio construction process aims to maximize riskadjusted returns by rank ordering investment options among qualifying investments according to expected return we systematically assess these opportunities against estimates of absolute volatility and covariance position weights among qualifying investments are set to maximize expected return for a given level of volatility as measured against the portfolios return benchmark team lewis a sanders ceo  cocio lewis a sanders is the founder ceo and cocio of sanders capital llc mr sanders was the former chairman  and ceo  of alliancebernstein lp he
