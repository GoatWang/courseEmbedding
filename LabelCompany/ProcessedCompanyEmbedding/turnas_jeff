president of  by whole foods a line of smaller cheaper stores by the austinbased company he was the guest tuesday for austin business journals monthly face  face interview series and spoke about the challenges of starting a new brand within an established corporation as well as his background and the team hes assembled whole foods nasdaq wfm announced the  brand in may  and the first location opened in may  near los angeles nos  and  came online not long after near portland and in the seattle suburb of bellevue which was only  miles away from a traditional whole foods store youre not going to go to  for the wow factor that you get at whole foods turnas said youre going to go for the wow factor of price and exciting products the first location in the austin area is scheduled to open in spring  in endeavor real estate groups the parke development in cedar park turnas said tuesday the store will partner with austins easy tiger bake shop  beer garden and juiceland for its friends of  program which brings outside business into  locations to sell their unique wares and services turnas also said the austin area could support several stores but declined to give a specific number of how many  locations central texans can expect he did say the company is already working on a second site in the area when john mackey started the first whole foods store in austin in  he was a pioneer in organic and natural foods and the thorough sourcing of product providers now larger retail chains and upstarts are pressuring whole foods on both sides to cut prices as the entire industry deals with shifting consumer trends the company has faced stiff competition from legacy grocery companies and bigbox stores such as kroger co and walmart stores inc as well as growing players in the sector such as trader joe’s and sprouts turnas said he even keeps an eye on amazoncom which is likely getting into bricks and mortar turnas has been part of the shifting grocery landscape for about  years he has been with whole foods since  after it acquired the chain of small stores where he worked in detroit he has held various leadership positions at whole foods most recently for sixplus years as president of the companys united kingdom operations the goal of  by whole foods market is to keep our quality standards  and deliver them at more competitive prices turnas said he leads a team of about  people in a small office above the recreational equipment inc retail store in downtown austin — across the street from whole foods headquarters by controlling all of the purchasing for the  chain turnas said executives can promise more to vendors on issues such as product placement  by whole foods market also prices foods differently — by item or serving instead of by the pound someone can pick up an apple and see exactly what it costs he said the  brand is also a chance for the company to experiment with new retail technology such as improving the selfcheckout process further advances like checking out by the cartload and using drones to deliver products are farther off turnas said but concepts that intrigue him ultimately  by whole foods market will be a test for austins largest public company which has about  employees worldwide — and whether it can deliver the same experience that made it a household name at lower prices it aims to achieve that by reducing capital and labor costs — the  locations dont employ butchers or fishmongers — and using a loyalty program with customer discounts competition is certainly like weve never seen before turnas said its so easy to get good food now  online meal solutions — its just everywhere you look theres competition this is not the only thing were doing at whole foods its one of the things weve always been ahead he added

do it but it takes time  doesn’t have anything it has to overcome” a whole new vision how jeff turnas and his team are trimming costs and lowering prices in the new  by whole foods market stores store design a standardized layout with shorter shelves and freezer cases makes the stores cheaper to build and easier for customers to navigate and requires fewer employees interiors will be left largely unfinished with exposed ductwork and unpainted ceilings product displays digital price tags can be changed to reflect promotions without moving physical stickers or signs whenever possible produce will be left in its original shipping crates saving stocking time and reducing the chance of employees bruising or dropping items customer service instead of individual service counters one unified team will oversee the entire store which means customers are going to have to be much more selfreliant the  mobile site will also do some heavy lifting much like the whole foods market app it will function as a loyalty card and digital shopping portal for instacart delivery but it will also tell shoppers which products are gmo–free dairyfree kosher or “good for the earth” employee communication rather than using bulletin boards log books and backofhouse posters for communication  employees will access announcements including video demonstrations of new products from a mobile app operations and ordering although each whole foods store selects its own products only  of the inventory for  stores will come from local purveyors a central team in austin will take care of the rest anchored by whole foods’ own  line to pilot this new agile boat mackey looked to turnas who started his career at whole foods as a beer buyer in  and worked in five different territories before becoming president of the uk region in  while there he introduced partnerships that let popular restaurants operate inside his stores and pulled the cheesemonger out from behind the counter to interact more with customers “jeff led the uk entrepreneurially” says whole foods market executive vp of operations david lannon “we felt that he would have that same independent spirit when we launched this brand” last summer turnas moved to austin and was given about a year to create an entirely new retail concepthe began with the stores’ basic design while whole foods markets are built from scratch to reflect the communities in which they’re located turnas and his team created store formats that can be easily replicated across the country “at whole foods cookiecutter is kind of a bad word” turnas says “at  we love it because it allows us to be efficient and meet our goal of getting healthier food to more people” the aim is for each  store to cost about half as much to build as a whole foods market averaging about  square feet each they’ll also be significantly smallergetting the product mix right has been key whereas whole foods prides itself on variety turnas whittled offerings down to what was most essential and affordable which allows for a more streamlined centralordering system nearly  of the nonperishable items will come from whole foods’ own lowercost  label the rest will be rigorously selected a regular whole foods store for instance might carry  or  brands of water in its efforts to keep prices lower  plans to carry just four turnas and his team applied this approach—what they call “thoughtful simplicity”—to everything from store design to product displaysbut even with a focus on value turnas found a way to keep some of whole foods’ flair in his new brand he developed a “friends of ” program that installs thirdparty vendors inside the stores similar to the partnerships he launched in the uk “with our lowerlabor lowercost model we can’t do everything” he says “so why not allow others to do it” the silver lake store features a café by allegro coffee company that sells both coffee and tap beer and by chloe a new york city–based veganburger restaurant“our hope is that as we grow we can put these  stores all over” turnas says “and put them in places where whole foods would never be able to go” the company expects to launch three  stores by the end of the year next up lake oswego oregon and bellevue washington and another  in  but the ambition for the project is much larger “we have to adapt whole foods to the future and we can use  as an inspiration” lannon says in other words you may have turnas to thank if you start finding a little more value at your local whole foods tooadvertisementrelated storiesleadershipthe one question

washington post jeff turnas president of  by whole foods markets said he and his team have “looked and turned over every stone to find efficiencies… we’re not putting as much capital into these stores as we would a traditional whole foods” this means taking steps to lay out the stores to reduce work and stocking times and creating cheaper simply designed displays—all in an effort to keep product pricing down even providing fewer product options is on the agenda for these stores that are expected to be only about squarefeet compared to the  to squarefeet that is typical for a whole foods “rather than  or  olive oils we’re going to have ” turnas said about his strategy to streamline the company’s stock of products “but they’re going to be wellrepresented from around the world and different price points” another big key difference is an emphasis on “prepared foods” and foodservice opportunities the washingon post reports that turnas refers to ’s program as “a little more getityourself selfserve” than what you see in a traditional whole foods  is also introducing a program called “friends of ” in which it will give other retailers or foodservice companies their own independent retail spaces inside of various locations “we’ve really dedicated ourselves to partnering with likeminded companies that are doing new and interesting things in their respective field to bring a truly unique shopping experience that complements our thoughtfully curated selection of foods” turnas added in a press release the first store in silver lake will include a squarefoot vegan fastcasual restaurant called chloe a squarefoot allegro coffee company bar that will serve craft coffee and beer and a selfserve kiosk called teabot that allows shoppers to mix up to three of  different teas and herbal ingredients shoppers will also be able to order online and get delivery services through instacart the company says as whole foods plans to open two additional  locations in
