requires no power cords or batteries only the natural light of your home or office the threefingered acrylic base is included with every mova globethe mova globe rotates peacefully and silently using only the energy of room light and the force of the earths magnetic field this is possible because the mova globe is actually an inner globe that rotates and is contained within an outer shell made of very clear acrylic that does not rotate the thin space between the inner globe and outer shell is filled with a safe perfectly clear fluid that buoyantly supports the inner globe completely out of contact with the outer shell this inner globe floating and turning in a virtually frictionfree environment and energized by light is analogous to the earth itself the mova globe is being brought to market at a time when people everywhere will understand and appreciate this analogythe optical properties of the outer sell and fluid are carefully chosen so that the graphic features on the surface of the inner globe are magnified and appear to be on the outer surface of the outer shell this means that the outer shell actually appears to movethe mova globe can rest on an attractive three fingered stand that is provided or on just about any other kind of stand that can be chosen to complement its graphic design they appear to rotate in spite of resting on the stand in quiet defiance of commonly held ideas about the laws of frictiona carefully designed and highly efficient drive mechanism within the inner globe drives the rotation even in room light energy for the drive is provided by very advanced solar cells within the inner globe illuminated by light passing through the graphic on the globe the drive includes a magnetic element that reacts with the earths magnetic field much as a common compass does to provide torque to drive the globeall of these elements of the mova globe cooperate to create a beautiful magical object that provides a meditative point of focus to any room the perfect gift the mova globe  mova international mova cartselect language search for shop globes mova creations in action shop for mova creations shop now latest news  awesome destinations to

sutra inch revolving globe is great focal spot or subtle reminder on your desk price  sale price        about the mova globes how the mova globe works the worlds most advanced globe the mova globe rotates silently and is inspired by the earth itself it requires no power cords or batteries only the natural light of your home or office the threefingered acrylic base is included with every mova globethe mova globe rotates peacefully and silently using only the energy of room light and the force of the earths magnetic field this is possible because the mova globe is actually an inner globe that rotates and is contained within an outer shell made of very clear acrylic that does not rotate the thin space between the inner globe and outer shell is filled with a safe perfectly clear fluid that buoyantly supports the inner globe completely out of contact with the outer shell this inner globe floating and turning in a virtually frictionfree environment and energized by light is analogous to the earth itself the mova globe is being brought to market at a time when people everywhere will understand and appreciate this analogythe optical properties of the outer sell and fluid are carefully chosen so that the graphic features on the surface of the inner globe are magnified and appear to be on the outer surface of the outer shell this means that the outer shell actually appears to movethe mova globe can rest on an attractive three fingered stand that is provided or on just about any other kind of stand that can be chosen to complement its graphic design they appear to rotate in spite of resting on the stand in quiet defiance of commonly held ideas about the laws of frictiona carefully designed and highly efficient drive mechanism within the inner globe drives the rotation even in room light energy for the drive is provided by very advanced solar cells within the inner globe illuminated by light passing through the graphic on the globe the drive includes a magnetic element that reacts with the earths magnetic field much as a common compass does to provide torque to drive the globeall of these elements of the mova globe cooperate to create a beautiful magical object that provides a meditative point of focus to any room
