chilling technologies stellar energy has designed and supplied tiac systems for electric utilities independent power producers municipal powergeneration facilities industrial power islands and liquefied natural gas facilities across the globe maximizing the turbines potential while gas turbines are very efficient powergeneration systems when the weather gets hot they lose power output unfortunately this happens at the exact time when power is needed most as more people turn on air conditioning causing a surge in electricity demand however by applying turbine inlet air chilling tiac systems power producers can avoid this output drop improving their profitability and guaranteeing constant power production by mechanically chilling the inlet air before it enters the compressor tiac gives the turbine a boost and restores the power produced to the nominalrated output the result is up to  percent more overall power output our tiac systems from power plants to lng plants our range

unusual for a tiac system to cost onethird the capital investment of a new turbine and half that of a new peaking plant calculated in dollars per kilowatt improve heat rate and reduce emissions when installed on a combined cycle plant tiac can reduce emissions by providing peak capacity at combined cycle heat rates and lower emissions than a peaking plant in addition tiac can be fueled by renewable energy or waste heat enhance operational stability and flexibility including opportunity for energy storage tiac systems can incoporate thermal energy storage shifting power required to run the chilling system to offpeak times when power is in less demand this increases the power available for dispatch during peak periods improve financial performance while actual numbers depend on many factors it is not unusual for a tiac system to cost onethird the capital investment of a new turbine and half that of a new peaking plant calculated in dollars per kilowatt improve power plant life

is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising
