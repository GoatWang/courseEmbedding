 estimated long term return   cusip e e estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the unit price estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your trust these estimates are as of the opening of business on the date of deposit and will vary thereafter we base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life this estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses we derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds these estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns no return calculation can predict your actual return your actual return may vary from these estimates prospectus part i november   this prospectus contains two parts no one may use this prospectus part i unless

income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of longterm bonds insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in the trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investors service inc rating of aaa o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk the portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payment in the future o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected o the trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer this makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio the types of bond in the portfolio are listed under portfolio diversification on the next page o the trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of issuers located in california these issuers make up approximately  of the principal amount of the bonds the financial condition of california is affected by various national and local economic social and environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the value of units o we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the

selection the objective of a longterm trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of longterm bonds the objective of an intermediateterm trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediateterm bonds the objective of a laddered trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio consisting of bonds with laddered maturities of approximately     and  years from the date of deposit there is of course no guarantee that a trust will achieve its objective your trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually in selecting bonds for each trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a with respect to insured trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investor service inc moodys rating of aaa and with respect to all other trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of at least bbb a moodys rating of at least baa or if not rated credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in a longterm investment grade trust or an investment grade trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in an insured trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust neither the public offering price nor any evaluation of units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by an insured trust unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default see public offeringunit price in order for bonds to be eligible for insurance they must have credit characteristics which would qualify them for at least the standard  poors rating of bbb or at least the moodys investors service inc rating of baa which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment grade see description of ratings in the information supplement insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancelable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds when due is issued by the insurer a monthly premium is paid by a trust for the insurance obtained by it the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a portfolio insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained from the respective portfolio insurer by an insured trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis all bonds insured by a portfolio insurer or by a preinsured bond insurer receive a aaa rating by standard  poors standard  poors describes securities it rates aaa as having the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement which is available upon request contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in prospectus part i additional discussion of call provisions appears in the information supplement bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds taxable municipal bonds your trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds in your portfolio are listed in prospectus part i these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police

similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers

demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals consumer product and retail issuers your trust may invest significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits competitiveness in the retail industry will require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but will require sophisticated technology to remain competitive financial services companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by financial services companies any negative impact on this industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of this industry before you invest banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the recently enacted grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the volatility of the securities markets in general adverse changes in the direction of the securities markets investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerdealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers already extensively regulated insurance companies profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law changes telecommunications companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies these companies are subject to substantial governmental regulation for example the united states government and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer this industry has experienced substantial deregulation in recent years deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by your trust competitive pressures are intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility certain telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than larger established issuers smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources their securities may trade in lower volumes than larger companies as a result the prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of other issuers more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current returns and the estimated longterm returns as of the date of deposit are set forth on the cover of prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your trust and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the sales charge for an intermediateterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge for a laddered trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds and the sales charge for a longterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life eltr life of your trusts portfolio eltr life sales charge

the time of purchase we also apply the different purchase levels on a dollar basis using a  unit equivalent for example if you purchase between  and  your sales charge discount per unit for a longterm trust will be  aggregated purchasesfor purposes of achieving these levels you may combine purchases of units of a trust offered in this prospectus with purchases of units of any other van kampensponsored unit investment trust in the initial offering period including other trusts offered in this prospectus in addition units purchased in the name of your spouse or children under  living in the same household as you will be deemed to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level the reduced sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing units for a single trust estate including multiple trusts created under a single estate or fiduciary account to be eligible for aggregation as described in this paragraph all purchases must be made on the same day through a single brokerdealer or selling agent you must inform your brokerdealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge letter of intentfor purposes of calculating the reduced sales charge for quantity purchases in the table above purchasers who have entered into a letter of intent with the sponsor prior to february   to purchase a specified amount of units of van kampen unit trusts taxable income series or van kampen unit trusts municipal series unit investment trusts during the initial offering period will be eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the quantity discount table above based on the amount of intended aggregate purchases as expressed in the letter of intent new letters of intent are no longer being offered by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder agrees that the first purchase of units following the execution of such letter of intent will be at least  of the total amount of the intended aggregate purchases expressed in the unitholders letter of intent further through the establishment of the letter of intent the unitholder agrees that units representing  of the total amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the trustee pending completion of these purchases all distributions on units held in escrow will be credited to the unitholders account if total purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a unitholders letter of intent the units held in escrow will be transferred to the unitholders account a unitholder who purchases units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of units specified in a unitholders letter of intent the amount of which would cause the unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge reduction will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the purchase of units which caused the unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of units during the letter of intent period if the total purchases are less than the amount specified the unitholder involved must pay the sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied the unitholder will however be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level if the unitholder does not pay the additional amount within  days after request by the sponsor or the unitholders securities representative the sponsor will instruct the trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed units to meet the required payment by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder irrevocably appoints the sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of the unitholders escrowed units with full power of substitution in the premises a unitholder or his securities representative must notify the sponsor whenever the unitholder makes a purchase of units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended amount fee accounts a portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in this paragraph purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the sponsor please refer to the section called fee accounts for additional information on these purchases units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the public offering price less

establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge wrap fee is imposed fee accounts if the units are purchased for a fee account and the trust is subject to a wrap fee ie the trust is wrap fee eligible the sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of units described in this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a trust exchanges during the initial offering period of a trust unitholders of any van kampensponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit

officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts unit price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading provided however on the date of deposit the evaluation time will be the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately  more than the bid price the public offering price per unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the evaluation time on each business day orders received by the sponsor prior to the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the evaluation time that are properly transmitted to the sponsor by the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of receipt orders received by the sponsor after the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted to the sponsor until after the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of the next determined public offering price per unit provided they are received timely by the sponsor on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received by them to the sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by your trust b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by your trust the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although your trust accrues interest daily because of this your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by underwriters brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the

tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income expenses  general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts the trustee also may withdraw from these accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the trusts amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts all costs and expenses incurred in creating and establishing the trusts including the cost of the initial preparation printing and execution of the trust

actual costs of providing these services for a trust but the total amount received for providing these services to all van kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the total cost of providing the services in any calendar year the evaluator will receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i for evaluating each trusts portfolio for its services the trustee will receive the fee indicated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i which may be reduced as described therein part of the trustees compensation for its services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the principal and interest accounts for future distributions payment of expenses and redemptions since these

such bonds neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds consumer product and retail issuers the trust may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits in addition competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services companies the trust may invest in issuers within the bank and financial services sector in general banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin recently bank profits have come under pressure as net interest margins have contracted but volume gains have been strong in both commercial and consumer products there is no certainty that such conditions will continue banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets which have been weak in the past can have a substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the recently enacted grammleachbliley financialservices overhaul legislation will allow banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law under the legislation banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state one year after the legislations enactment since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the bonds in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture telecommunications issuers because your trust may be concentrated in bonds issued by telecommunications companies the value of the units may be susceptible to factors affecting the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation and the products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence these factors could affect the value of units telephone companies in the united states for example are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise while a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers of traditional telecommunication products and services a trust may also invest in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development of new products and services these smaller companies may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation and may also involve greater risk than large established issuers such smaller companies may have limited product lines market or financial resources and their securities may trade less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger more established companies as a result the prices of the securities of such smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other issuers in addition recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by a trust taxable municipal issues certain bonds in a trust may consist of taxable obligations of municipal issuers obligations of municipal issuers can be either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest insurance on the bonds in an insured trust insurance has been obtained by each insured trust by the issuer of bonds in each insured trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior the deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such insured trust see the trustsobjective and bond selection in the prospectus each insurance policy obtained by an insured trust is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as such insured trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such insured trust see portfolio for the trust in the prospectus part i nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by an insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such insured trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an insured trust are fixed for the life of an insured trust the premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer and any such policy or policies are noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the portfolio insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due for the purposes of the portfolio insurance when due generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the portfolio insurer involved has the option in its sole discretion for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from an insured trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by an insured trust is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such insured trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise an insured trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basisthe insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to an insured trust in that each bond insured by an insured trust insurance policy may be sold out of the insured trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to such insured trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event an insured trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that the insured trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if the insured trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in the prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of an insured trust if the insured trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default the insured trust would not need to hold such bonds until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the insured trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in the prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bond not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii for a more complete description of an insured trusts method of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default ambac assurance corporation ambac assurance effective july   ambac indemnity corporation changed its name to ambac assurance corporation the insurance policy of ambac assurance obtained by an insured trust is noncancelable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in the insurance policy are held by an insured trust a monthly premium is paid by an insured trust for the insurance policy obtained by it the trustee will pay when due successively the full amount of each installment of the insurance premium pursuant to a binding agreement with ambac assurance in the event of a sale of a bond covered by the ambac assurance insurance policy the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance

the value of the securities by appraisal or  by any combination of the above security cost  the original cost to the trust insured income trust series  was based on the determination by the evaluator of the offering prices of the securities on the date of deposit november   since the valuation is based upon the bid prices the trust insured income trust series  recognized a downward adjustment of  on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices this downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the trust for the period ended october   unit valuation  the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in the trust based upon  the cash on hand in the

federal income taxes  for a trust with a date of deposit prior to august   such trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes thus such a trust will not be treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes and each unitholder will be considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such trust accordingly no provision has been made for federal income taxes for a trust with a date of deposit on or after august   each such trust has elected and intends to qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment as a

callable at declining prices thereafter but not below par value except for original issue discount securities which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus if applicable some premium the amount of which will decline in subsequent years in addition even if no year is shown in the table the security may have a make whole call option and be redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of the securities a make whole amount and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption the make whole amount will generally be equal to the excess if any of i the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption that would have been payable if redemption had not been made determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate which varies from security to security and is generally equal to an average of yields on us treasury obligations with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the security plus a premium rate from the dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable if the redemption had not been made over ii the aggregate principal amount of the securities being redeemed in addition the securities may also be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur sf indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of securities pr indicates a security has been prerefunded note   portfolio continued redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par to the extent that the securities were deposited in the trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units conversely to the extent that the securities were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed securities and there will be distributed to unitholders the principal amount in excess of  per unit semiannually for trusts with a date of deposit prior to april   or in excess of  per unit monthly for trusts with a date of deposit on or after april   and any premium received on such redemption however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account exceed  per unit for trusts with a date of deposit prior to april   the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next succeeding monthly distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record date the estimated current return in this event may be affected by such redemptions for the federal tax effect on unitholders of such redemptions and resultant distributions see federal tax status in part ii of this prospectus insurance  insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on certain of the securities in the trust may have been obtained by the trust or by one of the preinsured security insurers as indicated in the security name however certain other securities may not be insured such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the securities or the value of the units for securities covered under the trusts insurance policy the insurance is effective only while securities thus insured are held in the trust and the insurance premium which is a trust obligation is paid on a monthly basis the premium for insurance which has been obtained from various insurance companies by the issuer of the security involved is payable by the issuer asc states that for financial reporting purposes insurance coverage of the type acquired by the trust does not have any measurable fair value in the absence of default of the underlying bonds or of indications of the probability of such default fair value measurements  as described in note  the trust utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of its investments asc establishes both a framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation methods the various inputs that may be used to determine the value of the trusts investments are summarized in the three levels presented below the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities level   quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level   prices determined using other significant observable inputs observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security which may include quoted prices for similar securities interest rates prepayment speeds and credit risk level   prices determined using significant unobservable inputs in certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable unobservable inputs may be used unobservable inputs reflect the trusts own assumptions

aggregate bid price of the securities in the portfolio of the trust plus interest accrued to the date of settlement if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other business reasons the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices in the event that a market is not maintained for the units a unitholder desiring to dispose of his units may be able to do so only by tendering such units to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price note   other continued cost to investors  the cost to original investors was based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate offering price of the securities per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge of  of the public offering price which is equivalent to  of the aggregate offering price of the securities for the trust the secondary market cost to investors is based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate bid price of the securities per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge based upon the estimated longterm return life of the securities in the trust the sales charge ranges from  of the public offering price  of the aggregate bid price of the securities for a trust with an estimated longterm return life with less than two years to  of the public offering price  of the aggregate bid price of the securities for a trust with a portfolio with an estimated longterm return

public offeringoffering price in order for bonds to be eligible for insurance they must have credit characteristics which would qualify them for at least the sp rating of bbb or at least the moodys rating of baa which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment grade see description of ratings in the information supplement insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancelable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds when due is issued by the insurer a monthly premium is paid by a trust for the insurance obtained by it the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a portfolio insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained from the respective portfolio insurer by a trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis all bonds insured by a portfolio insurer or by a preinsured bond insurer receive a aaa rating by sp sp describes securities it rates aaa as having the highest rating assigned by sp to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years on august   standard  poors rating services downgraded the longterm sovereign credit rating of the united states of america to aa from aaa citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your trusts holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls or the credit rating on a bond included in a blackrock trust or a variable rate trust is downgraded as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes interest rates in the united states are at or near historic lows which may increase your trusts exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates with respect only to a variable rate trust because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates falling shortterm interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to a variable rate trust on its floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income however investments in floating rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in a variable rate trusts net asset values during periods of changing interest rates compared to changes in values of fixedrate debt securities nevertheless changes in interest rates can affect the value of a variable rate trusts floating rate investments especially if rates change sharply in a short period because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates credit risk is the risk that a securitys issuer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security while interest and principal payments on ginnie mae securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government a gnma income portfolio and the units thereof are not guaranteed or insured by the us government or any government agency in addition neither the us government nor ginnie mae guarantees the market value or yield on ginnie mae securities prepayment risk is the chance that borrowers prepay their mortgage loans earlier than expected and in particular may affect the units of a gnma income portfolio this reduces the trusts life and future interest income any payment of mortgage debt before it is due is called prepayment most mortgage loans may be prepaid at any time by the borrower without penalty each mortgagebacked security payment includes a return of principal as well as interest prepayments of the entire mortgage occur when borrowers refinance or sell their homes they may refinance to consolidate debts or take advantage of lower interest rate mortgages as interest rates decrease the rate of refinancings may increase significantly thereby increasing the prepayment risk of mortgagebacked securities extra monthly principal payments made near the trusts inception may significantly reduce the interest amount paid by the borrower to the lender and therefore the future amount received by the trust your trust will distribute prepayments of principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall as a result of the prepaid principal you also might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough principal is prepaid on the securities in your trust your trust could terminate significantly earlier than expected call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in particular are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions see taxable municipal bondsbuild america bonds and taxable municipal bondsqualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds below the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section and the notes thereof in prospectus part i bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections a gnma income portfolio concentrates in mortgagebacked securities you should understand these securities before you invest these securities are described in detail in the section titled ginnie mae securities extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the trusts life due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgagebacked securities as a result the securities in your trust and in particular any mortgagebacked securities in a gnma income portfolio may become more sensitive to rising interest rates and may decrease in value foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of united states issuers these risks can increase the potential for losses in the trust and affect its unit price these risks may include risks such as losses due to political economic and social developments international trade conditions foreign taxes including withholding taxes restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the trust to exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of the trusts investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the trusts portfolio securities foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent thereby adversely affecting the trusts net asset value no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange because of the difficulties currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services industry many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity as a result of such illiquidity the trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests certain trusts may hold bonds that are rule a restricted securities pursuant to the securities act of  as amended  act and may be subject to enhanced liquidity risk rule a securities are restricted securities that may only be resold in accordance with the applicable provisions of the  act rule a establishes a safe harbor from the registration requirements of the  act for resale of certain securities to qualified institutional buyers restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated transactions or in a public offering with respect to a registration statement which is in effect under the  act a restricted security in a trust may not be readily marketable at the time such a trust may be seeking to sell such securities such as for a request for redemption an insufficient number of qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing restricted securities held by a trust may adversely affect the marketability of such securities and the trustee might be unable to dispose of such trust securities promptly or at reasonable prices where registration is required for the resale of a restricted security a trust may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse from the time the trustee attempts to sell such restricted trust securities and the time the trustee may be permitted to sell the restricted trust securities under an effective registration statement due to the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation associated with restricted securities the trustee may experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within three business days insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds taxable municipal bonds your trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds in your trust are listed in prospectus part i these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary build america bonds

be used for capital expenditures and c where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to have this subsection of the code apply should a build america bonds issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on the bonds by the code it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments in addition build america bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to sections aa or  of the code as added by the recovery act or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a build america bond issuers borrowing costs qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds collectively qualified bonds are taxable bonds that are similar to certain build america bonds in that state and municipal qualified bond issuers

recent years to provide for certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of qualified bonds and to include such bonds under the definition of qualified tax credit bond as found in section a of the code eligible issuers of qualified school construction bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury eligible issuers of qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury should the issuer of a qualified bond fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the code or other federal laws it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds as provided in section a of the code qualified bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance this mandatory redemption must be completed within  days after such threeyear period unless an extension is granted by the treasury additionally qualified bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any qualified bond issuers borrowing costs certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation cost of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals

acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make

family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating

and rate approvals ginnie mae securities gnma income portfolios invest exclusively in ginnie mae securities these securities are backed by mortgage loans these securities represent an ownership interest in mortgage loans made by banks and other financial institutions to finance purchases of homes individual loans are pooled together by ginnie maeapproved issuers for sale to investors commonly referred to as passthrough certificates these securities entitle an investor to an undivided interest in the underlying mortgage loan pool the investor receives a proportionate share of the interest reduced by servicing and guaranty fees and principal on the underlying mortgage loans payments on ginnie mae securities to investors occur monthly these payments are called modified passthrough payments because through ginnie maes mortgagebacked securities program money is passed from the borrower through to the investors in the ginnie mae securities it is modified because if the amount collected from the borrowers is less than the amount due the issuer modifies the passthrough to add on an amount from its corporate funds to make the payment complete each group of ginnie mae securities shown in the portfolio section of prospectus part i under a specified range of maturities includes individual mortgagebacked securities which may have varying maturities within each range if there is no difference in price among the individual ginnie mae securities within each group on the basis of the difference in the maturity dates of each security a purchase of ginnie mae securities with the same coupon rate and a maturity date within the related range will be considered an acquisition of the same security in the future however the difference in maturity ranges could affect the market value of the individual ginnie mae securities if this happens any additional purchases by your trust will take into account the maturities of the individual securities the government national mortgage association known as ginnie mae was created in  as a wholly owned corporation within the department of housing and urban development through its mortgagebacked securities program ginnie mae seeks to increase the liquidity and efficiency of mortgage loan funding making more capital available to low and moderateincome homeowners at competitive interest rates the primary function

principal and interest due on the pooled mortgages that back their securities the payments also include any prepayments and early recoveries of principal on the pooled mortgages these payments are guaranteed even if borrowers or issuers default on their obligation if the issuer fails to make the payment ginnie mae will make the payment to the investor neither ginnie mae nor the us government guarantees or insures  the market value or yields of ginnie mae securities  the trust or  the units of the trust in any way state risk factors your trust may invest significantly in taxable municipal bonds of issuers from a particular state the financial condition of a state may be affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally limitations imposed by constitutional amendments legislative measures or voter initiatives on a state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of a state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors such as natural disasters complications with exports and industry deregulation a state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations corporate bond industry risks your trust may invest significantly in certain industries any negative impact on the related industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of these industries before you invest consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits competitiveness in the retail industry will require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but will require sophisticated technology to remain competitive changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and the success of consumer products and services in the marketplace financial services issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by financial services companies companies in the financial services industry include but are not limited to companies involved in activities such as banking mortgage finance consumer finance specialized finance industrial finance and leasing investment banking and brokerage asset management and custody corporate lending insurance and financial investment and real estate including real estate investment trusts in general financial services issuers are substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions including the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets interest rates as well as currency and commodities prices investor sentiment the rate of corporate and consumer defaults inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate competition from new entrants in their fields of business extensive government regulation and the overall health of the us and international economies the financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global developments over the last several years stemming from the financial crisis including recessionary conditions deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt a substantial amount of assets have been written down by financial institutions with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers into liquidation combination or other restructuring this also has significantly increased the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these problems many of the institutions may continue to experience difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital in addition the liquidity of certain debt instruments has been reduced or eliminated due to the lack of available market makers while the us and foreign governments and their respective government agencies have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps most financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business challenging economic and political conditions along with increased public scrutiny during the past several years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the us and abroad creating additional difficulties for financial institutions regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services issuers are currently subject thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal costs as well as the potential for higher operational capital and liquidity costs proposed or enacted regulations may further limit the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments certain financial services issuers can make and further may limit the interest rates and fees they can charge the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain these laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial institution does business and the products and services it may provide increased regulation may restrict a companys ability to compete in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses new regulations may reduce or limit a companys revenue or impose additional fees limit the scope of their activities increase assessments or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative consequences among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act enacted into federal law on july   the doddfrank act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address emerging risks and issues in the nations evolving financial system it also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes including in areas such as systemic risk regulation overthecounter derivatives market oversight and federal consumer protection the doddfrank act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come including banks thrifts depository institution holding companies mortgage lenders insurance companies industrial loan companies brokerdealers and other securities and investment advisory firms private equity and hedge funds consumers numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure in particular certain provisions of the doddfrank act increase the capital requirements of certain financial services companies supervised by the federal reserve resulting in such companies incurring generally higher deposit premiums these types of regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your trust and could lead to decreases in such issuers profits or revenues in many cases the full impact of the doddfrank act on a financial institutions business remains uncertain because of the extensive rulemaking still to be completed the sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation on the securities in your trust or on the financial services industry in general financial services companies in foreign countries are also subject to regulatory and interest rate concerns in particular government regulation in certain foreign countries may include controls on interest rates credit availability prices and currency transfers negative developments regarding eurozone sovereign debt including the potential for further downgrades of sovereign credit ratings as well as downgrades to the ratings of the us governments sovereign credit rating could adversely affect financial services issuers in addition the departure of any eurozone country from use of the euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign exchanges operations and settlements which may have an adverse effect on financial services issuers the financial condition of customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect financial services issuers financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of market making trading clearing or other counterparty relationships many of these transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result of the actions of or deterioration in the commercial soundness of other counterparty financial institutions economic and market conditions may increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer client or counterparty default downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity cash flows competitive position financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting access to funding or capital markets increasing borrowing costs or triggering increased collateral requirements financial services issuers face significant legal risk both from regulatory investigations and proceedings as well as private actions profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and may fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition further economic conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on certain banks and savings associations declining real estate values could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the volatility of the equity market in general adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally terrorism weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers life and health insurance companies may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates including the effect of epidemics insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability health care issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by health care companies these issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotechnology managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies these companies face substantial government regulation and approval procedures general risks of health care companies include extensive competition product liability litigation and evolving government regulation on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of  incorporating the patient protection and affordable care act collectively the act was enacted into law the act continues to have a significant impact on the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a complex and ongoing process with varying effective dates significant provisions of the act include the introduction of required health care coverage for most americans significant expansion in the number of americans eligible for medicaid modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families the act also provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions although the entirety of the act will not come into effect until  in the interim health care companies will face continuing and significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs and changes in the health care market the sponsor is unable to predict the full impact of the act on the securities in your trust as illustrated by the act congress may from time to time propose legislative action that will impact the health care sector the proposals may span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which may include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs incentives for competition in the provision of health care services promotion of prepaid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector the government could also reduce funding for health care related research drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales product obsolescence increased government regulation termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come to market the research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial this process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval these companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years if at all the failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its stock the goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of malpractice claims product liability claims or other litigation health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services the ability of the facility to provide required services an increased emphasis on outpatient services confidence in the facility management capabilities competitive forces that may result in price discounting efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and termination or restriction of government financial assistance such as medicare medicaid or similar programs industrials issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition consolidation domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending and leverage levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials labor relations government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment aircraft order cancellations disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts labor disputes changes in government budget priorities changes in aircraftleasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel the number of housing starts levels of public and nonresidential construction including weakening demand for new office and retail space and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment manufacturers technology issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies in the technology sector which includes information technology companies these companies include those involved in computer and business services enterprise softwaretechnical software internet and computer software internetrelated services networking and telecommunications equipment telecommunications services electronics products server hardware computer hardware and peripherals semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors these companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions companies in this sector face risks from rapid changes in technology competition dependence on certain suppliers and supplies rapid obsolescence of products or services patent termination frequent new products and government regulation these companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or reduction in supply of components or loss of key customers and failure to comply with certain industry standards an unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a company the failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the companys results technology companies may also be smaller andor less experienced companies with limited product lines markets or resources stocks of some internet companies have high pricetoearnings ratios with little or no earnings histories technology stocks tend to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading announcements about new products technologies operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically at times however extreme price and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company this can impact your ability to redeem your units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid telecommunications issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies these companies are subject to substantial governmental regulation for example the united states government and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer this industry has experienced substantial deregulation in recent years deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by your trust competitive pressures are intense and values of telecommunications company securities can experience rapid volatility certain telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances several highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than larger established issuers smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources their securities may trade in lower volumes than larger companies as a result the prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of securities of other issuers utility and energy issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by utility and energy companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries many utility and energy companies especially electric and gas and other energy related utility companies are subject to various uncertainties including o risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs o restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result of environmental nuclear safety and other regulations o regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer o coping with the general effects of energy conservation o technological innovations which may render existing plants equipment or products obsolete o the effects of local weather maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors o the potential impact of natural or manmade disasters o difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital even if frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions o the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation o difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities and o increased competition any of these factors or a combination of these factors could affect the supply of or demand for electricity natural gas water or other energy which could adversely affect the profitability of utility and energy company bond issuers and the performance of the your trust utility and energy companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels in the united states at the federal level the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc the federal trade commission the ftc the securities and exchange commission the sec and the nuclear regulatory commission the nrc have authority to oversee electric and combination electric and gas utilities the value of utility and energy company stocks may decline because governmental regulation controlling these industries can change this regulation may prevent or delay the company from passing along cost increases to its customers which could hinder the companys ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by its creditors against such company furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years these utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business these opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of return some companies however may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable mergers in the these industries may require approval from several federal and state regulatory agencies including ferc the ftc and the sec these regulatory authorities could as a matter of policy reverse the trend toward deregulation and make consolidation more difficult or cause delay in the merger process any of which could cause the prices of these stocks to fall more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also included in the portfolio in prospectus part i and notes thereto this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics floating rate bonds a variable rate trust invests in corporate bonds that have variable or floating interest rates a floating rate bond is one whose terms provide for the readjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified interest rate changes and which at any time can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its par value the interest rate on a floating rate bond may be adjusted automatically according to a stated prevailing market rate such as a banks prime rate the day us treasury bill rate london interbank offered rate libor or some other standard the instruments rate is adjusted automatically each time the base rate is adjusted for floating rate bonds the coupon rate is usually reset each time interest is paid a reset date is any date on which the reset takes place based on the value of the index on that date the coupon rate is calculated as the reference rate plus a fixed spread which depends upon the issuers credit quality and specifics of how the instrument is structured floating rate bonds are frequently not rated by credit rating agencies and must satisfy the same quality standards as commercial paper investments floating rate bonds may be secured by bank letters of credit generally the changes in the interest rate on floating rate obligations reduce the fluctuation in their market value as interest rates decrease or increase the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation is less than that for fixedrate obligations of the same maturity some floating rate obligations have a demand feature that allows a variable rate trust to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party prior to its maturity the tender may be at par value plus accrued interest according to the terms of the obligations floating rate demand bonds that have a stated maturity in excess of one year may have features that permit the holder to recover the principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals not exceeding one year and upon no more than  days notice the issuer of that type of bond normally has a corresponding right in its discretion after a given period to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the bond plus accrued interest generally the issuer must provide a specified number of days notice to the holder original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns except for a variable rate trust the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return are set forth in the prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your trust and with the principal prepayment default if any redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a trust will change and there may be corporate developments with respect to bonds held by a blackrock trust there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to calculate estimated returns of a gnma income portfolio and the estimated average life of the securities an estimated prepayment rate for the remaining term of the trusts mortgage pool must be determined each of the primary market makers in ginnie mae securities uses sophisticated computer models to determine the estimated prepayment rate these computer models take into account a number of factors and assumptions including actual prepayment data reported by ginnie mae for recent periods on a particular pool the impact of aging on the prepayment of mortgage pools the current interest rate environment the coupon the housing environment historical trends on ginnie mae securities as a group geographical factors and general economic trends in determining the estimated average life of the securities in your trust the sponsor has relied upon the median of the estimated prepayment rates determined by primary market makers no one can be certain that this estimate will prove accurate or whether the estimated prepayment rates determined by other primary market makers would have provided a better estimate any difference between the estimate used and the actual prepayment rate will affect the estimated longterm return of your trust public offering general units are offered at the public offering price the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account plus accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life in years eltr life of your trusts portfolio eltr life years sales charge  less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     and over   the eltr life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a trusts portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating estimated longterm return see estimated current and longterm returns the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market public offering price per unit for example the maximum secondary market sales charge for a trust with an eltr life of  but less than  years would be  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds reducing your sales charge employees officers and directors including their spouses or the equivalent if recognized under local law and children or stepchildren under  living in the same household parents or stepparents and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons of invesco capital markets inc and its affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase units at the public offering price less the applicable dealer concession all employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm only employees officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts offering price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the bond market association recommends an early bond market close orders received by the trustee or sponsor for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to range approximately from  to  more than the bid price the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of the appropriate bid prices or offering prices as described herein a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by your trust b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by your trust the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by an insured trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid by the bonds semiannually although your trust accrues interest daily because of this your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to purchases of units in the secondary market the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units of series other than those described in the following two sections you will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your units on the next distribution date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your trust and distributed to unitholders if a you sell or redeem all or a portion of your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to qualify units for sale in a number of states brokerdealers or others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of units equal to  of the sales charge applicable to the transaction provided that the units are acquired from the sponsor certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers equal to the agency commission referred to above is retained by or remitted to the banks any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge sponsor compensation brokerdealers will receive a gross sales commission equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved see public offeringgeneral the sponsor will receive from the brokerdealers the excess of this gross sales commission over the amounts set forth in the previous section in addition the sponsor may have realized a profit or loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a trust the sponsor or its affiliates may also have realized profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members the sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in a trust were acquired the sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of units excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed if any will be retained by the sponsor the sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which units are purchased and the price at which units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased units at a price above or below the purchase price we may provide at our own expense and out of our own profits additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell units of a trust and our other products this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisors for past sales we may make these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of a trust and our other products fees may include payment for travel expenses including lodging incurred in connection with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars of a business nature these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units market for units although not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for units and offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash on hand less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of your trust and less any accrued trust expenses if the supply of units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it the sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of units or discontinue purchases of units at these prices if a market is not maintained and the unitholder cannot find another purchaser a unitholder will be able to dispose of units by tendering them to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price see rights of unitholdersredemption of units a unitholder who wishes to dispose of his units should inquire of his broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price per unit it may purchase the units not later than the day on which the units would otherwise have been redeemed by the trustee rights of unitholders distributions of interest and principal unitholders who purchase units in the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the election if any of the prior owner interest received by a trust pro rated on an annual basis will be distributed monthly unless the prior owner of your units elected to receive quarterly or semiannual distributions certain trusts offer only monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and semiannual distribution options a trust that has elected to be structured as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes may make additional distributions at the end of each year interest received by a trust including that part of the proceeds of any disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest is credited by the trustee to the interest account other receipts are credited to the principal account after deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the trustee without interest for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date interest received will be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date all distributions will be net of estimated expenses the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the principal or interest account but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these funds for a trust with a date of deposit prior to april   funds in the principal account will be distributed on each semiannual distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding semiannual record date the trustee is not required to make a distribution from the principal account unless the amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least  per unit however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account equal or exceed  per unit the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the related monthly record date for a trust with a date of deposit on or after april   should the amount available for distribution in the principal account equal or exceed  per unit the trustee will make a distribution from the principal account on the next monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the related monthly record date however funds in the principal account will be distributed on the last distribution date of each calendar year to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date if the amount available for distribution shall equal at least  per unit because interest payments are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year and with respect only to a variable rate trust because the floating rate bonds in a variable rate trust will have varying interest payment amounts over the life of a variable rate trust interest distributions may be more or less than the amount credited to the interest account as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions the trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the interest account on the next record date persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date after the purchase under the applicable plan of distribution redemption of units all or a portion of your units may be tendered to the bank of new york mellon the trustee for redemption at unit investment trust division  sanders creek parkway east syracuse new york  on any day the new york stock exchange is

all or a portion of your units by sending a request for redemption to your bank or brokerdealer through which you hold your units no later than three business days following satisfactory tender the unitholder will receive an amount for each unit equal to the redemption price per unit next computed after receipt by the trustee of the tender of units the date of tender is deemed to be the date on which units are received by the trustee except that as regards units received after the evaluation time on days of trading on the new york stock exchange the date of tender is the next day on which that exchange is open and the units will be deemed to have been tendered to the trustee on that day for redemption at the redemption price redemption requests received by the trustee after the evaluation time and redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the trustee are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the trustee on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in a timely manner certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests units redeemed directly through the trustee are not subject to such fees under irs regulations the trustee is required to withhold a specified percentage of a unit redemption if the trustee has not received the unitholders tax identification number as required by such regulations any amount withheld is transmitted to the irs and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however at any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption the unitholder should provide a tax identification number to the trustee in order to avoid this possible backup withholding the redemption price per unit as well as the secondary market public offering price will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as of the evaluation time on days of trading on the new york stock exchange on the date any such determination is made the evaluator determines the redemption price per unit on days units are tendered for redemption the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit on the basis of i the cash on hand in a trust or moneys in the process of being collected ii the value of the bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds except for cases in which the value of insurance has been included iii accrued interest less a amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges and b the accrued trust expenses the evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of the methods set forth in public offeringoffering price in determining the redemption price per unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance maintained on the bonds in a

by a trust see public offeringoffering price accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the interest account or if the balance therein is insufficient from the principal account all other amounts will be withdrawn from the principal account units so redeemed shall be cancelled the price at which units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by the unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by the units redeemed the trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions when bonds are sold the size and diversity of your trust will be reduced sales may be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period during which the new york stock exchange is closed other than for customary weekend and holiday closings or during which the sec determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable or for other periods as the sec may by order permit under certain extreme circumstances the sponsor may apply to the sec for an order permitting a full or partial suspension of the right of unitholders to redeem their units in addition with respect to van kampen unit trusts taxable income

of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the underwriters including the sponsor so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust the trustee will notify each unitholder of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining bonds the sale of

structured to be taxed as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes please see notes to financial statements in prospectus part i tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt entity or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust the trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and reporting obligations as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust each trust is expected to hold various debt obligations the debt obligations that are treated as debt for federal income tax purposes it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg interest accruals of original issue discount and market discount and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of accruals of original issue discount market discount premium and accrued interest as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain currently is generally  dividends and net capital gains also are subject to a  medicare contribution tax on net investment income for taxpayers at higher income levels net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income dividends received deduction because the debt obligations are treated as debt not equity for federal income tax purposes distributions from the debt obligations are not eligible for the dividends received deduction discount accrued interest and premium on debt obligations some debt obligations may have been issued with original issue discount this generally means that the debt obligations were originally issued at a price below their face or par value original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes your basis of each debt obligation that was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue discount accrues some of the debt obligations may give their issuers a right to defer payments on the debt obligations such debt obligations are subject to special treatment under the original issue discount rules among other things this treatment may result in you being required to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in a particular year with respect to a debt obligation even though the actual cash payments on the debt obligation have been deferred to a later year some debt obligations may have been purchased by you or your trust at a market discount market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity for the debt obligation over the purchase price of the debt obligation market discount can arise based on the price your trust pays for a debt obligation or based on the price you pay for your units market discount is taxed as ordinary income you will recognize this income when your trust receives principal payments on the debt obligation when the debt obligation is disposed of or redeemed or when you sell or redeem your units alternatively you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions some debt obligations may have been purchased by you or your trust at a premium generally if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any debt obligation generally including sales charges exceeds the amount payable at maturity such excess is considered premium you may elect to amortize premium if you make this election you may reduce your interest income received on the debt obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your tax basis will be reduced if the price of your units includes accrued interest on a debt obligation you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that debt obligation when your trust receives this accrued interest you must treat it as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the debt obligation this discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax treatment of original issue discount market discount and premium the rules however are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances for example the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the discussion set forth above in the case of debt obligations that were issued with original issue discount exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future invescosponsored unit investment trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and in general any loss will be treated as capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trust for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the code in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an in kind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units for an in kind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole trust assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same trust assets held by your trust however if you also receive cash in exchange for a trust asset or a fractional portion of a trust asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such trust asset or fractional portion limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes on some of the income from your trust or gain from the sale or redemption of your units provided that certain conditions are met you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for us tax purposes you should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other us tax withholding and reporting requirements foreign taxes some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes any income withheld will still be treated as income to you under the grantor trust rules you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign taxes that are paid therefore for us tax purposes you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes the foreign account tax compliance act fatca a  withholding tax on your trusts distributions including capital gains distributions and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of units generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless i if the foreign entity is a foreign financial institution as defined under fatca the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence reporting withholding and certification obligations ii if the foreign entity is not a foreign financial institution it identifies certain of its us investors or iii the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under fatca pursuant to the rules above and the applicability of any intergovernmental agreements between the united states and the relevant foreign country withholding under fatca is required i with respect to distributions from your trust and ii with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of units that occur on or after january   if withholding is required under fatca on a payment related to your units investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the irs to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction your trust will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under fatca you should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of fatca based on your individual circumstances new york tax status under the existing income tax laws of the state and city of new york your trust will not be taxed as a corporation subject to the new york state franchise tax and the new york city general corporation tax and the income of your trust will pass through to the unitholders in the same manner as for federal income tax purposes you should consult your tax advisor regarding potential federal foreign state or local taxation with respect to your units based on your individual circumstances investors in the trust may be subject to federal state local or foreign taxes in connection with their investment in the trust investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal state local and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment in the trust regulated investment companies this section summarizes some of the principal us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a trust that has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes please see notes to financial statements in prospectus part i this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt entity or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust the trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and reporting obligations as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status certain trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as regulated investment companies under the federal tax laws if a trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as provided in the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that specifies your amount of exemptinterest dividends ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends exemptinterest dividends generally are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes some or all of the exemptinterest dividends however may be taken into account in determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences eg they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are taxed ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your tax rate for ordinary income generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year a distribution paid by your trust reduces the trusts net asset value per unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution accordingly a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of units by a unitholder would be subject to income tax even though it may be viewed in substance as a partial return on capital dividends received deduction and qualified dividend income a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock an individual who owns units generally will not be entitled to treat trust distributions as qualified dividend income currently taxed at longterm capital gains rates as it is not expected that trust distributions will be attributable to qualified dividend income received by the trust sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your initial tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units further if you hold your units for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such a unit will be disallowed to the extent of the exemptinterest dividends you received if any capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain under current law is generally  state and local taxes may also apply net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be disallowed to the extent of the exemptinterest dividends you received to the extent if any it is not disallowed it will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income there is no requirement that tax consequences be taken into account in administering your trust exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future invescosponsored unit investment trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes in general any gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and any loss will be treated as capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an in kind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax rules foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries however it is not expected that any such trust investing in foreign securities will be eligible to pass through to investors any credits or deductions against us federal income tax with respect to such foreign taxes paid foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust reports as capital gain dividends and will generally be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met the amount of distributions that may be reported as interestrelated dividends will be limited to the amount of qualified net interest income which is generally the trusts ussource interest income less allocable expenses backup withholding by law your trust must withhold as backup withholding a percentage of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding or if the irs instructs your trust to do so deductibility of trust expenses generally expenses incurred by your trust will be deducted from the gross income received by your trust and only your share of the trusts net taxable income if any will be paid to you and reported as taxable income to you however if the units of your trust are held by fewer than  unitholders at any time during a taxable year your trust will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income thus resulting in your reported share of your trusts taxable income being increased by your share of those expenses even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution in this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income such deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels investors in the trust may be subject to federal state local or foreign taxes in connection with their investment in the trust investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal state local and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment in the trust the foreign account tax compliance act fatca a  withholding tax on your trusts distributions including capital gains distributions and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of units generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless i if the foreign entity is a foreign financial institution as defined under fatca the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence reporting withholding and certification obligations ii if the foreign entity is not a foreign financial institution it identifies certain of its us investors or iii the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under fatca withholding under fatca is required i with respect to certain distributions from your trust beginning on july   and ii with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of units that occur on or after january   if withholding is required under fatca on a payment related to your units investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the irs to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction your trust will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under fatca you should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of fatca based on your individual circumstances expenses general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts the trustee also may withdraw from these accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a

issuers certain trusts may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits in addition competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and the success of consumer products and services in the marketplace increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in  continue to manifest in nearly all the subdivisions of the financial services industry subprime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in  the impact of these losses among traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or combination while drastically increasing the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital in some cases the us government has acted to bail out or provide support to select institutions however the risk of default by such issuers has nonetheless increased substantially while the us department of the treasury federal reserve board and congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result of these steps banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the grammleachbliley act financialservices overhaul legislation allows banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent years allowing banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission the sec and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the bonds in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the prices of the securities of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture health care issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies within the health care sector health care companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotech managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the health care field these companies are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic the goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of product liability litigation health care facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs legislative proposals concerning health care are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of health care services tax incentives and penalties related to health care insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid health care plans the government could also reduce funding for health care related research the sponsor is unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals if enacted on the issuers of securities in your trust industrials issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition consolidation domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends in addition capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials labor relations government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment aircraft order cancellations disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts labor disputes or changes in government budget priorities changes in aircraftleasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel the number of housing starts levels of public and nonresidential construction including weakening demand for new office and retail space and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers technology issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by issuers within the technology industry which includes information technology companies your trust and therefore unitholders may be particularly susceptible to a negative impact resulting from adverse market conditions or other factors affecting technology issuers because any negative impact on the technology industry will not be diversified among issuers within other unrelated industries accordingly an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of the information technology industry and the risks which such an investment may entail technology companies generally include companies involved in the development design manufacture and sale of computers computer related equipment computer networks communications systems telecommunications products electronic products and other related products systems and services the market for technology products and services especially those specifically related to the internet is characterized by rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions the success of the issuers of the securities depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products an unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuers products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuers operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities will be able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace the market for certain technology products and services may have only recently begun to develop is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants additionally certain technology companies may have only recently commenced operations or offered securities to the public such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited operating history on which to analyze future operating results it is important to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading accordingly there can be no assurance that upon redemption of units or termination of a trust a unitholder will receive an amount greater than or equal to the unitholders initial investment based on trading history factors such as announcements of new products or development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to fluctuate substantially market volatility may adversely affect the market price of the securities and therefore the ability of a unitholder to redeem units or roll over units into a new trust at a price equal to or greater than the original price paid for such units some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently available only from single sources there can be no assurance that in the future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner accordingly an issuers operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for or and interruption or reduction in supply of any key components additionally many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or reduction of sales because many products and technologies are incorporated into other related products certain companies are often highly dependent on the performance of other computer electronics and communications companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders form other customers similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition between companies accordingly a decline in demand of such products technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the securities telecommunications issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies the telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation and the products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence these factors could affect the value of units telephone companies in the united states for example are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products as a result competitive pressures are intense and the values of telecommunications company securities are subject to rapid price volatility several highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise while a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers of traditional telecommunication products and services a trust may also invest in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development of new products and services these smaller companies may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation and may also involve greater risk than large established issuers such smaller companies may have limited product lines market or financial resources and their securities may trade less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger more established companies as a result the prices of the securities of such smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other issuers in addition recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by a trust utility and energy issuers because certain trusts may invest significantly in bonds issued by public utility and energy companies an investment in units of certain trusts should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of the public utility and energy industries and the risks which such an investment may entail general problems of the public utility and energy industries include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the public service commissions having jurisdiction the difficulty in financing large construction programs during an inflationary period the restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental nuclear safety and other regulatory considerations the difficulty of the capital markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities the difficulty in obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer and the effects of energy conservation there is no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating and other expenses and debt service requirements all of the public utilities which are issuers of securities in certain trusts have been experiencing many of these problems in varying degrees furthermore utility and energy stocks are particularly susceptible to interest rate risk generally exhibiting an inverse relationship to interest rates as a result electric utility stock prices may be adversely affected as interest rates rise similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition between companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers accordingly a decline in demand of such products technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of securities in certain trusts utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which for example establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base which must be approved by the state commissions certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time in persuading regulators who are subject to political pressures to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance in addition gas pipeline and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies enforcing or being required to comply with longterm contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers on the one hand or suppliers on the other certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years these utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business these opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of return some companies however may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable certain of the issuers of securities in certain trusts may own or operate nuclear generating facilities governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional requirements governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants nuclear generating projects in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases construction delays and licensing difficulties these have been caused by various factors including inflation high financing costs required design changes and rework allegedly faulty construction objections by groups and governmental officials limits on the ability to finance reduced forecasts of energy requirements and economic conditions this experience indicates that the risk of significant cost increases delays and licensing difficulties remain present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear project also nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining regulatory approval to return to service a major accident at a nuclear plant anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation construction or licensing of nuclear units in view of the uncertainties discussed above there can be no assurance that any utility companys share of the full cost of nuclear units under construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units the likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of concern described above varies as does the potential severity of any adverse impact it should be recognized however that one or more of such adverse events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on a companys financial condition the results of its operations its ability to make interest and principal payments on its outstanding debt or to pay dividends other general problems of the electric gas and water utility industries including state and local joint action power agencies include rising costs of rail transportation to transport fossil fuels the uncertainty of transmission service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions changes in tax laws which adversely affect a utilitys ability to operate profitably increased competition in service costs recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations uncertain availability and increased cost of capital unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal availability and cost of natural gas for resale technical and cost factors and other problems associated with construction licensing regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation including among other considerations the problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive wastes and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of any utility and energy bonds to make dividend payments and the value of such issues on redemption of your units taxable municipal issues certain bonds in a trust may consist of taxable obligations of municipal issuers obligations of municipal issuers can be either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary build america bonds were issued pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the recovery act authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the treasury department and the internal revenue service irs in an amount equal to  percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors  percent for those build america bonds that qualify and are designated as recovery zone economic development bonds the recovery act adds a new section to the internal revenue code of  as amended the code which authorizes build america bonds that meet the definition of qualified bonds as described below to receive the refundable credit the code section defines the term qualified bond to mean a build america bond a issued before january   b with  percent of the excess of i the available project proceeds as defined to mean sale proceeds of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon over ii the amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue are to be used for capital expenditures and c where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to have this subsection of the code apply should a build america bond issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed by the internal revenue code of  as amended it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments in addition build america bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to sections aa or  of the code as added by the recovery act or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a build america bond issuers borrowing costs qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds collectively qualified bonds are taxable bonds that are similar to certain build america bonds in that state and municipal qualified bond issuers may elect to receive direct interestsubsidy payments from the us treasury if certain conditions are met the hiring incentives to restore employment act enacted into federal law on march   permits issuers of qualified bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest payments qualified school construction bonds issued pursuant to provisions in the recovery act are issued to finance the construction rehabilitation or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bondfinanced facility will be constructed qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds are both issued pursuant to the energy improvement and extension act of  and like qualified school construction bonds are governed by section a of the code qualified energy conservation bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes and clean renewable energy bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity although the year of issuance is not restricted for qualified bonds federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types federal legislation has amended the code in recent years to provide for certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of qualified bonds and to include such bonds under the definition of qualified tax credit bond as found in section a of the code eligible issuers of qualified school construction bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury eligible issuers of qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury should the issuer of a qualified bond fail continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the code or other federal laws it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds as provided in section a of the code qualified bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance this mandatory redemption must be completed within  days after such threeyear period unless an extension is granted by the treasury additionally qualified bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any qualified bond issuers borrowing costs certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest ginnie mae securities the ginnie mae securities included in a gnma income portfolio are backed by the indebtedness secured by underlying mortgage pools of up to  year mortgages on  to family dwellings the securities are often referred to simply as ginnie maes the pool of mortgages which is to underlie a particular new issue of ginnie mae securities is assembled by the proposed issuer of such ginnie mae securities the issuer is typically a mortgage banking firm and in every instance must be a mortgagee approved by and in good standing with the federal housing administration fha in addition ginnie mae imposes its own criteria on the eligibility of issuers including a net worth requirement the mortgages which are to comprise a new ginnie mae pool may have been originated by the issuer itself in its capacity as a mortgage lender or may be acquired by the issuer from a third party such as another mortgage banker a banking institution the veterans administration va which in certain instances acts as a direct lender and thus originates its own mortgages or one of several other governmental agencies all mortgages in any given pool will be insured under the national housing act as amended fhainsured or title v of the housing act of  fmha insured or guaranteed under the servicemens readjustment act of  as amended or chapter  of title  usc vaguaranteed such mortgages will have a date for the first scheduled monthly payment of principal that is not more than one year prior to the date on which ginnie mae issues its guaranty commitment as described below will have comparable interest rates and maturity dates and will meet additional criteria of ginnie mae all mortgages in the pools backing the ginnie mae securities contained in the trust are mortgages on  to family dwellings having a stated maturity of up to  years for securities in the trust but an estimated average life of considerably less in general the mortgages in these pools provide for equal monthly payments over the life of the mortgage aside from prepayments designed to repay the principal of the mortgage over such period together with interest at the fixed rate on the unpaid balance to obtain ginnie mae approval of a new pool of mortgages the issuer will file with ginnie mae an application containing information concerning itself describing generally the pooled mortgages and requesting that ginnie mae approve the issue and issue its commitment subject to ginnie maes satisfaction with the mortgage documents and other relevant documentation to guarantee the timely payment of principal of and interest on the ginnie mae securities to be issued by the issuer if the application is in order ginnie mae will issue its commitment and will assign a ginnie mae pool number to the pool upon completion of the required documentation including detailed information as to the underlying mortgages a custodial agreement with a federal or state regulated financial institution satisfactory to ginnie mae pursuant to which the underlying mortgages will be held in safekeeping and a detailed guaranty agreement between ginnie mae and the issuer the issuance of the ginnie mae securities is permitted when the ginnie mae securities are issued ginnie mae will endorse its guarantee thereon the aggregate principal amount of ginnie mae securities issued will be equal to the then aggregate unpaid principal balances of the pooled mortgages the interest rate borne by the ginnie mae securities is currently fixed at  of  below the interest rate of the pooled  to family mortgages the differential being applied to the payment of servicing and custodial charges as well as ginnie maes guaranty fee ginnie mae iis consist of jumbo pools of mortgages from more than one issuer by allowing pools to consist of multiple issuers it allows for larger and more geographically diverse pools unlike ginnie mae is which have a minimum pool size of  million ginnie mae iis have a minimum pool size of  million in addition the interest rates on the mortgages within the ginnie mae ii pools will vary unlike the mortgages within pools in ginnie mae is which all have the same rate the rates on the mortgages will vary from  of  to  above the coupon rate on the ginnie mae security which is allowed for servicing and custodial fees as well as the ginnie maes guaranty fee the major advantage of ginnie mae iis lies in the fact that a central paying agent sends one check to the holder on the required payment date this greatly simplifies the current procedure of collecting distributions from each issuer of a ginnie mae since such distributions are often received late all of the ginnie mae securities in the trust including the ginnie mae iis are of the fully modified passthrough type ie they provide for timely monthly payments to the registered holders thereof including the trust of their pro rata share of the scheduled principal payments on the underlying mortgages whether or not collected by the issuers including on a pro rata basis any prepayments of principal of such mortgages received and interest net of the servicing and other charges described above on the aggregate unpaid principal balance of such ginnie mae securities whether or not the interest on the underlying mortgages has been collected by the issuers the ginnie mae securities in the trust are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by ginnie mae funds received by the issuers on account of the mortgages backing the ginnie mae securities in the trust are intended to be sufficient to make the required payments of principal of and interest on such ginnie mae securities but if such funds are insufficient for that purpose the guaranty agreements between the issuers and ginnie mae require the issuers to make advances sufficient for such payments if the issuers fail to make such payments ginnie mae will do so ginnie mae is authorized by section g of title iii of the national housing act to guarantee the timely payment of and interest on securities which are based on or backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages insured by fha the farmers home administration fmha or guaranteed by the va section g provides further that the full faith and credit of the united states is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guaranty under such subsection an opinion of an assistant attorney general of the united states dated december   states that such guaranties constitute general obligations of the united states backed by its full faith and credit any statement that a particular security is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states is based upon the opinion of an assistant attorney general of the united states and should be so construed ginnie mae is empowered to borrow from the united states treasury to the extent necessary to make any payments of principal and interest required under such guaranties ginnie mae securities are backed by the aggregate indebtedness secured by the underlying fhainsured fmhainsured or vaguaranteed mortgages and except to the extent of funds received by the issuers on account of such mortgages ginnie mae securities do not constitute a liability of nor evidence any recourse against such issuers but recourse thereon is solely against ginnie mae holders of ginnie mae securities such as the trust have no security interest in or lien on the underlying mortgages the ginnie mae guaranties referred to herein relate only to payment of principal of and interest on the ginnie mae securities in the trust and not to the units offered hereby monthly payments of principal will be made and additional prepayments of principal may be made to each trust in respect of the mortgages underlying the ginnie mae securities in the trust all of the mortgages in the pools relating to the ginnie mae securities in the trust are subject to prepayment without any significant premium or penalty at the option of the mortgagors while the mortgages on  to family dwellings underlying the ginnie mae securities have a stated maturity of up to  years for the trust it has been the experience of the mortgage industry that the average life of comparable mortgages owing to prepayments refinancings and payments from foreclosures is considerably less in the mids published yield tables for ginnie mae securities utilized a  year average life assumption for ginnie mae pools of  year mortgages on  to family dwellings this assumption was derived from the fha experience relating to prepayments on such mortgages during the period from the mids to the mids this year average life assumption was calculated in respect of a period during which mortgage lending rates were fairly stable the assumption is no longer an accurate measure of the average life of ginnie mae securities or their underlying single family mortgage pools recently it has been observed that mortgages issued at high interest rates have experienced accelerated prepayment rates which would indicate a significantly shorter average life than  years today research analysts use complex formulae to scrutinize the prepayments of mortgage pools in an attempt to predict more accurately the average life of ginnie mae securities a number of factors including homeowners mobility change in family size and mortgage market interest rates will affect the average life of the ginnie mae securities in the trust for example ginnie mae securities issued during a period of high interest rates will be backed by a pool of mortgage loans bearing similarly high rates in general during a period of declining interest rates new mortgage loans with interest rates lower than those charged during periods of high rates will become available to the extent a homeowner has an outstanding mortgage with a high rate he may refinance his mortgage at a lower interest rate or he may rapidly repay his old mortgage should this happen a ginnie mae issued with a high interest rate may experience a rapid prepayment of principal as the underlying mortgage loans prepay in whole or in part accordingly there can be no assurance that the prepayment levels which will be actually realized will conform to the estimates or experience of the fha other mortgage lenders dealers or market makers or other ginnie mae investors it is not possible to meaningfully predict prepayment levels regarding the ginnie mae securities in the trust the termination of the trust might be accelerated as a result of prepayments made as described herein insurance on the bonds insurance has been obtained by each insured trust by the issuer of bonds in certain trusts by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such insured trust see the trustsobjective and bond selection in the prospectus each insurance policy obtained by an insured trust if any is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as such insured trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such insured trust see portfolio for the trust in the prospectus part i nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by an insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such insured trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an insured trust are fixed for the life of an insured trust the premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer and any such policy or policies are noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the portfolio insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due for the purposes of the portfolio insurance when due generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the portfolio insurer involved has the option in its sole discretion for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from an insured trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by an insured trust is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such insured trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise an insured trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basis the insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to an insured trust in that each bond insured by an insured trust insurance policy may be sold out of the insured trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to such insured trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event an insured trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that the insured trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if the insured trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in the prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of an insured trust if the insured trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default the insured trust would not need to hold such bonds until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the insured trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in the prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bond not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii for a more complete description of an insured trusts method of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of

sec available on the edgar database on the secs internet site at httpwwwsecgov the extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by jurisdiction but new york and most other jurisdictions have laws and regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of dividends transactions with affiliates mergers consolidations acquisitions or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings in order to be in an insured trust bonds must be insured by one of the preinsured bond insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by such trust if any in determining eligibility for insurance the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers have applied their own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of bonds by the sponsor to the extent the standards of the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers are more restrictive than those of the sponsor the previously stated trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds this decision is made prior to the date of deposit as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an insured trust thus all of the bonds in the portfolios of the insured trusts are insured either by the respective trust or by the issuer of the bonds by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust an objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust is to obtain a higher yield on the portfolio of such trust than would be available if all the bonds in such portfolio had sp aaa rating and yet at the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and principal when due on the bonds there is of course no certainty that this result will be achieved preinsured bonds in an insured trust all of which are rated aaa by sp may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds rated aaa by sp in selecting such bonds for an insured trust the sponsor has applied the criteria hereinbefore described in the event of nonpayment of interest or principal when due in respect of a bond a portfolio insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened but not earlier than the date such payment is due the insurer as regards any payment it may make will succeed to the rights of the trustee in respect thereof all policies issued by the portfolio insurers if any and the preinsured bond insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an insured trust are concerned the internal revenue service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal obligations paid to holders of insured bonds under policy provisions substantially identical to the policies described herein will be excludable from federal gross income under section a of the code to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal obligations holders of units in an insured trust should discuss with their tax advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling however counsel for the sponsor at the time of the closing of the insured trust had given an opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from federal gross income to the extent described under federal tax status in prospectus part ii each portfolio insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business such regulation however is no guarantee that each portfolio insurer will be able to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some time in the future at the date hereof it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the portfolio insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance the information relating to each portfolio insurer has been furnished by such companies the financial information with respect to each portfolio insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities no representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof portfolio administration the trustee is empowered to sell for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be available such of the bonds designated by the evaluator as the trustee in its sole discretion may deem necessary the evaluator in designating such bonds will consider a variety of factors including a interest rates b market value and c marketability to the extent that bonds are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds the overall quality of the bonds remaining in the trusts portfolio will tend to diminish the sponsor is empowered but not obligated to direct the trustee to dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan except that the sponsor may instruct the trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as the sponsor may deem proper if  the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or  in the written opinion of the sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the reasonably foreseeable future any bond so received in exchange or substitution will be held by the trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the trust agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder within five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying bonds the trustee is required to give notice thereof to each unitholder identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor except as stated herein and under trust administrationreplacement bonds in prospectus part ii regarding the substitution of replacement bonds for failed bonds the acquisition by the trust of any bonds other than the bonds initially deposited is not permitted if any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio insurance or otherwise within  days the trustee is required to notify the sponsor thereof if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within  days after notification by the trustee to the sponsor of such default the trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred sponsor information

financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances the longterm debt obligation

accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinate obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly
