regulation  pages posted  nov    gregory connor national university of ireland maynooth nui maynooth  department of economicsbrian g okelly dublin city university date written november   abstract this paper develops a restrictive procedure for evaluating economic policy decisions by comparing actual economic history to a simulated history where a specific policy decision is replaced with a counterfactual but credible alternative our procedure is theoretically straightforward but empirically problematic since it requires the identification of a feasible policy alternative and a model linking a specific policy choice to subsequent economic outcomes we apply the procedure to the mistaken decision to maintain an excessively lax financial regulation regime in ireland during the period  we measure the differences in banking sector stability and national income that would have occurred if the stricter regulatory regime imposed in ireland in  had been put in place six years earlier we find that a few simple reasonably prudent regulatory controls on the irish banking sector would have greatly limited the vulnerability of the domestic sector to the  global credit freeze and almost certainly prevented the  collapse of the domestic banking sector and the consequent deep irish recession of  on the other hand the risky and unsustainable inflow of foreign capital mediated by the domestic banks accounts for a substantial part of irish economic growth during the  period without this net foreign borrowing inflow cumulative gross domestic product over the early period would have been substantially lower keywords financial regulation banking crisis jel classification e g g suggested citation suggested citation connor gregory and okelly brian g sliding doors cost measurement a
