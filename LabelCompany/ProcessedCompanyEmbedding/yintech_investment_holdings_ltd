about to disappear sean williams tmfultralong apr   at pm what happened shares of yintech investment holdings nasdaqyin a chinabased company that allows investors to buy and sell preciousmetal commodities online such as gold and silver tumbled as much as  during mondays trading session the culprit appears to be an april dated k filing with the securities and exchange commission so what according to todays filing yintech was notified by the guangdong precious metals exchange one of three exchanges that the company operates on that it had adjusted its spot commodity trading business in light of new market development and in particular it will terminate the trading of all the current products on the exchange on may   it continued as a result we will no longer be able to generate revenue from our business carried out on the guangdong precious metals exchange after may   image source getty images according to yintechs k filing the guangdong exchange accounted for  of the companys commissions and fees last year and as of march  this figure was down to  of commissions and fees the filing suggests uncertainty on whether new products will be introduced at some point in the future or even how the new trading rules will affect the guangdong exchange in the interim yintech plans to divert its capital investments away from the guangdong exchange and toward the shanghai gold exchange and tianjin precious metals exchange which are unaffected by todays news now what todays news is yet another reminder of how unpredictable china and its investments can be at times yintech according to wall streets estimates was on track to earn  in eps this year which made it one of the best bargains on paper based on a pe comparison to other investment service providers however todays news clearly changes the game yintech is set to lose about a quarter of its revenue and theres little telling what that might do to the companys profits at this point as a faint glimmer of hope it is possible that we see business from guangdong diverted to the other two preciousmetal exchanges thus minimizing the impact of todays news in the months to come the problem is we just dont know and this uncertainty is whats fueling the highly emotional trading of investors today in yintechs stock hopefully well get a little more bottomline clarity from management in the weeks to come

or demand deposits the online spot commodity trading market is highly competitive and fragmented for trading service providers like us as of december   there were over  active trading service providers that operate on over  exchanges nationwide the trading service providers compete with each other for customers and trading volume based on factors including brand technology research and customer services according to euromonitor we were the largest online provider of spot commodity trading services in china by customer trading volume in  with a market share of approximately  in terms of trading volume of individual investors we had a market share in terms of trading volume of individual investors of approximately  on the tianjin precious metals exchange and approximately  on the guangdong precious metals exchange in  our customer trading volume on tianjin precious metals exchange was the largest among all service providers on the exchange from  to  our customer trading volume on guangdong precious metals exchange ranked among all service providers no  in  no  in the first nine months of  and no  in the fourth quarter of  our customer trading volume on the shanghai gold exchange has been growing rapidly since our recent commencement of operation on the exchange in november  in addition there are also over  commercial banks operating as financial members on the shanghai gold exchange through which individual customers can open accounts and trade gold and other precious metals on that exchange however we believe that in most cases these banks only offer a trading channel to their existing customers as part of their overall banking package and do not provide specialized services for spot commodity trading recently attracted by a booming online spot commodity trading market certain internet companies such as netease inc also launched a spot commodity trading service differing from our strategy of focusing on premier customers netease sets low deposit requirements for account opening and gained a large customer base with small average invested amounts in a relatively short period although some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or a larger customer bases than we do we believe that our proprietary technology platform our focus on premier customers our comprehensive customer services and strong brand recognition in the industry will enable us to compete effectively in the fast evolving online spot commodity trading industry in the prc company description we are the largest online provider of spot commodity trading services in china by customer trading volume in both  and  according to euromonitor we currently facilitate the trading by individual customers of silver gold and other precious metals and commodities on three leading exchanges in china namely the shanghai gold exchange the tianjin precious metals exchange and the guangdong precious metals exchange which were the three largest exchanges for online spot commodity trading in china in terms of trading volume in  respectively we were the largest service provider by customer trading volume on the tianjin precious metals exchange from  to  and the largest service provider on the guangdong precious metals exchange in the fourth quarter of  we commenced our operation on the shanghai gold exchange in november  and our customer trading volume has been growing rapidly since then online spot commodity trading recently emerged as an alternative investment product in china with aggregate trading volume growing at a cagr of  from  to  and reaching rmb trillion us trillion in  we believe such growth is largely attributable to the distinctive features of online spot commodity trading its depositbased leverage trading method offers relatively high volatility trading opportunities which appeal to a group of individual investors compared with other leveraged trading products such as futures spot commodity trading enjoys the following benefits i its underlying assets primarily silver and gold are more familiar to individual investors ii the spot commodity contract is less complex and iii its trading hours are longer and continuous compared with chinas commodity futures markets which had an aggregate trading volume of rmb trillion us trillion in  the spot commodity market is still small and we believe it has strong growth potential we focus on premier customers and generally require each customer to deposit at least rmb us for account activation based on our experience the total invested amount of a customer is often significantly higher we believe this strategy helps us focus our resources on providing better services and build a base of customers with greater sophistication and risk tolerance who are more suited to leveraged spot commodity trading as of december   there were more than  customers who opened and activated accounts with us among which more than  executed trades during the year ended december   with an aggregate trading volume of rmb billion us billion we provide our customers with comprehensive services including account opening investor education market information research live discussion boards and realtime customer support most services are delivered online through our proprietary client software and call center and we do not operate physical branches our client software

our customers engagement internally we collect and analyze customer behavior and communications data from our client software customer relationship management system and the exchanges which allow us
