for  years a fund manager is cleared by rachel abrams may    pm may    pm photonelson obus put on his victory tie on friday outside federal court in manhattan after being cleared of insider tradingcredit rachel abramsthe new york times updated  pm  standing outside a manhattan federal court on friday nelson obus put on his victory tie a jury of five men and five women had just cleared him of insider trading accusations which mr obus a yearold hedge fund manager had spent more than  years and  million battling in court the bright red tie he had told his lawyers earlier in the day was for his “win” the outspoken mr obus who earlier in the day wore striped socks a light gray suit and a dark blue tie with pictures of constellations breathed a loud sigh of relief as the decision was read his wife eve coulson sat stonefaced behind him mr obus’s anger at the securities and exchange commission which first filed suit against him in  soon became apparent “if you had been doing your job this never would have happened” mr obus yelled at the sec’s lawyers even as his representatives tried to quiet him “i’ve had my whole life wrapped up in this” an sec spokesman john nester said “although we are disappointed we respect the jury’s verdict” the jury also cleared one of mr obus’s employees and a former underwriter at general electric concluding that they had not provided mr obus with nonpublic information about the  sale of sunsource a seller of industrial products based in philadelphia the decision represents the end of an extraordinarily longrunning insider trading case the sec first subpoenaed mr obus in  and filed a formal complaint nearly five years later one month shy of the statute of limitations only one of the sec’s lawyers present on friday worked on the case in  clearly emotional mr obus read a long prepared statement outside the courtroom at times veering off script to talk about his childhood and his father a retail stockbroker whom mr obus said had never had a runin with the law “i know somewhere up there my father’s smiling today” mr obus told reporters mr obus also called the sec’s lawsuit a “year campaign of regulatory overreach” and thanked the investors who had stuck with his firm wynnefield partners throughout the years seven percent of investors withdrew their money from wynnefield because of the insider trading case mr obus said “we need to assure the business community that regulators can’t wrongly force small enterprises to settle or falsely admit guilt” mr obus said this is the second prominent defeat for the sec in an insider trading trial in the last year last october a federal jury in dallas found mark cuban the billionaire owner of the dallas mavericks basketball team not liable of insider trading in another drawnout legal battle the sec accused mr obus of using an insider tip to buy stock in sunsource weeks ahead of its sale to allied capital a trade that earned him a  million profit the sec contended that thomas b strickland who worked at ge tipped his friend peter f black who worked for mr obus’s firm about the impending deal mr black’s mother was present throughout the trial and held her face in her hand when the decision was read as she fought back tears mr obus could have settled the case years ago but chose instead to fight to prove his innocence a federal judge george b daniels even sided with mr obus in  ruling that the sec had failed to prove that there was sufficient evidence of insider trading but the government won on appeal two years later judge daniels presided over mr obus’s trial “the only reason they did this is because they didn’t think we could win” mr obus said as people began filing out of the courtroom mr obus has never looked or acted like a typical wall street insider his appearance leans more toward disheveled than polished and on friday his belt was repeatedly unbuckled as he came in and out of the courtroom during the trial he testified that wynnefield’s new york office had not changed its furniture since the company was founded in  on friday mr obus came prepared for victory showing off the bright red “win tie” he changed into soon after the jury’s

hedge funds  legalregulatory the curious case of nelson obus by susanne craig june    pm june    pm nelson obus is on no one’s list of wall street titans he is just another guy who chased that golden dream catch the morning train into manhattan run a small but prosperous hedge fund catch the evening train out back to a leafy island of suburban wealth but on the morning of july   a fedex package from washington arrived at his midtown office and his world collapsed beneath him mr obus is the target of an insider trading investigation he insisted from the start that he had done nothing wrong but almost a decade later he is still fighting to clear his name his case has become one of the longestrunning civil actions by the securities and exchange commission in recent memory — a sort of “les miserables” of wall street chang w leethe new york timesaccused of insider trading in  nelson obus refuses to settle “that is the same as guilty to me” “this has turned into a nightmare” mr obus  says he has run up  million in legal bills it might be difficult to rouse much sympathy for the likes of nelson obus federal authorities after all say insider trading is rampant on wall street particularly among hedge funds like his hardly a week passes without the revelation of some financial skullduggery many ordinary americans wonder why more wall street highfliers are not in trouble — or behind bars — after all those taxpayer bailouts and mortgage shenanigans few people aside from the accused argue that the authorities should go easy on financial black hats who swindled investors to the contrary many say the sec and others have not been tough enough next to the fiascos of the financial collapse insider trading almost seems oldfashioned some legal experts suspect the sec is pursuing insider trading cases to in effect make up for past failures like sleeping through the huge ponzi scheme that bernard l madoff ran for so long “regulators didn’t do well with the ponzi schemes with the madoffs of the world” says robert a prentice a professor at the university of texas at austin “insider trading cases are something they know how to do” all of which makes the case of nelson obus all the more curious whether mr obus is guilty of trading stocks on an insider’s tip a decade ago depends on whom you ask the sec insists he is and filed a case against him in  but a federal judge late last year sided with mr obus ruling that the commission had failed to provide sufficient evidence and throwing out the case unbowed the sec has appealed that decision a commission spokesman declined to comment on the case not since the days of ivan f boesky in the s has insider trading been discussed so much on or off wall street the twomonth trial of raj rajaratnam the billionaire money manager who was convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy in may seemed only to confirm many people’s worst fears about this business the game is rigged mr rajaratnam is appealing his conviction last month an employee at the nasdaq stock market pleaded guilty to trading on information he had gleaned from his perch in the exchange and so the obus case which began years before the housing market sputtered lehman brothers collapsed and mr rajaratnam was indicted rolls on it has pitted mr obus a man of considerable financial resources and apparently a will to fight against an sec that is eager to show that it is back on the beat what is insider trading anyway most people probably view the actions embraced by that term much the way supreme court justice potter stewart summed up pornography they know it when they see it someone gets a tip and trades on it case closed legally it is not so simple in the united states insider trading was not even addressed in the law until the s and it was not until the s that the authorities began to crack down on the crime here is how the sec defines insider trading on its web site “illegal insider trading refers generally to buying or selling a security in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence while in possession of material nonpublic information about the security” federal prosecutors won a conviction of mr rajaratnam with an approach more often associated with organized crime figures than stock traders wiretaps they produced hours of recorded telephone conversations that to the jury showed that mr rajaratnam the founder of the galleon group hedge fund had used a vast network of executives and experts to glean information few insider trading cases are so clearcut a vast majority more closely resemble the case against mr obus it centers on a corporate acquisition in  that will be remembered as a footnote in the annals of finance if it is remembered at all the sec says his hedge fund made  million trading on an inside tip about the deal most people who are accused of insider trading make a deal with the authorities rather than face a jury as mr rajaratnam did a settlement often involves forfeiting illgotten gains paying a fine and being prohibited from serving as a director of a public company there is of course an unwritten penalty the one exacted by the marketplace even a whisper of insider trading allegations can effectively end careers and kill hedge funds after getting caught up in the widening insider trading investigation level global investors a  billion hedge fund in new york liquidated its entire portfolio and closed in february mr obus could have settled with the sec he still could but he insists he will not despite the urgings of friends and family members in most cases people settle without admitting or denying wrongdoing “that is the same as guilty to me” mr obus says nelson obus does not look like gordon gekko he does not sound like gordon gekko in fact mr obus comes across as a sort of an antigekko he rarely tucks in his shirt and often has dirt under his fingernails his reading glasses which have rhinestones at the temples came from the women’s display at duane reade he grew up in wynnefield pa a suburb of philadelphia in a downwardly mobile family that had made then lost a fortune in the wool business after earning a master’s in political science from brandeis university mr obus turned down a job on wall street and taught natural history for organizations like the massachusetts audubon society then in  a friend from philadelphia offered him a job at the investment bank lazard and mr obus decided it was time to “come in from the woods” eleven years later in  he struck out on his own founding a hedge fund wynnefield partners named after his old neighborhood today the firm manages  million in assets sunsource of philadelphia was never a sexy company it mostly sold industrial products like nuts and bolts but mr obus knew the company because it was based where he grew up and he had bought nearly  percent of it then in may  the allied capital corporation an oldline investment firm began circling sunsource and mr obus according to the sec’s complaint made a fateful decision the general electric company which has a big finance arm was looking to bankroll an alliedsunsource deal brad strickland an associate at ge noticed wynnefield owned a lot of sunsource stock and spoke to a friend there peter f black both insist they did not talk about the pending merger “it was pretty vague” mr black later told investigators of the conversation he said he was simply doing broad due diligence on sunsource mr black told mr obus that he had had a call from someone at ge who had questions about sunsource’s management mr obus picked up the phone and called the chief executive of sunsource according to the sec mr obus told him that “a little birdie” had told him sunsource might be in play mr obus has a different recollection he says he told the executive that he had heard sunsource was thinking of a financing arrangement which he felt might hurt existing shareholders whatever the case wynnefield bought more sunsource stock two weeks later at  a share a few weeks after that allied capital announced its buyout of sunsource and the stock almost doubled just how the sec caught wind of mr obus’s trade is unclear mr obus says he did not think about the deal again until the fedex package arrived from washington  months later in its complaint against mr obus mr black and mr strickland the sec claimed the men had “knowingly or recklessly violated” securities laws mr obus’s lawyer joel m cohen countered that mr strickland had not violated any duty to ge there is no evidence mr cohen said that he said anything that would violate his duty to ge and ge had not entered into a confidentiality agreement with sunsource the lawyer also says that mr obus had never deceitfully traded on the information a crucial component of the legal definition of insider trading in fact mr obus went as far as to call the ceo of the target company and tell him what he knew “mad dog” that is what people inside the sec and out on wall street call leo wang mr wang was an enforcer at the sec and his doggedness has won him some prominent victories he was a player in bringing down dennis levine a powerful investment banker and prominent figure in the insider trading scandals of boesky era mr wang says he “vaguely remembers” the obus case in documents filed in connection with the case the sec painted a picture of an insider trading conspiracy they claimed that mr strickland and mr black met over drinks at the bryant park grill in midtown to coordinate responses to the sec both men say they met but did not coordinate lawyers for the men declined to comment mr obus’s lawyer mr cohen said he told mr wang early on that the sec had a weak case why would mr obus call the chief executive of sunsource and say he had been tipped “there is no understanding the reasoning of a criminal mind” mr wang replied according to mr cohen mr wang says that is not something he would say for a time the matter seemed to die then in april  a month before the statute of limitations was to expire the sec filed insider trading charges against the three men all of whom have not settled “we are simply astounded that this lawsuit was filed at all” mr obus wrote in a letter to his fund investors on april   one of the last things anyone wants to hear about people who manage their money is that they have been accused of wrongdoing some wynnefield investors headed for the exits withdrawing about  million from the fund “we deeply regret to have to inform you of our intent to withdraw  percent of our interest” a big investor wrote in an email to wynnefield that april “our investment guidelines prevent us from investing with managers that are the subject of regulatory actions like the suit filed by the sec” later as the financial crisis struck jpmorgan chase severed ties with wynnefield mr obus says so did republic national bank mr obus an activist investor who sometimes seeks board seats also was rebuffed by corner offices for instance crown crafts which makes baby products told shareholders to reject mr obus as a board member because of the sec action in april  linda c thomsen the director of enforcement at the sec testified on capitol hill about insider trading in her written testimony which appeared on the sec’s web site she said mr obus had settled with the commission he hadn’t “i was speechless when i saw this” mr obus recalled the sec later amended the testimony on its site dejected mr obus went to visit a business acquaintance kenneth langone the founder of home depot mr langone had had his own scrapes with the authorities mr langone showed mr obus a transcript of a deposition with eliot spitzer the new york attorney general at the time who in  had accused mr langone of misleading fellow directors of the new york stock exchange mr langone had settled claims brought against him in the ’s which were dredged up in the spitzer deposition mr langone told mr obus he has always regretted settling those charges in the ’s both men say nelson obus finally got his day in court in september in a page decision judge george b daniels of federal district court wrote that the sec had failed to demonstrate that mr strickland the supposed tipper had breached a duty to either sunsource or ge “the sec acknowledges that its case is based in large part upon circumstantial evidence that a duty existed” the judge said additionally the sec failed to prove that mr obus had tried to deceive anyone the sec has appealed judge daniel’s decision a final decision could come this year mr obus says he will not give up now he says he still remembers the advice that mr langone gave him in  “you will find that defending your character is a good use of financial resources” whats next loading previous post fed weighs high
