yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings has affirmed the longterm issuer default ratings idrs of kkr  co lp and its related entities collectively kkr at a the rating outlook is stable concurrently fitch has affirmed the longterm idr of kkr financial holdings llc kfn at a the rating outlook is stable a complete list of ratings is detailed at the end of this release todays rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic peer review of the alternative investment manager im industry which comprises seven publicly rated global firms fitchs outlook for the sector is stable reflecting the relative stability of core operating fundamentals given the lockedin nature of a large portion of fee revenue modest but increased leverage levels manageable near term obligations relative to available liquidity resources increasing asset under management aum diversity and investors increasing allocation to alternative investments particularly those managed by alternative ims with strong franchises such as those included in fitchs peer review feeearning aum faum growth has slowed considerably for the rated peer group as numerous strategies have record levels of uncalled capital to invest fundraising is expected to moderate to some extent as a result but management fees are expected to retain their resiliency as capital notyetearning management fees shadow aum remains elevated and realizations of legacy investments have declined while an increase in market dislocations would impact the valuations and realization of existing investments it could also result in stronger management fee growth as uncalled capital would be invested at a faster pace fitch does not expect a widespread distress cycle to emerge over the near term the variable cost structure of the alternative ims has contributed to relatively steady cash flows through cycles feerelated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization febitda margins rebounded modestly in  and  as many alternative ims have begun to realize the scale benefits of followon funds and adjacent strategies the febitda margin for a category alternative ims averaged  for the trailing  months ttm ended sept   which compared to a  average for  and fitchs quantitative benchmark range of  for a category alternative ims still dispersion in the group is significant with a more than  percentage point differential between the highest and lowest performer driven by differences in strategy and product mix fitch believes higher margins provide enhanced operating flexibility through cycles gross realized incentive income has steadily declined since peaking in  driven by the length of time valuations have been at elevated levels a less supportive ipo environment and a reduction in the average age of fund investments exit activity has declined in  and is likely to moderate further which points to likely reductions in distributable earnings incentive income accruals remain strong and fitch believes realized incentive income may be less volatile than precrisis experience given the increased diversity of product platforms leverage levels have increased across the industry as issuers have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue long duration funding for the purpose of funding balance sheet coinvestments acquisitions and in some instances to prefund maturities average leverage defined as debt divided by febitda was  times x for a category firms for the ttm ending sept   which compares to fitchs quantitative benchmark range of xx for a category alternative ims fitch believes the issuances have been largely opportunistic and views the reduction in refinancing risk favorably over time fitch expects leverage levels to generally decline to the benchmark range as febitda growth is driven by cost controls increased scale continued fundraising and the gradual deployment of faum that earns fees on invested capital counterbalancing the uptick in leverage is the maintenance of strong liquidity profiles several firms remain in a negative net debt position and  saw the introduction of perpetual preferred issuances by two issuers in the sector with proceeds to date used to improve operating flexibility and liquidity debt maturities are negligible for the sector in  payout ratios remain relatively high but fitch believes alternative ims retain the ability to reduce shareholder distributions as necessary to meet obligations while several share repurchase programs were announced over the last  months execution of the programs is expected to remain opportunistic and is not expected to impair the sectors overall liquidity key rating drivers idrs and senior debt the rating affirmations for kkr reflect its strong competitive position as a global alternative im experienced management team solid investment track record relatively predictable feeearnings stream given sizeable faum incentive incomegenerating capability strong asset coverage of debt ample liquidity relatively low balance sheet leverage and subordination of general partner interests to outstanding indebtedness rating constraints for the alternative im space include key man risk which is institutionalized throughout many limited partnership agreements reputational risk which can impact the companys ability to raise future funds and legal and regulatory risk which could alter the alternative asset space rating constraints more specific to kkr include lower relative aum diversity higher cash flow leverage and some sizeable investment concentrations on the balance sheet the performance of which are highly correlated to kkrs investment management performance the affirmation of kfns ratings reflects fitchs view that the entity is strategically important to kkr as outlined in fitchs global nonbank financial institutions rating criteria in accordance with the criteria a subsidiary considered to be of strategic importance is rated one notch below its parent supporting the view of kfns strategic importance to kkr is the sharing of the brand the high level of management integration the expansion of kkrs credit business and the fact that during the recent financial crisis kkr provided explicit financial support to kfn by waiving management fees backstopping an equity raise and providing the firm with a  million liquidity facility fitch believes that kfns small size and more limited investment focus prevent the firm from being considered a core subsidiary at present which would result in equalization of the ratings depending on kfns size strategy and relative earnings contribution to kkr fitchs assessment of kfns strategic importance could evolve over time kkrs business model continues to be differentiated compared with other fitchrated alternative ims as the firm increasingly uses its balance sheet to make investments and generate cash yield at sept   the investment portfolio was about  billion at fair value as the balance sheet is used to seed new investment strategies make strategic investments and finance coinvestment commitments to the funds as a result of this strategy fitch assesses the firms leverage profile on both a cash flow and balance sheet basis at sept   kkrs cash flow leverage debtfebitda was x on a ttm basis adjusting for cash fees received for the management of kfn but eliminated in consolidation kkrs leverage was above the a category peer average of x at the third quarter of  q however fitchs calculation does not give credit for the interest income the firm has been able to generate from its balance sheet investments which is expected to be a somewhat stable recurring source of cash income on a balance sheet leverage basis kkrs debt to tangible equity was x at june   which is low on an absolute basis and at the lowend of the peer group following kkrs acquisition of kfn on april   fitch began evaluating consolidated leverage metrics as part of its assessment of kkrs credit profile at june   kfn had approximately  million of debt providing  equity credit for kfns perpetual preferred securities if kfns debt is added to kkrs debt and kfns recurring ebitda is added to kkrs febitda consolidated cash flow leverage was about x and consolidated balance leverage was x at q while fitch expects kfn will continue to service its own debt and recognizes that the debt is nonrecourse to kkr the agency also believes that there is the possibility that the parent would provide support to its subsidiary should kfn have trouble meeting its debt payments the potential is reflected in fitchs designation of kfn as a strategically important subsidiary of kkr and the resultant one notch differential between kkrs ratings and kfns ratings on oct   kfn announced its intention to redeem in full its  senior notes due  with a principal amount of  million in november  fitch views the redemption favorably as it will reduce kkrs consolidated leverage while kkrs standalone and consolidated cash flow leverage ratios are higher than fitchs quantitative benchmark of xx for alternative ims in the a rating category this is mitigated by the very low balance sheet leverage which results in substantial asset coverage for outstanding debt in addition to contractual management fee streams the expectation of increased febitda and interest income generation over time and kkrs superior liquidity position are additional mitigants kkrs faum amounted to  billion at sept   up  yearoveryear driven by the acquisition of a strategic interest in marshall wace llp and strong fundraising in the public markets segment the increase in faum is noteworthy given the offsetting impact of the continuation of a strong exit environment kkrs total faum distributions to the limited partners of its funds amounted to  billion in  and  billion over the ttm ending sept   net of redemptions as the firm took advantage of a competitive credit environment and strong equity market valuations to exit legacy positions fundraising is expected to remain solid given the increasing diversity of kkrs product offering and the fact that the next generation americas private equity fund is currently raising capital with a thirdparty capital target of  billion kkrs core operating performance was up modestly in the first nine months of  as an increase in management and transaction fees surpassed declines in monitoring fees while transaction and monitoring fees will remain lumpy fitch believes management fees are positioned to grow as kkr had approximately  billion of uncalled capital at sept   that was not yet earning fees if that capital was invested today at kkrs blended fee rate of  it would translate into about  million in net incremental management fees per year according to management estimates despite some variability in the revenue components operating margins are expected to remain relatively consistent given kkrs variablecost structure and the expectation that followon funds will provide higher margins given the absence of more meaningful startup costs kkrs febitda margin was  for the ttm ended sept   which compares favorably to the peer group and is in line with fitchs quantitative benchmark for alternative ims in the a rating category of  carried interest income yeartodate in  was down  versus  levels given the impact of market volatility at the start of the year however realized carried interest income was down a more modest  as strong exit activity continued particularly in the third quarter investment income experienced a  million negative swing in the nine months of the year due largely to a nearly  decline in the share price of first data corporation which remains kkrs largest balance sheet investment these revenue categories will be lumpy over time due to deal activity and market volatility accrued carried interest was  billion at sept   net of associated compensation expense fitch does not view the accrual as a liquid asset but it does point to potential future income generation and cash flow fitch believes kkr has a solid liquidity profile at sept   kkr had nearly  billion of cash and liquid shortterm investments and approximately  billion of available revolving capacity excluding outstanding letters of credit given the cash earnings generation capacity of the firm the lower payout ratio and the limited remaining authorization on the share repurchase program fitch expects the firm to remain in a negative net debt position which fitch views favorably kkr also has a significant amount of investments on its balance sheet about  billion at sept   including kfn a meaningful portion of which is liquid and an increasing portion of which is generating a contractual cash yield for the firm unfunded commitments to funds amounted to approximately  billion at sept   which includes a  billion commitment to americas fund xii which has yet to begin its investment period fitch believes the firm has some discretion over the timing of these fund commitments but expects them to be funded over time with balance sheet liquidity retained cash earnings and a return of investment capital on legacy coinvestments in q kkr altered its distribution policy to a flat  per share per quarter which approximates quarterly fee and yield earnings as a result the firm retains all net realized carry earnings and realized investment income in order to support continued growth in the business including the seeding of new strategies coinvestment commitments and other strategic opportunities fitch views the lower payout favorably as it further strengthens the firms liquidity profile although it does signal a likely meaningful expansion of kkrs already sizeable balance sheet which would further differentiate its business model from peers in concert with the change in the distribution policy kkr also established a  million share repurchase program at sept   remaining authority on the plan amounted to  million execution of the program did reduce balance sheet cash temporarily but cash coffers have since been replenished with the retention of a bigger proportion of cash earnings and the issuance of  million of perpetual preferred securities the stable outlook for kkr reflects fitchs expectation that kkr will continue to generate consistent management fees interest income and feerelated earnings grow faum through followon funds and expansion into new private equity and fixed income products manage cash flow leverage down over time with the generation of incremental fees and cash yields and maintain solid balance sheet leverage and liquidity profiles the stable outlook incorporates an expectation that leverage may remain above the peer average and fitchs general tolerance level of xx for a category rated alternative ims offset by the companys very low balance sheet leverage consistent with fitch hybrid approach to the assessment of the companys credit risk profile the stable outlook for kfn is equalized with kkrs outlook and reflects fitchs expectation of continued strategic importance to kkr subordinated debt and other hybrid securities the affirmation of kkrs preferred stock rating at bbb maintains the two notch differential with kkrs longterm idr in accordance with fitchs treatment and notching of hybrids in nonfinancial corporate and reit credit analysis dated february  the preferred stock rating includes two notches for loss severity reflecting its subordination and heightened risk of nonperformance relative to other obligations namely existing unsecured debt fitch affords the preferred stock issuances  equity credit given the noncumulative nature of the dividends the fact that the preferred securities are perpetual and the existence of a coupon stepup of up to  basis points in the event of a change of control the preferred instruments do not benefit from joint and several guarantees from the kkr group partnerships given the registration requirements however kkr contributed proceeds from the issuances to the kkr group partnerships which each issued to kkr a new series of preferred units with economic terms designed to mirror those of the preferred issuance this included an inability to declare distributions on common units unless distributions have been declared and paid on the preferred units these terms help to provide a credit benefit to offset the lack of a guarantee by structurally prioritizing the preferred units above all common units the affirmation of kfns preferred stock rating at bbb maintains the twonotch differential between the longterm idr and preferred stock rating and reflects the instruments nonperformance risk and loss severity rating sensitivities idrs and senior debt positive rating momentum for kkr could be driven by an increase in fund and fee diversity growth in permanent capital under management which would enhance the predictability of management fees a decline in the proportionate contribution of transaction and monitoring fees to total fees as they tend to be more volatilecyclical increased stability in balance sheet earnings a decline in key man risk and a sustained reduction in cash flow leverage negative rating action for kkr could be driven by declines in investment performance which negatively impact the companys ability to raise faum and generate fees sustained meaningful increases in cash flow or balance sheet leverage as a result of increased debt issuance a failure to generate additional febitda and interest income or balance sheet asset impairment andor material reduction of the firms liquidity profile additionally a material increase in leverage andor significant deterioration in the operating performance of kfn could become a constraining factor for the ratings of kkr subsidiary and affiliated companies the ratings of kfn are directly linked to kkr as fitch considers kfn to be a strategically important subsidiary any change in fitchs view on the relationship between kfn and its parent could alter the rating linkage absent a change in the perceived relationship between kkr and kfn fitch would expect kfns ratings to move in step with any changes to kkrs ratings founded in  kkr is one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world with  billion of faum at sept   the companys common units are listed on the

of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

world war ii which by the s and s were facing succession issues many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders

leading pension funds and other institutional investors investors included cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new

ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco kkrs offer was guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their

cover of their december  issue along with the headline a game of greed this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs favor was little more than an excuse to reject ross johnsons higher payout of

leveraged buyout in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price the

nabiscoedit kkrs headquarters in the solow building at  west th street in new york city the buyout of rjr nabisco was completed in april  and kkr would spend the early s repaying the rjrs enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions after the rjr nabisco deal kkr did not complete a single investment in  the first such year since  they would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert which filed for bankruptcy

added financial flexibility kkr contributed  billion of new equity into rjr in july  to complete a restructuring of the companys balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders kkrs equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of rjr had been only  billion in middecember  rjr announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in rjr for a new public stock in the company effectively an unusual means of taking rjr public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company rjr issued additional stock to the public in march  to further reduce debt resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of rjrs debt from junk to investment grade kkr began to reduce its ownership in rjr in  when its stock in rjr was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of borden inc a producer of food and beverage products consumer products and industrial products in an unprecedented and complex transaction  the following year in  kkr would divest itself of its final stake in rjr nabisco when borden sold a  million block of stock while kkr no longer had any ownership of rjr nabisco by  its original investment would not be fully realized until kkr exited its last investment in  after sixteen years of efforts including contributing new equity taking rjr public asset sales and exchanging shares of rjr for the ownership of borden inc kkr finally sold the last remnants of its  investment in july  kkr agreed to sell its stock in borden chemical to apollo management for  billion early s investmentsedit in the early s the absence of an active high yield market prompted kkr to change its tactics avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups one of kkrs largest investments in the s was the leveraged buildup of primedia in partnership with former executives of macmillan publishing which kkr had failed to acquire in  kkr created primedias predecessor kiii communications a platform to buy media properties initially completing the  million divisional buyout of the book club division of macmillan along with the assets of intertec publishing corporation in

investments in the company in   and  to support acquisition activity in  primedia redeemed kkrs preferred stock in the company but kkr was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the companys stock collapsed in  kkr partnered with fleetnorstar financial group in the  acquisition of the bank of new england from the us federal deposit insurance corporation in january  kkr would exchange its investment for a  interest in fleet bank kkr completed the  buyout of american re corporation from aetna as well as a  interest in tw corporation later known as the flagstar companies and owner of dennys in  among the other notable investments kkr completed in the early s included world color press – reltec corporation  and brunos

equity fund the kkr  fund however kkr was still burdened by the performance of the rjr investment and repeated obituaries in the media kkr was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund ie offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals kkr acquired regal cinemas in  only to see the company in bankruptcy by  kkrs activity level would accelerate over the second half of the s making a series of notable investments including spalding holdings corporation and evenflo  newsquest

takeover the deal with united artists fell apart destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company two years later in  regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection the company passed to billionaire investor philip anschutz –edit shoppers drug mart the canadian pharmacy was one of several successful buyouts in the

dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble although kkrs track record since rjr nabisco was mixed losses on such investments as regal entertainment group spalding flagstar and primedia previously kiii communications were offset by successes in willis group wise foods inc wincor nixdorf and mtu aero engines among others additionally kkr was one of the few firms that was able to complete large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the internet bubble including shoppers drug mart and bell canada yellow pages kkr was able to realize

corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs
