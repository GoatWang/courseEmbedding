lt schneider defendant represented by brandon t flugaur  wisconsin department of justice sgt umentum defendant represented by brandon t flugaur  wisconsin department of justice co ii beahm defendant represented by brandon t flugaur  wisconsin department of justice co ii gill defendant represented by brandon t flugaur  wisconsin department of justice order william e duffin magistrate judge plaintiff jeffrey scott who is representing himself filed a complaint pursuant to  usc § alleging that his civil rights were violated while he was incarcerated at waupun correctional institution waupun the court screened scotts complaint pursuant to  usc §aa and allowed him to proceed with his claims that the defendants violated the eighth amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they conducted a strip search without any penological justification on march   the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment that motion was fully briefed on april   on june   the court ordered the defendants to supplement their summary judgment materials to address specific questions posed by the court the defendants did so on july   although the court gave scott the opportunity to respond to the defendants additional materials he has not done so for the reasons explained below the court grants the defendants motion and dismisses this lawsuit i facts the facts are primarily taken from defendants reply to plaintiffs response to defendants proposed findings of fact ecf no  additional facts are taken from defendants supplemental proposed findings of fact ecf no  the facts are undisputed unless noted otherwise at all relevant times scott was confined at waupun ecf no  ¶ defendants joseph beahm and jeffrey gill are employed by the wisconsin department of corrections doc as correctional officers at waupun id at ¶ defendant jessie schneider is employed by the doc as a supervising officer  lieutenant at waupun id at ¶ and defendant gabriel umentum is employed by the doc as a correctional sergeant at waupun id at ¶ on november   beahm was conducting a standard wellness check ie count of lower brange where scott was housed id at ¶ during such checks staff members are required to view an inmates skin and movement id although prison procedures allow an inmate to rest or sleep with something over his eyes his mouth and the lower part of his face must be visible to security staff id when beahm arrived at scotts cell he was unable to see scotts skin because blankets were covering his entire body id at ¶ according to beahm he knocked numerous times on scotts door and yelled loudly at scott to make some type of movement but received no response id at ¶ beahm notified umentum who was able to get a response from scott about five minutes later id at ¶ beahm decided to write a conduct report and fill out a restriction form to place scott on a linen restriction based on scotts refusal to obey beahms orders to uncover and show movement ecf no  ¶  according to beahm inmates are placed on restrictions based on the items they misuse id because scott abused his linen by completely covering himself and thwarting beahms attempt to confirm his wellbeing beahn recommended that scotts use of linen be restricted ie he would be restricted to one blanket and one washcloth ecf no  ¶ ecf no  ¶ scott argues that beahm did not have authority to place him on such a restriction ecf no  ¶ this appears to be true however beahm explains that when a restriction form is submitted it goes into effect immediately while a security supervisor and the security director decide whether to approve it id if the security supervisor or the security director do not approve the recommended restriction the inmate is removed from the restriction id as a result of being placed on the linen restriction schneider and other staff went to scotts cell to retrieve his linen id scott refused numerous directives to hand his linen to jail staff id schneider states that because scott had been uncooperative several times that morning schneider decided to order a strip search to make sure that scott did not have any contraband id at ¶ ecf no  ¶ according to schneider if an inmate is uncooperative it is usually for a reason ecf no  ¶ thus when an inmate exhibits behavior indicating that he may be hiding contraband such as refusing to uncover himself or refusing to hand out his linen a supervisor will order that the inmate be strip searched ecf no  ¶ a cell extraction team was eventually assembled to remove scott from his cell however a correctional officer who is not named as a defendant was able to get scott to agree to come out of his cell voluntarily and go to the strip cell ecf no  at ¶ once at the strip cell scott refused to comply with a voluntary strip search so schneider directed gill to perform a staffassisted strip search id at ¶  generally a strip search is performed as follows correctional staff direct the inmate to remove all clothing and hand it over to the searching staff member id at ¶ once the inmate is naked the staff member visually inspects the inmates entire body including hair ears mouth nose hands armpits groin area between toes bottoms of feet inner portions of the legs and rectum id the staff member then inspects the inmates clothing and personal articles and returns them to the inmate id when an inmate displays noncompliant behavior immediately prior to a strip search staff conduct a staffassisted strip search id at ¶ in a staffasssited strip search the inmate is restrained and two officers maintain handson control of the inmate by holding on to his arms id a third staff member cuts off the inmates clothing and inspects the clothes for contraband id the staff member then visually inspects the inmates body id because the inmate is restrained the staff member conducting the search needs to physically touch the inmate with gloved hands id two bladed or straightened fingers are used to lift the inmates testicles and the backs of both bladed hands are used to separate the inmates buttocks id contact with the inmates testicles and buttocks is very brief lasting just a second id a staffassisted strip search has to be approved by a supervisor who must be present during the search id at ¶ according to scott all four defendants were present during the search id at ¶   gills search of scott yielded no contraband and scott was escorted back to his cell without further incident id at ¶  in december  scott wrote to the waupun health services department and alleged that he was sexually assaulted by a staff member during a strip search id at ¶ in the course of investigating scotts claim he was interviewed and described his interaction with gill q   was there any    a   he said he said he was like im fittin to use the back of my hands to spread your cheeks and he spread my cheeks then he went around to the front and he was like im fittin to use the back of my hands to lift your nuts and thats what he did q so he said he was going to use the back of his hands and did he use the back of his hands when he spread your cheeks a i dont know i cant see back there q did he use the back of his hand when he lifted your    a i wasnt look i wasnt looking down q okay did he grope your scrotum a you say grope like feel on me q yeah like    a naw i dont think so q okay and when he spread your buttocks did he grope your butt a like feel on    q like squeeze it grope q like hes copping a feel like hes    a naw i wouldnt    i dont know he just spread my buttocks q how long would you say the contact was would you say it was a second you know ten seconds how long did    a how long it takes to just grab the butt and spread the cheeks thats how long it was q what about the front a same thing q have you ever had a staff assisted strip search done before a no ive been    and this is my third incarceration and im  years in and that shit aint ever happened to me before    q when he when officer gill was performing the strip search did he say anything else to you at that point besides im going to use the back of my hand to spread your cheeks and    im going to use the back of my hand to lift your sack a naw q he didnt say anything else a naw id at ¶ ii summary judgment standard the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law fed r civ p a see also anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    celotex corp v catrett  us    ames v home depot usa inc  fd   th cir  material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the suit see anderson  us at  a dispute over a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party id a party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by a citing to particular parts of materials in the record including depositions documents electronically stored information affidavits or declarations stipulations including those made for purposes of the motion only admissions interrogatory answers or other materials or b showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact fed r civ p c an affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge set out facts that would be admissible in evidence and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated fed r civ p c iii analysis strip searches are not per se unconstitutional fillmore v page  fd   th cir  for scott to prevail on his claim that the strip search was unconstitutional he must show that the search was maliciously motivated unrelated to institutional security and hence totally without penological justification whitman v nesic  fd   th cir  internal quotations and citations omitted scott could also demonstrate that the defendants conducted the physical search of scott in a harassing manner intended to humiliate and inflict psychological pain cherry v frank  fedappx   th cir  citing calhoun v detalla  fd   th cir  bruscino v carlson  fd   th cir  scott argues that the strip search was not penologically motivated but was motivated by beahms desire to harass scott because he did not respond to him during the morning wellness check scott also argues that beahm lacked the authority to place him on a linen restriction and that no such restriction was warranted because umentum was able to get a response from scott a mere five minutes after beahm had failed to scott improperly conflates the decision to place him on a linen restriction and the decision to strip search him these were separate decisions made by different people for different reasons beahm recommended the linen restriction because scott had disobeyed his orders to remove his blankets beahm clarifies that while he does not have final authority to approve a restriction an inmate will be placed on a recommended restriction immediately pending approval if a security supervisor or the security director does not ultimately approve the restriction the inmate will be taken off the restriction here final approval was given the day after the incident and the security director ordered that the restriction would remain in effect until november   ten days after the incident occurred ecf no  ¶ in this lawsuit scott was allowed to proceed on a claim challenging the constitutionality of the strip search not on a claim challenging the constitutionality of the linen restriction schneider ordered the strip search not beahm he did so because scott had been uncooperative several times throughout the morning first when he failed to uncover himself and later when he refused to hand out his linen and exit his cell scott was not strip searched because he was placed on a linen restriction there is no policy requiring that inmates who are placed on a linen restriction automatically be strip searched ecf no  ¶ schneider ordered a strip search because in his experience scotts refusal to comply with orders indicated that he may be trying to hide contraband scott does not dispute that he failed to respond to orders to uncover himself nor does he dispute that he initially refused to hand out his linen or exit his cell instead he explains that he was asleep and eventually uncovered himself and eventually handed out his linen and exited his cell but as stated by the court of appeals for the seventh circuit orders given must be obeyed inmates cannot be permitted to decide which orders they will obey and when they will obey them    lewis v downey  fd   th cir  quoting soto v dickey  fd   th cir  while discipline in an institution no doubt is difficult  it is essential if the prison is to function and provide for the care safety and security of the staff and inmates    services to provide food clothing health medical cleaning laundry and all other services would come to an end without discipline mob rule would take over soto  fd at  the court in soto echoed the instructions of the us supreme court reminding courts that if prison officials are to be free to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of inmates and correctional personnel they must be accorded wideranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgement are needed to preserve internal order and discipline to maintain institutional security such considerations are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of correctional officers and without substantial evidence to indicate such officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations courts should defer to their judgment not only are such administrators in a better position to know and determine what action or remedies are needed and proper but the operation of our correctional systems and facilities is within the responsibility of the executive and legislative branches of government id at  citing bell v wolfish  us    other citations omitted scott has failed to set forth evidence supporting his contention that the strip search was ordered totally without penological justification see whitman  fd at  because schneider has explained the penological justification for his decision and because courts must defer to prison officials judgment on how best to preserve order and maintain institutional safety the court finds that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this aspect of scotts claim next the court must determine whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the search was conducted in a harassing manner intended to humiliate and inflict psychological pain on scott scott does not discuss this aspect of his claim in his summary judgment materials according to the defendants during the course of an investigation in  into his complaint that he had been sexually assaulted by gill scott described how the strip search was conducted scott explained that gill told him he was going to use the back of his hands to spread scotts buttocks and that he was going to use the back of his hand to lift scotts scrotum scott denied that gill groped him or squeezed him scott also denied that gill said anything to him other than to inform him of what he was about to do finally scott conceded that gill touched him only for the length of time necessary to spread his buttocks and lift his scrotum scotts earlier description of the search which scott does not now dispute confirms that gills conduct was consistent with doc policy for staffassisted searches the undisputed facts show that the strip search was not conducted in a harassing manner intended to humiliate and inflict psychological pain on scott and no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise as a result the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this aspect of scotts claim as well in short there is no question that strip searches may be unpleasant humiliating and embarrassing to prisoners but not every psychological discomfort a prisoner endures amounts to a constitutional violation calhoun v detalla  fd   th cir  although the search was clearly an unpleasant experience for scott there is no evidence suggesting that it was constitutionally unacceptable iv conclusion wherefore it is hereby ordered that the defendants motion for summary judgment ecf no  is granted the clerk of court will enter judgment accordingly this order and the judgment to follow are final a dissatisfied party may appeal this courts decision to the court of appeals for the seventh circuit by filing in this court a notice of appeal within  days of the entry of judgment see federal rules of appellate procedure  and  this court may extend this deadline if a party timely requests an extension and shows good cause or excusable neglect for not being able to meet the day deadline see federal rule of appellate procedure aa under certain circumstances a party may ask this court to alter or amend its judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e or ask for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b any motion under federal rule of civil procedure e must be filed within  days of the entry of judgment the court cannot extend this deadline see federal rule of civil procedure b any motion under federal rule of civil procedure b must be filed within a reasonable time generally no more than one year after the entry of the judgment the court cannot extend this deadline either see federal rule of civil procedure b a party is expected to closely review all applicable rules and determine what if any further action is appropriate footnotes  a video of the strip search exists however scott and the search are obscured by the cell door and the guards surrounding scott as such the video is
