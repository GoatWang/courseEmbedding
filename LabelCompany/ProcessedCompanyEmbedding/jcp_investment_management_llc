jcp investment management llc jcp josh schechter and brad radoff together with their affiliates jcp investment management group or we collectively a significant shareholder of cst brands inc cst or the company nyse cst today announced it has delivered a letter to the chief executive officer kim lubel and csts board of directors the full text of the letter follows december   kim lubel chief executive officer  cst brands inc one valero way building d suite  san antonio texas  cc members of the board of directors dear kim jcp investment management llc jcp josh schechter and brad radoff together with their affiliates we collectively own approximately  million of the outstanding shares of cst brands inc cst or the company  over the past several months members of our group have discussed with you various issues we believe have plagued csts operating and share price performance  as a follow up to our conversations we outline below for the benefit of the full cst board of directors the board and our fellow shareholders our views regarding the issues facing the company and the opportunities to create value at cst specifically we are concerned about the following issues which have persisted since the  spin off from valero energy corporation belowindustry average merchandise margins suboptimal returns on new store builds and related concerns about significant planned capex stagnant merchandise samestore sales relative to peers mismanagement of crossamerica including distribution coverage ratio that has declined to an unsustainable level slow growth and unclear food service strategy and staggered board without adequate shareholder representation all of the above factors have weighed on the share price causing cst to trade at a significant discount to its peer group and substantially below the strategic value of the franchise furthermore we are not alone in our frustration with the companys operational and share price performance  within the last two weeks another shareholder has publicly voiced concerns and a leading sellside research analyst appeared to agree with their analysis as you well know the convenience store industry is undergoing rapid consolidation  within the last eighteen months multiple transactions have taken place in the industry most of them at enterprise valueebitda multiples in excess of where cst currently trades  we understand this trend quite well since two of us were on the board of directors of the pantry inc  the pantry which was acquired by alimentation couchetard for approximately  billion and generated meaningful total shareholder return from the date we joined the board of the pantry     we have studied the  plan for cst similar to our analysis as board members at the pantry and have concluded that the risk of achieving the  vision and the upside to that vision should be compared to the immediate value that could be realized in a strategic sale cst is a highly attractive asset  the company has high market share in several texas markets and an attractive niche market in eastern canada  cst owns the vast majority of its real estate and has an attractive land bank  we strongly believe that there would be significant interest in cst from strategic buyers and the board should explore and consider the opportunities we have appreciated our open and constructive dialog with you to date and hope we can continue that discussion with you and the board best james pappas joshua schechter bradley radoff about jcp investment management jcp investment management llc is an investment firm

andineffective advertising programin fact the company is facing so many issues that mr stockinger apparently has a list of  action items that must be taken to address fiestas everworsening performance we appreciate a good list but what fiesta really needs is a sense of accountability – something that has been lacking in the boardroom for far too longfollowing mondays earnings call we believe stockholders now can fully appreciate the deferred maintenance needs referred to in the companys april th press release announcing certain preliminary financial results and the strategic renewal plan the fact that the board wasted more than  million investing in new markets while neglecting the core florida market and failing to maintain these once highly profitable stores demonstrates the need to hold the incumbent directors accountable who authorized this value destructionwe remind stockholders that not one nonexecutive director has stepped down from the board despite the companys continued underperformancea vote on the gold proxy for john b morlock and james c pappas means a vote forincreased management accountability we intend to establish stated ebitda goals and other performance metrics to make expectations clear and enhance accountability improved corporate governance we intend to seek stockholder approval to declassify the board and eliminate other stockholderunfriendly governance practices additional restaurant expertise on the board messrs morlock and pappas each bring a wealth of restaurant industry experience direct stockholder representation in the boardroom we
