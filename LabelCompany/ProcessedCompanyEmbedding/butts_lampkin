fiscal  conference call todays conference is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to mr joe sanderson please go ahead sir joe f sanderson jr thank you good morning and welcome to sanderson farms second quarter conference call we issued a news release this morning announcing net income of  million or  per share for our second fiscal quarter of  this compares to net income of  million or  per share during last years second quarter i will begin the call with some general observations but before i do i will ask mike to give the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements mike cockrell thank you joe and good morning everyone this mornings call will contain forwardlooking statements about the business financial condition and prospects of the company the actual performance of the company could differ materially from that indicated by our forwardlooking statements because of various risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties are described in our most recent annual report on form k and in the companys quarterly report on form q filed this morning with the sec in connection with our second quarter and in our press release published this morning these documents are available on our website at sandersonfarmscom if you need access to them you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements made this morning as these statements speaks only as of today we undertake no obligation to update or to revise our forwardlooking statements external factors affecting our business such as feed grain cost market prices for poultry meat and the health of the economy among others may be different tomorrow and our view today may be different from a few days from now joe f sanderson jr thank you mike benign grain cost continued strong demand for chicken at retail grocery stores higher volumes and improved export markets drove our results during our second fiscal quarter our sales volume in fresh and frozen chicken was up by  compared to last springs volume and reflects outstanding yields and new production in palestine and st pauls our feed cost per pound of fresh chicken processed was essentially flat during the quarter compared to last years second quarter while our average net sales price per pound of chicken sold was up by  market prices continued to reflect good demand for chicken in addition to strong demand at retail grocery stores market prices for chicken wings improved counter seasonally during the quarter boneless breast meat prices made a move up in april and have continued to move higher in may while export market headwinds remained including politics economic factors and the strength of the us dollar export demand continued to improve this spring the relative strength of the us dollar continues as a headwind politics still impact our relationship with china but we are hopeful that will change finally while oil prices remain relatively low they have moved above their bottom giving more buying power to countries heavily dependent on oil revenue to fuel their economy some export partners who typically look to the eu for chicken have increased purchases from the united states as a result of the presence of avian influenza in europe as a result of these improvements leg quarter market prices moved higher as we moved through the quarter and leg quarter inventories remained manageable these favorable trends should they continue should support prices over the short term prices paid for feed grains were higher during the quarter compared to last years second fiscal quarter but improved feed conversion rates and feed formulation adjustments allowed us to partially offset those higher prices in my view grain prices still dont reflect the ample worldwide supply of grain and as a result we remain close to the market planting progress in the united states remained slightly below historical averages but time remains to get seeds in the ground getting acres planted doesnt mean a lot for future grain prices and feed costs but it is a necessary first step in realizing a good crop that said we have priced little of our needs past next week and given where future prices closed yesterday on the chicago board of trade had we priced all of our needs through the end of fiscal year at yesterdays close cash corn and soybean meal prices during fiscal  would be  million higher than a year ago these numbers do not include the additional volume of grain we will need to purchase this year to feed the additional chickens we have on the ground in palestine and st pauls these higher costs would translate into a very slight increase in feed cost per pound of chicken processed for the year in addition to our cost we will be closely watching the chicken market and production numbers weekly exits over the past few weeks continue to trend a bit above a year ago and pullet placements continue to run slightly ahead of year ago numbers however hatch rates are lower it appears i might finally be right in my prediction that live weights are levelling off through march our industry processed  more ahead and live weights have been essentially flat with last year the current usda estimate for  more broiler meat during calendar  when compared to  seems reasonable but could prove to be higher should hatch rates and live weights continue to trend lower despite higher production per capita availability of chickens to domestic consumers is up less than  as a result of higher export volume im pleased to report that the startup of our new st pauls north carolina facility continues to go well and we expect to reach full production in st pauls during our first fiscal quarter of  the successful startup reflects the success in our training program which prepare young managers to run the new operation we continue to train managers to start operations at our next new facilities in tyler texas construction is scheduled to begin there in our third fiscal quarter and we plan to open the new facilities during our first fiscal quarter of  at this point ill turn the call over to lampkin for a more detailed discussion of the market and our operations during the quarter lampkin butts thank you joe and good morning everyone as joe mentioned overall market prices for poultry products were higher during the quarter when compared to our second quarter last year market prices for chicken products sold to retail grocery store customers remained relatively strong during the quarter and continued to reflect good demand bulk leg quarter prices were higher for the quarter compared to last years second quarter for reasons described by joe averaging  per pound during our second quarter this year compared to  per pound last year through march industry export volumes were up approximately  for calendar  compared to last year and export values were higher by  leg quarter prices improved during our second quarter by  compared to our first quarter the current unabated bulk leg quarter is  per pound prices for jumbo wings were higher during our second fiscal quarter than last years second quarter jumbo wings averaged  per pound up  from the average of  per pound during last years second quarter the current unabated quote for jumbo wings is  per pound boneless breast prices improved during april and have continued to move higher in may market prices were higher on average by  compared to the second quarter a year ago the second quarters average unabated price was  per pound today the unabated quoted market for jumbo boneless breast is  per pound the overall result of these market price changes was an increase of  per pound in our average sales price per pound of chickens sold we sold  billion pounds of poultry during the second quarter an increase from the  million pounds sold during last years second quarter we processed  billion pounds of breast poultry during the quarter up  from the  million pounds we processed during last years second quarter we previously projected we would process  billion pounds during the quarter and higher than projected yields and  million pounds processed on house of raeford birds offset by slightly lower live weights than originally projected made up the difference from our projection we now expect to process approximately  billion pounds of fresh chicken this fiscal year an increase of approximately  compared to fiscal  we estimate we will process approximately  billion pounds in our third fiscal quarter and approximately  billion pounds during our fourth quarter we have factored into these estimates a lower target live weight the improved yields in live bird performance we have experienced the past two quarters as well as the birds we will process for house of raeford both of these estimates could be impacted by weather bird performance and other factors some of which are beyond our control results and margins at our prepared food plant improved during the second quarter compared to the second quarter last year and we expect further improvement during the second half of the year we sold  million pounds of processed chicken at our prepared chicken plant during the first half of this year compared to  million pounds through the first half of last year the average sales price through the first half of the year decreased  per pound compared to last year both live production and our processing plants have performed very well versus the industry peers during the first half of the year we certainly have opportunities that we are anxious to capture but ive been pleased with our operations at this point ill turn the call over to mike mike cockrell thank you lampkin the  increase in net sales for the quarter to  million from  million last year was the result of the increase in sales price per pound described by lampkin and the increase in pounds of poultry products sold described by joe the increase in our cost of sales for the quarter ended april  as compared to the same three months last year was a result of an increase in pounds of poultry products sold of  million pounds or  partially offset by the  decrease in prepared chicken sold the  million increase in sga expenses for the first half of the year reflects increased accruals for advertising and marketing expenses higher trainee cost higher legal fees attributable to litigation and start up cost of st pauls during the first fiscal quarter ended january  of this year the company determined that achievement of the applicable performance space criteria for the performance shares granted november   was probable accordingly the quarter and year to date numbers both reflect compensation expense of  million and  million respectively related to those agreements as we move through the third quarter management will continue to evaluate the probability of an esop accrual and a bonus accrual the probability of reaching  per share which is the threshold target under the earnings per share bonus award program is difficult to assess with only two quarters under our belt but it will become clearer as we move through the summer recall that if we accrue a probable esop contribution that amount will be approximately  to  of gross profit and will be required to accrue three quarters of any expected liability in our third quarter for the third and fourth quarters i have  million and  million respectively in my model for sga these numbers reflect startup cost at tyler with advertising trainee cost legal fees and stock compensation expense remaining fairly steady with the first two quarters these numbers reflect no esop and no bonus accrual based solely on what we know today a  million accrual for the esop might be reasonable in the third quarter but again its too early to determine whether o not a bonus accrual is probable but to put some numbers around a potential bonus accrual while we determined that hitting the threshold earnings per share target under our bonus award program was probable thats  a share it would cost right at  million if we hit the top target of  per share that would cost  million the midpoint of  would be a  million accrual the companys effective tax rate for the quarter and the first six months ended april   was  and for the balance of the year we continue to model that same  we now expect to spend approximately  million on capex during the fiscal  and have spent  million through the first half of the year of this total  million was in st pauls we intend to use cash on hand and cash flows to fund the balance of our capital budgets our depreciation and amortization for the first half of the year was  million and we now expect approximately  million for the full year before opening the call for questions i want to mention that we will host our annual investor conference in new orleans again this fall the conference will open with dinner thursday night at the same venue as always and the conference will start at  oclock friday morning october th the conference will be at the monteleone this year and dinner on thursday night at i said would be in the same spot we hope many of you will join us in new orleans for the conference and we will send information out and post it to our website very soon but for now please mark the date katie thats our prepared remarks if you want to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from farha aslam farha please go ahead farha aslam congratulations on the very strong quarter question about bird weight and production and clearly profitability in the industry is very strong indiscernible were being held up by the bird weight issue and the performance of the current breed could you share with us how long you anticipate that issue to continue and kind of as you go forward longerterm how do you think the industry will respond to the very good profit level joe f sanderson jr we have anecdotal data about bird weight mainly from urner barry urner barry is writing and talking about lower bird weights we have seen flat bird weight from usda for januaryfebruarymarch they are flat and urner barry is talking about lighter bird weights and he has more access to processors than we do and we know we have brought our bird weights in our big bird plants down from  to  to try to address woody breast we think the industry or some in the industry has done the same thing and we can see in agro stats there are no more  pound birds and thats how we can see it and it looks like the average weight in the deboning market segment is down some and thats all we know right now we also can look at usda statistics and see that the average hatchability is down  from a year ago you can see the exits running about  ahead of a year ago but the chick placements are  ahead of a year ago so it looks like the flock is older and its not hatching as well my expectations would be to address that issue is for pullet placements at some point to go up a little bit to address that issue but not a lot because i think the industry is pretty close to processing capacity so thats what i think farha aslam thats helpful lampkin butts this is lampkin we have seen some usda numbers that show that number of hen being processed  pounds and up is down  and then the  to  are up  so we do know that that many hen have shifted down into that less than  pound weight joe f sanderson jr and we think that thats woody breast farha aslam okay so thats the breast issue okay and then if we think about china there is talk about a chinese delegation coming to us kind of midyear to look at plants et cetera in terms of the timing of china opening up to indiscernible poultry and what that would do to sandersons earnings lampkin butts its our understanding that china has a delegation coming in june primarily to discuss and look at regionalization of the united states for something like avian influenza i think theyve got to come in june and come back in september but that ai ban was implemented in january of  and we have not been optimistic until now that that might be lifted i dont know when but f we are successful it will probably be this fall but first time we have been optimistic since january  when we lost that market it was pretty indiscernible it was costing us  million a year the markets that we see that we are missing out on are still right at  million a month farha aslam so  million a month if china opens up joe f sanderson jr its about  million a month now when you add at our new production in pretax farha aslam im sorry so it was  million before and then if we add your new production that we add another  million joe f sanderson jr no no the market is different today than it was then we dont know what the market is going to be when the market opens back up the market today reflects going through hong kong and so we dont know we have no idea of what the market is going to be like if china opens when we dont know about a tariff so we dont know it could be – it was  million but we had new production additional production and we can say what it was when we left lampkin butts what we see is just a net dock we have no idea of the expense that the industry… joe f sanderson jr we are not going through indiscernible we are not doing that right now lampkin butts i think thats a very conservative number farha aslam okay so  million a month would be a conservative number or roughly  million joe f sanderson jr yes farha aslam okay thats very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from ken goldman of jp morgan please go ahead ken goldman two for me if i can just if you could get a little bit of an update or if we can get a little bit of an update on your latest thoughts on tray pack pricing what your customer are basing it on are you still basing it off the last georgia dock price im not sure if you had addressed that previously how accurate do you think the new urner barry price is just a little more color there would be i think helpful joe f sanderson jr most of our customers are still offered the last published georgia dock which is  now thats their base price and then a lot of them have sale prices that are agreedupon whenever their contract will sign some of them have sale prices that are based off the urner barry prices that are as you know going up every day now and then some of them have negotiated sale prices as we said i believe – when did we describe was it december or february when we described how much of our product is based off the georgia dock lampkin butts that was in february joe f sanderson jr february about  of our sales are actually based off georgia dock lampkin butts about half of our traypack joe f sanderson jr a half of our traypack in terms of our sales are based off the georgia dock in addition to that we have gone out to our customers in the last month and asked for a raise because if there were a georgia dock it would be going up right now and everybody knows it and we have been successful in some places in some places they said we are going to stick by our contract and use the georgia dock the last one that was published but we have gotten some increases for the summertime from some of our accounts we believe that we and our customers are going to have to look at the new urner barry for a while before everybody is comfortable with it we ask urner barry to do this to publish these numbers but we think it will be the first of next year probably before everybody has seen it enough it looks pretty good to me but we think it will be next year before everybodys seen enough of it to become comfortable with it ken goldman okay that is very helpful thank you for that and then my quick followup is wholesale beef prices have risen i know you dont sell any beef obviously but you certainly track your competitive products youre talking about chicken prices maybe not across the board going up on the tray pack side and the wholesale side but certainly in that direction what are you seeing in terms of your customers reactions because we are hearing certain comments out there ill leave it at that that maybe retailers are pushing back harder than usual not passing through as much pricing maybe pushing back like i said on their vendors how would you describe the retail environment in terms of both accepting price increases and then passing them on to consumers at least in the narrow area that you guys track lampkin butts ken we are not having any unusual pushback of course our customers that are on the georgia dock have been indiscernible with that part of their program as flat but no unusual pushback the only thing im aware of is that the retailers they have not passed along cheaper prices on particularly beef and pork chicken prices are down a little bit but they have mainly held on to their beef and pork margins other than some future prices joe f sanderson jr and ken what you have for memorial day you know indiscernible lampkin butts memorial day is going to be about like normal i mean theyve got some beef some chicken joe f sanderson jr we think beef got most of the ads but our orders for memorial day are so good that we are running two shifts on memorial day we normally run one shift the saturday before and then we are down memorial day but we had to crank everything up to fill orders this year ken goldman i hope those people working on memorial day are getting overtime thank you guys joe f sanderson jr they are operator our next question comes from ken zaslow of the bank of montreal please go ahead kenneth zaslow just a quick question can you talk about the different product weight and the margin associated with big birds versus small birds and just how everything has gone between tray packs and how you kind of see that developing over the next call it  to  months joe f sanderson jr margins on big birds got ahead of tray pack beginning in march and they are way ahead of them in may and we think thats going to last through labor day through september at least they are way ahead of them in may and for us i mean margins are still good on tray pack but they are exceptional right now in big birds lampkin butts thats margin per head ken joe f sanderson jr yes per head when you put – where is boneless lampkin butts  joe f sanderson jr  and  wing and a  leg quarter put that all together and – where are tenders lampkin butts  joe f sanderson jr and  on tenders and benign grain cost thats exceptional for big bird and we think prices are maybe going up a little bit more on bonus and tenders we think wings are kind of towards the top right now leg quarters may go up another  or so but we are in at least through memorial day in the first of month we are kind of getting close to the top on these prices for a while until heat hits and when the heat hits when you might see some other move but wings are pretty close to topping out kenneth zaslow can you tell me about what drove the wing prices so high and although you think they are topping out do you think they are stable at these current levels or you think they are going to start retreating seasonally and ill leave it there joe f sanderson jr ken its been a surprise to us i mean we are – historically wing prices start trending down after march madness so this has been a surprise we think it has to do with lighter bird weights and also the number of new restaurants that have been built over the last two years that are based off wing menus we think the supply and demand and i still think there will be a softening this summer i still think well see a dip sometime this summer but i dont think we are there yet operator our next question comes from mike piken from cleveland research please go ahead michael piken just want to talk a little bit more about the age of the flock and specifically your breeding flock and do you guys have plans to sort of replace some of your old pullets and when do you think the rest of the industry is going to be looking to do that to improve hatchability rates and how much of a indiscernible potential is there joe f sanderson jr our breed of flock is current we dont – our hatchability is normal and we dont have any older breeders and ours is like it always has been but i dont know – we started getting calls for eggs right after the first year and from two or three other integrators and the indication was there were some health problems with their breeders and they wanted to buy eggs from us which we dont sell eggs we dont have enough eggs to sell normally and i dont know what kind of health problems they were having but as we moved forward you can look at the hatchability and the chick placements entailed that this flock is older and they are not hatching well last year the hatch was  all year and i have no clue whats going on there but there is some health issue or something with the overall flock but nothing with ours michael piken okay do you know if its impacting a certain size bird more than the others like is that part of the reason maybe big bid profitability has improved a little bit more joe f sanderson jr no i do not i have no clue if its one breed or not i dont have an answer to that michael piken okay and then shifting gears if you could just talk a little bit about your volume expectations for  with or without raeford specifically how that might impact your  joe f sanderson jr st pauls will be at capacity beginning in january so raeford birds wont have any impact in  but st pauls will be at full capacity so do you all have  lampkin butts processing growth chart well have in just a minute joe f sanderson jr they are getting it for you mike michael piken okay thanks whenever thats fine you could pass it on thanks operator in the meantime our next question comes from adam samuelson from goldman sachs please go ahead adam samuelson maybe first i was wondering if you could quantify the profit impact if any from house of raeford in the quarter and then for the pounds that youre processing for the balance of the year should we be considering those just you have marketing control of that product and so your margin should be consistent with the other tons ph that are flowing through st pauls or are there any other… lampkin butts we are paying house of raeford a flat fee per live pound as we described in the q this morning and thats really about all we can say about that contract now we take the market risk on the birds the birds are ours and we sell them they take the market risk on grain we are paying a flat fee per live pound the margins just like they are on our other big bird products are good right now adam samuelson thats helpful and then maybe just on the market im wondering joe if you have any thoughts or youre seeing any impact in the industry data of higher antibiotic free and no human antibiotic production on the industry whether thats on the hatch if people arent using the antibiotics on the hatchery anymore if you think thats part of the cause of some of the people moving down in bird class size just any thoughts of how that might be impacting available supplies maybe certainly the egg production and availability in the industry has stepped up even if youre not producing yourself joe f sanderson jr i think that may affect livability on flocks sold more than it would on hatchability i mean we know that the total livability on no antibiotic birds is lower than if you use antibiotics about  to  at least and in some cases  and so i think there are fewer head delivered to the plant for sure with no antibiotics and i think possibly at times you might have lower bird weights but they can compensate for that by keeping birds in the houses longer but mainly it probably affects feed conversion more than it does live weight i think it could affect live weight to some degree adam samuelson okay thats helpful ill pass it on operator our next question comes from heather jones from the vertical group please go ahead heather jones so circling back to the retail business could you give us a sense of what kind of price increases youve gotten just for modeling purposes i understand that it sounds like you wont transition most of your business to a new price index until calendar  but i mean did you get enough increases for the summer to make it meaningful like do we need to get worried about that for our models joe f sanderson jr you know how many lampkin butts halfhalf of our customers we have been to half and half of those were good and were waiting to hear from the other half as our target modify heres the thing a portion of that business is sold at future prices indiscernible future prices are moving up if they are being negotiated these markets are higher so theyll negotiate at a higher price or at this time indiscernible quote those are higher so retail revenue is going to be up i cant say how much but it is going – its not going to be flat because of the indiscernible heather jones and you are talking about its going to be up sequentially but it would sound like its going to be up yearonyear as well could you have the pieces tied to the features like you said indiscernible strong joe f sanderson jr yes thats right heather jones okay i mean because honestly if you look at some of these urner barry quotes i mean am i out in la la land to think that the piece that you have been able to get redone could be up more than  year on year joe f sanderson jr no heather jones im not in la la land joe f sanderson jr yes it wont be up  heather jones it wont be up that piece wont be up that much joe f sanderson jr no heather jones okay moving on to the weights and also clearly woody breast is the biggest driver so i have a twopart question i understand that there are more foodservice companies that are going to be not only trying to get weights off the larger birds but actually potentially moving into other weight classes like the much smaller birds so one how early do you think we are in this trend and then secondly a number of customers both on the retail and the foodservice side have committed to adopting gaap ph standards which call for slower growth indiscernible and lower density so i guess i hesitate to say this given the nature of this industry but if we can look out two or three years it seems like theres a number of factors that are going to be a governor on supply and just if you could help us think about that joe f sanderson jr i think there is another governor on supply and that is – if you want to look at what our next complex is going to cost its going to cost  million to  million and none of the big companies that could do that have indicated no intention of doing that and i think that is a governor owned supply there is a possibility that usda could change line speeds the regulation that governs line speeds right now there is indiscernible line speeds of  birds a minutes we run  birds a minute but everybody else runs  except a few plants that run  and a few plants that run the original plants that tested the himp system at  they were grandfathered in at  i dont know how many plants that is six or seven and when the usda was proposing the himp process those consumer groups and the inspectors unions objected to it so usda pulled it capped it at  there is possibility that usda could go back in and reintroduce the  if that were to happen and it were to be passed i think you could see some expansion industry expansion by people going from  to  that would take a year to do that they have to order breeder stock they have to build chicken houses they have to make some modifications in hatcheries and processing plants and you know a year ahead of time i think it would be minor but i think thats where your expansion would come from i dont think anybody much is going to build a plant and i think the wait is over for a while the primary breeders are going to have to breed this woody breast out and thats going to take away a low feed conversion and maybe some yield to get this woody breast out and the other things you mentioned if that happens the slower growing broiler and the smaller bird and the woody breast are all we cant grow a  pound chicken right now which was our target for this year and the year before that we grew  pound chicken we cant do that heather jones so as a follow up on your weights comment do you think the reductions were seeing now are the extent of the reductions we are going to see or do you think there is going to be more widespread adoption across the industry that could lead to pressure on weight for call it another year joe f sanderson jr i dont know wendys required all of their suppliers to go to a  pound chicken that was the reason you saw that shift in class that lampkin was describing out of the  to the smaller class that usda is showing you might see some more of that we didnt supply wendys but we dropped our weights because of our customers we did that on our own we just couldnt tolerate a product quality problem with our customers we did that before they – i mean we just our own qc test told us we need to do we did some other things too we changed our batch and we changed our lighting problem to try to get this product quality thing straightened out lampkin butts and heather ill take this opportunity to answer adams question i think it was adam  billion pounds in  thats up about  from this year sorry michael heather jones and the himp thing you said a possibility the way you said that makes me think that there are discussions ongoing right now as to that i mean when could we see some color as to when they are going to allow that joe f sanderson jr it will have to be published in the federal register and then – we dont i dont think its imminent heather jones you dont think its imminent its not being discussed right now joe f sanderson jr no heather jones okay perfect thank you operator our next question comes from francesco pellegrino from sidoti  company please go ahead francesco pellegrino i want to ask you a question about just what are your thoughts on maybe the longterm feasibility of the marketing program given what you have learned so far during  something that we think about continuing in fiscal  as well joe f sanderson jr our marketing program advertising we keep doing it became we will keep doing it francesco pellegrino at an  million run rate per quarter joe f sanderson jr i think thats reasonable for now frankly we have talked about second half of the year but we really havent started planning any strategy for next year but i think thats reasonable to build a model on francesco pellegrino okay just when i start thinking about how you guys are earning your bonus accrual if you are going to pay out the  million to the esop plan one of the questions that i had was sort of about like where your stepup function is going for your depreciation expense i guess over the past three years on a quarterly basis it looks like depreciation has increased by  million and thats per quarter and i know weve had a lot of elevated spending over the past three or four years to support the business during some really great times and given how strong your balance sheet has been but just given how quickly depreciation has sort of stepped up given where your capex guidance is this year thinking about construction beginning in tyler texas over this summer and then wherever your maintenance capex is right now for the business where should depreciation be sort of topping out at joe f sanderson jr we keep building plants so its not going to top out mike cockrell our maintenance budget has increased weve got about  million now and we are stepping that up  million a year just because we are adding assets so in my model you got a  then    just add  million to it because we keep adding plants so depreciation of course is just a function of building these  million plants like joe described francesco pellegrino right but we are also lapping at period of time whether its    years ago where we didnt have this elevated capex spending so we really dont have new highpriced assets coming off the books so if we sort of just think about tyler texas maybe being – and i know thats not it like its quarterly depreciation topping out at  million right now beginning in fiscal  mike cockrell actually im sorry im not sure im following exactly what youre asking ask that again francesco pellegrino so just when i look at all the assets that we are bringing online including tyler texas is it reasonable to think that maybe quarterly depreciation to be anywhere between  million to  million beginning in  mike cockrell yes francesco pellegrino okay all right thats it for me thank you guys operator our next question comes from akshay jagdale of jefferies please go ahead akshay jagdale congratulations on a solid quarter i wanted to ask about the breeder flock with pullet placements having sort of decelerated on a  month trailing basis so pullet placement growth was  or  last couple of years now its   or  depending on how you look at it but the breeder flock has actually since october of last year its up about  sequentially right and so what do you make of that is the last number that came up earlier this week says its up  yearoveryear i mean i guess the only answer the logical answer is the age of the flock has been brought down that your hen slaughter is down but what do you make of the breeder flock moving up as much as it has sequentially during a period when pullet placement growth has decelerated quite a bit joe f sanderson jr i think a lot of the pullet placements in  and  was mainly building up for pullets and hens for the export of eggs to mexico and i think everybody thought they were going into the domestic supply flock when most of that growth was for two reasons one of it there was a change going on in the breeds where aviagen was replacing two other breeds domestic flock and people were putting some extra breeders out because they didnt know what to expect from the aviagen hen as she was replaced and then the other extra in  and  two of the primary mexican suppliers integrators were putting their breeders in the united states and they were showing up in the domestic supply flock but they were really for eggs for mexico and so there really werent – it looked like they were for the domestic supply flock but they really were not they were for eggs for export and all of that big buildup in  and   to  of the breeder flock was for export eggs for export and i think that threw everybody off the real domestic supply flock for pullets for the us is about  and as far as meat broiler meat for this year when you subtract the exports out its right at  when you put it all together and pullets i dont think you look at one number one month the last month they came out which was   i dont think you look at that i dont think that means anything i think the next months maybe  and that  could be revised just one month doesnt mean anything akshay jagdale i realize i was talking more on a trailing  month average basis thats how we always look at pullet placements and pullet placements have decelerated but my question was more about i get the whole mexico issue we are now tracking egg exports to mexico which are down but the breeder flock itself which includes both mexico and us breeders right we dont know exactly what percentage is for mexico was down year over year so leaving aside what were exporting in terms of eggs the actual calculated or the reported number was down yearoveryear for most of the back half of  and now its back up during a period when your additions of pullets has decelerated right so thats what im asking about and at your analyst day there was one presentation where they talked about the age of the flock and it was projected that  was going to be  was the lowest in the last three four years and  was going to be slightly lower so it just seems to me that the age of the flock is now at a more optimal level and to get there you have changed the rate of mature hen slaughter if i may so thats what im getting at but i dont know if you look at it that way joe f sanderson jr we think the flock is older now we dont think its optimal we think it is older and the reason we do is because we look at the hatchability and the hatches at  we think they are holding pullets holding hens longer because they are not getting eggs out now we dont know that for a fact thats what we think but we are showing all of  the hen flock being  of  this year its about  so far for five months akshay jagdale so you dont agree with the emi projection for the age of the flock i guess you now think its a flocks age is actually up joe f sanderson jr i do akshay jagdale okay and then just while we are on talking about exports i mean i think hatching exports sort of peaked and showing yearoveryear decline a little bit any thoughts on whats happening there or do you have any sense of where thats headed joe f sanderson jr we have no clue i dont have a clue about whats going on in mexico its primarily actually the rest of the world i have a chart here in front of me the rest of the world is down a little bit from its peak canada is about flat but maybe up indiscernible and mexico is down just a little bit mexico is down from its peak by maybe  and of the total breeders and it was accounting for – the whole world was running  is down to  of total breeders but i dont have a clue whats going on in mexico or the rest of the world akshay jagdale okay and then one for mike and this is more of a longerterm question you had a pretty detailed explanation of esop and all that stuff which im sure im going to have to reread but that was helpful but if you just look longterm your sga to sales has gone up and thats a function of how well youre doing as a company so thats great but for somebody who is trying to model that portion of your pl over a three to five year period what do you think is a good number to use i mean it seems like you were at  for a long period of time and now the last five years or so its more like  with the increase in marketing the increase in esop and all that stuff so can you just help me out there like if you were to model for your company over a three to fiveyear period sga to sales whats the best guess over there joe f sanderson jr you are at peak right now mike cockrell yes i think thats hard akshay ex bonus and esop just take those out because i dont have a clue its hard quarter to quarter much less yeartoyear to know whether we are going to pay a bonus but our legal fees are up thats going to continue our trainee cost should be steady startup cost is going to move higher next year as we get st pauls we are going to do another plant after that then youre going to have startup cost the next year advertising im holding steady but again as we mentioned to another questioner that strategy may change but yes i think joe is right this is peak right now i feel like because we have got… joe f sanderson jr as you get more volume though its going to decline what im saying is youre at peak dollars as you get more volume that percentage goes down akshay jagdale whats the percent do you have a sense of percent thats nonesop bonus related because i know a part of the esop bonus also accrues… joe f sanderson jr not in there right now mike cockrell right the bonus and esop are not in there and when you go back and reread the script ive put those numbers out but no i dont have a percentage in front of me i dont know what sales are going to be next quarter akshay akshay jagdale got it okay ill pass it on thank you operator our next question comes from brett andress of keybanc capital markets please go ahead brett andress thanks for squeezing me in here i just had one quick question your other cost per pound they increased i think by about  or  im sorry per pound and you called out that about half of that was related to st pauls i believe im just trying to figure out whats your other half of that increase and i guess maybe was it related to maybe some of the overtime you ran during the quarter and how should we think about all the other cost that how that should trend through the back half of the year mike cockrell there were a couple of things going there was some overtime premium in that number salaries went up direct and indirect salaries both packaging was a little bit it was there is nothing one thing i can call out as most of it brett but it was salaries overtime supplies a little bit from repairs but it was spread out among those brett andress should we expect the st pauls the impact of that to maybe be diminished as we work through the next two quarters mike cockrell absolutely brett andress okay thats all i had thank you operator our final question comes from benjamin serra ph from barclays please go ahead unidentified analyst just i have two questions one could you just quickly confirm the capex number because i think i didnt get that for this year so just to see what to put into model i think i heard  but just to confirm mike cockrell that is correct unidentified analyst okay so we got that one and then second i mean youve mentioned prices are likely to come down on wings into the second half so with that in mind would you expect that the very strong levels of profitability you have seen in the first half i mean especially on an operating profit margin level that this is going to ease a little bit towards the end of the year but still turn out to be fairly strong and also thank you very much for the good guidance on absolute sga expenses for the year that helps a lot but just to get a little bit of a sense as what you are expecting in terms of pricing and cogs how thats going to evolve and how thats going to impact your margins because indiscernible sensitivity here mike cockrell i think wings will soften sometime this summer and then i think they will be going back up for football season joe f sanderson jr yes theyre going to have like  days its not going to be – i dont think – its hard as they will hold steady for a while mike cockrell i dont think its going down next week but sometime this summer joe f sanderson jr  is a lofty place for wings to be but if they come down its not going to be for long and for much i dont think they will come down a lot and i dont think they will come down alone so you got two things going to happen normally by this time we are already packing wings and putting them in the freezer for the football season mainly for januaryfebruary we hadnt put a single wing in the freezer so that has to be done and thats going to keep supply off the market and i think that a lot of these restaurants out there they are going full till and so i dont think it will be hot like it is right now or like it has been and then the other thing is i think breast and tenders and leg quarters they may slow down but they are not going to soften mike cockrell so those markets are very firm right now spot loads are trading at urner barry for boneless breast and real close to that tender so those markets are very firm going into the summertime joe f sanderson jr and so we think i dont see those markets coming down much i think there will be a cooling off period after the first of the month but on the heels of that is july th so we think the markets are going to be pretty good for a while unidentified analyst okay perfect thank you very much for that operator i am showing we have no further questions at this time joe f sanderson jr good thank you and thank all of you for spending time with us this morning we look forward to reporting our third quarter results in august
