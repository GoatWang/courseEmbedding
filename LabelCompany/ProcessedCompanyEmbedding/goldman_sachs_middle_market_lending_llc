five or six vps to its lending group and its bankers have been instructed to double their efforts to finance deals of less than  million according to a banker in touch with goldman executives calls to steve hickey head of bank loan sales and trading at the firm were not returned by press time last friday afternoon middle market lending has become an increasingly popular business it is on the agenda of bennett goodman new chief of credit suisse first bostons  billion alternative investments division cfw  it is also attracting institutional money managers such as goldentree asset management and friedberg milstein cfw   and several private equity firms have announced their intention to follow the lead of apollo management in launching business development companiespublicly traded funds that lend to the middle market despite the competition goldman executives still believe the middle market has some big advantages over blockbuster deals said the banker if the firm underwrites a  million term loan on its own it can earn a  million fee on a  million deal goldmans fees get squeezed to  or  million and if there are three underwriters on the deal goldmans share of that  million becomes  million league table credit is similarly watered down on large coled deals big ticket deals are also timeconsuming as they typically involve numerous fourway conference calls so that all the underwriters can be involved goldman was sole underwriter on a recent  million facility for vutek a maker of digital printers it was also all alone on a  million deal for frozen food maker luiginos in march and a  million loan in march for baker tanks in january get started subscribe show me all of my options     institutional investor llc all material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws
