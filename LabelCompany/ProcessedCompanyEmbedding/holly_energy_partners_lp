include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability tankage and pipeline integrity and safety and to address environmental regulations      as a master limited partnership we distribute our available cash which historically has exceeded our net income attributable to holly energy partners because depreciation and amortization expense represents a noncash charge against income the result is a decline in partners equity since our regular quarterly distributions have exceeded our quarterly net income attributable to holly energy partners additionally if the assets contributed and acquired from hollyfrontier while we were a consolidated variable interest entity of hollyfrontier had been acquired from third parties our acquisition cost in excess of hollyfrontiers basis in the transferred assets would have been recorded as increases to our properties and equipment and intangible assets at the time of acquisition instead of decreases to partners equity view source version on
