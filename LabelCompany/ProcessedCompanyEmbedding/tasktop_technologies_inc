company in bc countless hours are wasted at work due to inefficient communication between departments mik kersten ceo and cofounder of vancouverbased tasktop technologies inc has set out to solve this very human problem at least for software developers kersten and his team created a tool to help companies with large software development divisions track their time and tasks more effectively from the creation phase all the way to testing and delivery typically developers use what’s known in the industry as application lifecycle management or alm tools to help developers testers and other staff organize and coordinate their work larger companies might use a number of such systems boeing for example might use one from microsoft and another from hp these systems don’t always communicate with each another leaving teams out of sync with constantly evolving requirements lost in the translation from idea to a final software product tasktop created software that allows management systems for software developers to integrate and communicate more efficiently they’re the first company to connect disparate softwaredevelopment systems up to  at a time and the first to market in this area according to rizwan kheraj the industrial technology adviser for the national research council’s irap program at sfu who has worked with tasktop since its inception “you can think of them as the switzerland of alm systems” kheraj says “they’re sort of the arms dealer that deals with multiple conflicts” since its launch in  tasktop has continually expanded its efforts to quell conflicts in the software world an earlier version of its software called mylyn released for free as open source is downloaded two million times a month tasktop counts such global  corporations as ibm and microsoft among its clients and has doubled staff and revenue in the past  months  top  innovators next innovator  share tweet share share pin more stay informed with bcbusiness daily updates on whats happening

architectalmbig dataclouddevopsenterprisejavamobileopen sourcesecurityweb devwaters works news new tasktop tool scales agile devops integrations by david ramel tasktop technologies inc combined several of its software development and delivery products into a new suite that it says takes a different approach to integrating enterprise agile and devops initiatives announced yesterday the tasktop integration hub is designed to harness all of an organizations development and delivery tools workflows and integrations into one tool that can scale as needed this scaling capability is especially important as methodologies such as agile and devops have transformed enterprise software development the company said one aspect of that transformation is the shift from single inclusive platforms to disaggregated bestofbreed tools from multiple sources while integrating just a few disparate tools is relatively simple the interrelationships and integration problems become much more complex as the number of tools increases which tasktop said is a recent industry trend in prior decades the way to succeed with new methodologies involved betting on the right platform said tasktop ceo mik kersten in a blog post yesterday but in the world of agile and devops there is no one platform instead we are witnessing a largescale disaggregation of the tool chain towards the bestofbreed solutions for largescale agile and devops transformations to succeed we must shift our thinking from endtoend platform to tool chain modularity click on image for larger view integration hub overview source tasktop to that end the new integration hub combines tools that were previously offered independently including tasktop sync an integration server data a data repository for near realtime analytics and gateway an integration tool for connecting devops tools to the software lifecycle the integration hub introduces the concept of modelbased integration that helps disparate tools work together something that becomes more problematic as the number of tools increases tasktop used the metaphor of language translation to illustrate this concept whereas translating a document from spanish to french and vice versa is relatively easy translating a bunch of languages into all of the other languages is much more difficult in the modelbased approach this becomes easier as a language is first translated into a model  a kind of universal language like english for example  and then that single model is translated into all the other languages for example user stories defects and support ticket models are defined in tasktop and then can be easily mapped across dozens of different projects and tools kersten said click on image for larger view integration hub in action source tasktop tasktop said its approach enables organizations to grow their software deployments to the scale of hundreds of projects tens of thousands of users and millions of artifacts  such as tasks defects and requirements  without the need to write any code in addition to the modelbased integration other features of the new offering highlighted by the company include support for applying different styles of integration across tools for example agile and itsm tools can be integrated for defectticket unification then easily connected to a database for instant mean time to resolution mttr metrics easy scaling across hundreds of projects by defining models that span projects and tools new projects can be onboarded easily and connected to the value stream all integrations work all of the time via tasktops integration factory multiple versions of the same tool can be connected along with old versions of legacy tools and the frequently updated apis of softwareasaservice saas tools without breaking because tasktop tests all version combinations currently tasktop supports  tools and  versions tasktop said its integration hub which has been under development for three years and available as a limited release for about  months is now generally available as organizations transform into digital businesses the agile and devops movements powering those transformations start to fail once they are deployed to hundreds and thousands of it staff the company said in a statement yesterday the bestofbreed tools that make startups successful were not designed to work together at this scale resulting in duplicate entry a lack of visibility cost overruns and compliance exposure pointtopoint integrations enterprise services buses and inhouse approaches cannot solve the problem as they become prohibitively expensive to maintain due to the countless tools and versions that make up the modern tool chain tasktop serves as a value stream integration platform the first of its kind providing organizations with an enterprisegrade backbone that flows information in real time across all of the people processes and tools involved in software delivery about the author david
