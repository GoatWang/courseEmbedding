or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

expertise and hard work of mike humphries and the convertible team has been recognised by eurohedge as part of their highlyregarded awards to have won this award for a fourth time since  is testament

adequacy standards and an associated supervisory framework in the eu based on the basel ii rules it affects banks building societies as well as certain investment firms the directive was introduced into the uk by the financial services authority the new framework consisted of three pillars pillar  the minimum capital required by a firm to meet credit market and operational risk pillar  a regular assessment of a firms regulatory capital through a process known as the internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap which determines whether the amount of internal capital is sufficient to cover all the risks to which the firm is exposed or whether additional capital needs to be held against the risks not covered in pillar  pillar  this introduces public disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information and is aimed to encourage market discipline by providing market participants access to key information on a firms capital risk exposures and risk management processes the rules in bipru  set out the pillar  requirements this document is designed to meet the pillar  requirements the rules permit polygon to omit any information that is considered immaterial such that its omission would be unlikely to change or influence the decision of those relying on that information in addition polygon may omit required disclosures which it regards as propriety or confidential propriety information is that which may undermine polygons competitive position if it is shared information is considered to be confidential where there are obligations binding polygon to confidentiality with its customers suppliers and counterparties no omissions have been made on the grounds that the relevant information is propriety or confidential  certain information has been omitted on the ground that it is immaterial see the section headed items omitted from the pillar  disclosures  scope and application polygon is authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority the fca and as such is subject to minimum capital requirements based on its categorization as a bipru firm polygon serves or in the future may serve as the investment manager to various funds and other investment vehicles and accounts polygon does not form part of a consolidation group for prudential purposes the llp was authorised by the financial services authority from th  of may  and became authorised by the fca on st  of april   risk management and the risk management process polygon is governed by an executive committee the executive committee the risk committee and infrastructure committee report to the executive committee and with their input the executive committee determines the business strategy and risk appetite for polygon the executive committee includes polygons chief executive officer the ceo and chief investment officer for various reasons the executive committee considers that from a regulatory capital perspective polygon is a relatively low risk organization for example polygon does not directly take custody of any investor assets due to the small size of polygon and its relatively low risk profile the executive committee considers that polygon does not warrant the need for a separate risk management function within polygon risk management is undertaken by the risk committee with the assistance of the ceo together with support from internal compliance legal and operations teams in addition polygon retains external professional services firms for expert advice and consultation as and where considered appropriate the executive committee of polygon through formal and informal meetings is actively involved in determining polygons business strategy and implementing processes to mitigate risks polygons risk profile is assessed as part of the icaap process at least annually and more frequently as and when the need arises at the discretion of the executive committee the executive committee also determines how the risks polygon faces may be mitigated and assesses the arrangements to manage those risks on an ongoing basis the executive committee meets both formally and informally to discuss current projections for profitability cash flow regulatory capital management business planning and risk management the executive committee manages polygons business and identifies risks through a framework of policy and procedures taking account of relevant laws standards principles and rules including fca principles and rules with the aim of operating a defined and transparent risk management framework these policies and procedures are updated as required the executive committee has identified that credit business and operational and market risks are the main areas of risk to which polygon is exposed the executive committee formally review the risks controls and other risk mitigation arrangements and assesses their effectiveness where the executive committee identifies material risks it considers the financial impact of these risks as part of polygons business planning and capital management and concludes whether the amount of regulatory capital is adequate  credit risk client concentration polygons clients may include funds and other investment vehicles and accounts this may result in a high client concentration risk polygon is financially dependent upon the funds and separate accounts their continued support is enshrined in their management agreements  business and operational risk operational risk is defined by the fca as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events including legal risk the management committee has identified relevant risks and related mitigation and controls as part of its icaap review polygon has policies and procedures and ongoing operational and related compliance monitoring to help identify weaknesses and potential control failures which are required to be reported promptly when observed to the executive committee  market risk the executive committee believes that polygons market risks which include the potential effects of a long term downturn in financial markets and foreign currency exchange risk would not have a direct material effect on polygon due to its funding relationship with the funds  regulatory capital polygons capital position as at the year ended  december  was as follows capital item  tier  capital  total tier  and tier  capital      nil      deductions nil total available capital after deductions  the llp is a relatively small firm with a simple operational infrastructure the llps market risk is mainly limited to foreign exchange risk on its foreign currency cash balances in addition the llp is subject to credit risk on management and performance fees receivable from the funds the llp follows the standardised approach to market risk and the simplified standard approach to credit risk the llp is subject to the fixed overhead requirement and is not required to calculate operational risk capital though it considers this as part of its process to identify the level of risk based capital required polygon is a bipru firm for the purposes of the fcas capital requirements rules and as such its minimum capital requirement is the greatest of  the base capital requirement of € the sum of its market and credit risk requirements and the  week fixed overheads requirement for the executive committee considers that the available capital at  december  more than adequately exceeds the minimum capital requirement of the for the llps capital requirements for regulatory purposes as at the year ended  december  is summarised as follows requirement item  base capital requirement  sum of market and credit risk requirement  fixed overhead requirement  total available capital after deductions    as at  december  the llps regulatory capital requirement is  and the llps regulatory capital of  exceeds the minimum capital requirement by  as such the llps regulatory capital exceeds its regulatory capital requirement by  remuneration the llp maintains a written remuneration policy designed to comply with the rules and guidance relating to the fcas remuneration code as it applies to bipru firms the remuneration rules  the llps remuneration policy applies to its members and employees whose professional activities have a material impact on the llps risk profile remuneration code staff  the llps executive committee oversees the llps remuneration of remuneration code staff  the total compensation of remuneration code staff is generally structured as a base salary or in the case of llp members a fixed profit allocation and a yearend bonus or in the case of llp members a discretionary profit allocation  the payment of any such yearend bonus or yearend distribution of profits is subject to various conditions and the amount may be zero under certain circumstances  in the case of other remuneration code staff the amount of any yearend bonus or yearend distribution of profits is entirely discretionary and is based on a number of considerations including among other things the relevant member of staffs experience and performance in the role the overall performance of the investment strategy that the employee supports if applicable the profitability of the polygon group and competitive pay practices and industry benchmarks  the relative weight accorded to each of these factors is also discretionary a portion of any yearend bonus or as the case may be yearend distribution of profits awarded to remuneration code staff is subject to mandatory deferral  deferred amounts may be invested in one or more of the private investment funds managed by the polygon group andor shares in the firms listed affiliate tetragon financial group limited tfg  remuneration code staff who voluntarily elect to leave polygon other than in connection with retirement will typically forfeit all or significant portions of their unvested deferred compensation and thus have an economic incentive to remain with polygon polygon takes into account the specific nature of its own activities including the nature of its revenues in conducting any exante risk adjustments to yearend bonuses  polygon has elected not to make expost risk adjustments to yearend bonuses as permitted under the remuneration rules  polygon may however reduce prior year deferred compensation awards under certain circumstances  all remuneration code staff support polygons investment management activities polygons only business area for purposes of the remuneration rules and either are senior managers of polygon or perform a significant influence function     items omitted from the pillar  disclosures polygons  minimum capital requirement under pillar  is driven by its for and not the sum of its credit risk and market risk requirements  polygon has accordingly concluded that the detailed disclosure requirements in relation to credit risk and market risk set out in bipru r bipru r and bipru rr may be excluded from the pillar  disclosures on the grounds that they are immaterial in accordance with bipru r polygon does not engage in securitization activity and the securitization disclosures in bipru r are not applicable  polygon has therefore concluded that it is permitted to exclude such disclosures from the pillar  disclosures on the grounds that they are immaterial in accordance with bipru r commitment to the uk stewardship code under rule r of the fcas conduct of business sourcebook polygon global partners llp polygon is required to include on this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the uk financial reporting councils stewardship code the code or where it does not commit to the code its alternative investment strategy the code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with uk equity issuers polygon acts as the investment manager to one or more private investment funds and other accounts collectively the polygon clients polygons investment strategy is such that the polygon clients may hold long positions in equities including uk equities the code is therefore relevant to some aspects of polygons trading on behalf of the polygon clients while polygon generally supports the objectives that underlie the code it has chosen not to commit to the code polygons investment strategy involves the polygon clients holding positions in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions globally polygons approach in relation to engagement with issuers and members of their management teams in all of the jurisdictions in which the polygon clients invest is determined on a casebycase basis consequently polygon does not consider it appropriate to commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any individual jurisdiction      polygon global partners llp
