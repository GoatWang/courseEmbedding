€  sonder by motek on vinyl info ‘sonder’ was released on october nd  with a release show at the minardschouwburg in ghent every great passion ends in the infinite… likewise motek are driven by instinct for sultry recollections of forgotten emotional states chaos coincidence and stubbornness motek’s endless jam sessions result in combinations of melodies rhythms and creative flaws recording and relistening them motek are able to reconstruct a few ‘holy’ moments into their songs their sound is crafted by effectladen guitars wandering around needy bass and entrancing drums on stage motek combine their music with images imagery and imagination they are wellknown for their particular approach to live concerts interweaving songs and visuals into a vigorous performance like enolabe and nbhap mentioned before ‘motek is back’ going back to their post rocking roots was their starting point thus ‘sonder’ contains six tracks of beautiful and intense post rock like you are used to from their earlier work sonder means ‘the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own – populated with their own ambitions friends routines worries and inherited craziness – an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed in which you might appear only once as an extra sipping coffee in the background as a blur of traffic passing on the highway as a lighted window at dusk’ – source you’re awake walking through the door everybody is ecstatic lights are shimmering off of the glimmering faces each one unknown each visage new among it all you feel a sense of connection from where and why you feel it’s not meant to be understood as it is simply innate within each smile is a presence of you of us all a visage like a mirror inspiration unknown and unbeknownst vicariously you can see the world as whole together and always new and you move on as who this is the impact of motek’s new release sonder there is something to be said about the genre of “postrock” as it’s become known but more importantly instrumental music as a whole motek simply lays down this truth in an exemplary fashion these guys hail from the country of belgium and have grown up with what seems to be a very inquisitively relaxed state of mind one where the world around them only needs to be taken as seriously as it must one where appreciation is abundant one where people are more interested in understanding each other than judging their first impression sonder makes that human connection a constructive strength that makes the world feel like an exhilaratingly beautiful place to live in times like  it’s easy to be lost in the chaos that is abound this record finds a way to control all of that and make you feel at peace you’re at home interconnection is not a struggle but an everyday occurrence sonder is simply miraculous in it’s undertaking you will listen to this album and imagine many intricately thoughtful nights to create such an album when in reality it took these individuals two nights to carve out the majority of this sculpture as a band they found a wavelength and let pure innate and unorchestrated emotion take hold simply put they let it pour out as human beings who were built to expel this great music on the world source sly vinyl watch motek – ‘each random passerby’ the stargazer tv from wout on vimeo listen ampampampampamplta

must know how to effectively price propane it’s one of the most important skills for any ownermanager to hone randall r doyle price determines the margin that has a significant impact on the bottom line the  milliongallon marketer who earns an additional  cents per gallon increases the bottom line by  at least  percent of the profitability for most marketers that size a competitive price is crucial in the competition for the new customer it also affects the consumer’s perception of “good value” which is one of the propane education  research council’s five strategic elements for tracking propane’s effectiveness in the consumer market at a propane conference this past summer i asked the marketers to rank the toughest marketing challenges they face here’s what they said  how to price in a volatile market  how to price in a market of wideranging retail prices  eroding customer loyalty and credit worthiness  competition from electricity and other fuels  finding employees that deliver value and service  price wars it’s not surprising that the marketers said it’s tough being effective at product pricing in today’s market to help find the right pricing practices for your business follow the practices of today’s most savvy and astute propane marketers more than ever astute marketers are vigilant each day about pricing they understand that the pricing practices of the past do not work in today’s market they understand that current information on propane supply costs and pergallon bobtail operating costs must be known many however don’t know those costs savvy marketers are constantly in touch with their competitors’ pricing strategies having an effective response to their lowball firstfill price in addition they ready themselves to set tanks in the dead of winter when their competitors’ quality customers become outraged that they are paying a  cents or more premium per gallon finally their winter price hits that sweet spot of taking advantage of the margin updraft created by the premium priced marketers while being able to gain new quality customers on price the astute retailer markets propane as a utility their product offering blends a monthly budget pay program and a supply price cap this offering helps the marketer’s cash flow focuses the customer on the monthly energy cost and not the price per gallon and protects the consumer from the turbulent energy market everyone wins with this arrangement effective propane marketers know how to sell value ahead of price when a prospective customer calls “seventy percent of new customers want value and only  percent are looking for the lowest price” says kirk wright of pro image communications which designs marketing programs for the propane marketer “those marketers that know how to sell value will win that new valueminded customer  percent of the time it’s these valueminded customers that will stay with the company for at least eight years and are not likely to leave on price alone” price is just one aspect of effective marketing a marketing program should be about building longterm customer relations this is done by creating the perception of good value through excellent service marketers who deliver value improve their customer retention “customers that are provided quality service will stay longer and will be loyal i consistently see this principle at work” says wright market research also shows that companies across all industries that achieve the “superior quality” position will command on average an  percent higher price than businesses that are perceived to have lower quality for the propane marketer this is about  cents per gallon “i also see this with my clients they provide excellent service and as a result are able to command a higher price because they’ve earned it” says wright as each marketer creates that position with the consumer the entire industry wins in its battle against competing fuels especially electricity how is the propane industry doing in its battle to create the perception of good value with the consumer energy market not well perc’s most recent consumer education research reports that propane’s good value favorability score of  lags electricity’s score of  one year ago the difference was only five points a major cause for the decline is high crude oil prices which is beyond the marketer’s control thus it’s more important than ever that marketers do well with the things in their control – the practices that consistently deliver quality service build trust and build strong customer relations each time the consumer comes in contact with the propane company the perception is affected a positive experience builds the perception while a bad experience erodes it let’s look at the six points of contact between the customer and the propane marketer bobtail driver serviceman phone walk in traffic community involvement written communication including statements and invoices at the same propane conference last summer the propane marketers ranked the bobtail driver and phone the top two in importance given this there are several points to consider bobtail drivers should be managed as important ambassadors of your company and the industry drivers must know that their role is more than delivering propane they should be trained in customer service be courteous and appear neat and professional driver performance feedback and bonusrecognition should include an element of customer service practice effective phone skills which is a unique and essential discipline in today’s marketplace the most common interaction with the customer is by phone there are plenty of costeffective training programs on cd and on the internet that can be added to your employee training program select and develop your employees especially the csr on their ability to communicate solve customer issues and market by phone monthly statements should be easy to read and should send a positive message to the customer confusing statements erode customer trust and confidence build a strong facetoface relationship with the people in your community our rural american values tell us that people want to do business with people they know and respect this is what distinguishes propane from electricity with the energy consumer capitalize on it randy doyle a cpa and mba is a propane industry
