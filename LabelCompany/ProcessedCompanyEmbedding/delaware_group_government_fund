river the delaware indians a name used by europeans for lenape people indigenous to the delaware valley also derive their name from the same source the surname de la warr comes from sussex and is of anglonorman origin it came probably from a norman lieudit la guerre this toponymic could derive from the latin word ager from the breton gwern or from the late latin varectum fallow the toponyms gara gare gaire the sound ä often mutated in æ also appear in old texts cited by lucien musset where the word gaira means gore it could also be linked with a patronymic from the old norse verr geography

delaware together with the eastern shore counties of maryland and two counties of virginia form the delmarva peninsula which stretches down the midatlantic coast the definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual most of the boundary between delaware and pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending  miles  km from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of new castlecitation needed this boundary is often referred to as the twelvemile circleb this is the only nominally circular state boundary in the united statescitation needed this border extends all the way east to the lowtide mark on the new jersey shore then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the mile  km arc in the south then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel thalweg of the delaware river to the west a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of maryland the remaining western border runs slightly east of

the cleanup of property lightly contaminated by hazardous waste the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales history main article history of delaware native americans before delaware was settled by european colonists the area was home to the eastern algonquian tribes known as the unami lenape or delaware throughout the delaware valley and the nanticoke along the rivers leading into the chesapeake bay the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the midth century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their nonnative american neighborscitation needed colonial delaware new sweden – encounter between swedish colonists and the natives of delaware the dutch were the first europeans to settle in presentday delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at zwaanendael near the site of lewes in  within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area native american tribes in  new sweden a swedish trading post and colony was established at fort christina now in wilmington by peter minuit at the head of a group of swedes finns and dutch the colony of new sweden lasted for  years in  the dutch reinvigorated by the leadership of peter stuyvesant established a fort at presentday new castle and in  they conquered the new sweden colony annexing it into the dutch new netherland only nine years later in  the dutch were conquered by a fleet of english ships by sir robert carr under the direction of james the duke of york fighting off a prior claim by cecil calvert nd baron baltimore proprietor of maryland the duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to william penn in  penn strongly desired access to the sea for his pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the lower counties on the delaware from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in  however by  the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at philadelphia and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties the fact that delaware and pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique from  to  new york and new jersey shared a governor massachusetts and new hampshire also shared a governor for some time dependent in early years on indentured labor delaware imported more slaves as the number of english immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants continued to arrive american revolution like the other middle colonies the lower counties on the delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with britain the citizenry had a good relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer thomas mckean denounced the stamp act in the strongest terms and kent county native john dickinson became the penman of the revolution anticipating the declaration of independence patriot leaders thomas mckean and caesar rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separated from british and pennsylvania rule on june   the person best representing delawares majority george read could not bring himself to vote for a declaration of independence only the dramatic overnight ride of caesar rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast delawares vote for independence initially led by john haslet delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the continental army known as the delaware blues and nicknamed the blue hens chicks in august  general sir william howe led a british army through delaware on his way to a victory at the battle of brandywine and capture of the city of philadelphia the only real engagement on delaware soil was the battle of coochs bridge fought on september   at coochs bridge in new castle county following the battle of brandywine wilmington was occupied by the british and state president john mckinly was taken prisoner the british remained in control of the delaware river for much of the rest of the war disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active loyalist portion of the population particularly in sussex county because the british promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines following the american revolution statesmen from delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central united states

population boom the economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation most of the english colonists arrived as indentured servants under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and the working classes often lived closely together most of the free africanamerican families in delaware before the revolution had migrated from maryland to find more affordable land they were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved servant or free african or africanamerican men as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened at the end of the colonial period the number of enslaved people in delaware began to decline shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves labor local methodists and quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the american revolution and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons by  threequarters of all blacks in delaware were free when john dickinson freed his slaves in  he was

unami lenape or delaware throughout the delaware valley and the nanticoke along the rivers leading into the chesapeake bay the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the midth century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their nonnative american neighborscitation needed colonial delaware new sweden – encounter between swedish colonists and the natives of delaware the dutch were the first europeans to settle in presentday delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at zwaanendael near the site of lewes in  within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area native american tribes in  new sweden a swedish trading post and colony was established at fort christina now in wilmington by peter minuit at the head of a group of swedes finns and dutch the colony of new sweden lasted for  years in  the dutch reinvigorated by the leadership of peter stuyvesant established a fort at presentday new castle and in  they conquered the new sweden colony annexing it into the dutch new netherland only nine years later in  the dutch were conquered by a fleet of english ships by sir robert carr

 penn strongly desired access to the sea for his pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the lower counties on the delaware from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in  however by  the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at philadelphia and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties the fact that delaware and pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique from  to  new york and new jersey shared a governor massachusetts and new hampshire also shared a governor for some time dependent in early years on indentured labor delaware imported more slaves as the number of english immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants continued to arrive american revolution like the other middle colonies the lower counties on the delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with britain the citizenry had a good relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer thomas mckean denounced the stamp act in the strongest terms and kent county native john dickinson became the penman of the revolution anticipating the declaration of independence patriot leaders thomas mckean and caesar rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separated from british and pennsylvania rule on june   the person best representing delawares majority george read could not bring himself to vote for a declaration of independence only the dramatic overnight ride of caesar rodney gave the delegation the

state president john mckinly was taken prisoner the british remained in control of the delaware river for much of the rest of the war disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active

and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation most of the english colonists arrived as indentured servants under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and the working classes often lived closely together most of the free africanamerican

unami lenape or delaware throughout the delaware valley and the nanticoke along the rivers leading into the chesapeake bay the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the midth century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their nonnative american neighborscitation needed colonial delaware new sweden – encounter between swedish

valley also derive their name from the same source the surname de la warr comes from sussex and is of anglonorman origin it came probably from a norman lieudit la guerre this toponymic could derive from the latin word ager from the breton gwern or from the late latin varectum fallow the toponyms gara gare gaire the sound ä often mutated in æ also appear in old texts cited by lucien musset where

eastern side of the delaware river sharing land boundaries with new jersey the state of delaware together with the eastern shore counties of maryland and two counties of virginia form the delmarva peninsula which stretches down the midatlantic coast the definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual most of the boundary between delaware and pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending  miles  km from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of new castlecitation needed this boundary is often referred to as the twelvemile circleb this is the only nominally circular state boundary in the united statescitation needed this border extends all the way east to the lowtide mark on the new jersey shore then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the mile  km arc in the south then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel thalweg of the delaware river to the west a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of maryland the remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc the wedge of land between the northwest part of the arc and the maryland

chesapeake bay to the west climate since almost all of delaware is a part of the atlantic coastal plain the effects of the ocean moderate its climate the state lies in the humid subtropical climate zone despite its small size roughly  miles  km from its northernmost to southernmost points there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between sussex county and new

wholesale petroleum sales history main article history of delaware native americans before delaware was settled by european colonists the area was home to the eastern algonquian tribes known as the unami lenape or delaware throughout the delaware valley and the nanticoke along the rivers leading into the chesapeake bay the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the midth century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their nonnative american neighborscitation needed colonial delaware new sweden – encounter between swedish colonists and the natives of delaware the dutch were the first europeans to settle in presentday delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at zwaanendael near the site of lewes in  within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area native american tribes in  new sweden a swedish trading post and colony was established at fort christina now in wilmington by peter minuit at the head of a group of swedes finns and dutch the colony of new sweden lasted for  years in  the dutch reinvigorated by the leadership of peter stuyvesant established a fort at presentday new castle and in  they conquered the new sweden colony annexing it into the dutch new netherland only nine years later in  the dutch were conquered by a fleet of english ships by sir robert carr under the direction of james the duke of york fighting off a prior claim by cecil calvert nd baron baltimore proprietor of maryland the duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to william penn in  penn strongly desired access to the sea for his pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the lower counties on the delaware from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in  however by  the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at philadelphia and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties the fact that delaware and pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique from  to  new york and new jersey shared a governor massachusetts and new hampshire also shared a governor for some time dependent in early years on indentured labor delaware imported more slaves as the number of english immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants continued to arrive american revolution like the other middle colonies the lower counties on the delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with britain the citizenry had a good relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer thomas mckean denounced the stamp act in the strongest terms and kent county native john dickinson became the penman of the revolution anticipating the declaration of independence patriot leaders thomas mckean and caesar rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separated from british and pennsylvania rule on june   the person best representing delawares majority george read could not bring himself to vote for a declaration of independence only the dramatic overnight ride of caesar rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast delawares vote for independence initially led by john haslet delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the continental army known as the delaware blues and nicknamed the blue hens chicks in august  general sir william howe led a british army through delaware on his way to a victory at the battle of brandywine and capture of the city of philadelphia the only real engagement on delaware soil was the battle of coochs bridge fought on september   at coochs bridge in new castle county following the battle of brandywine wilmington was occupied by the british and state president john mckinly was taken prisoner the british remained in control of the delaware river for much of the rest of the war disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active loyalist portion of the population particularly in sussex county because the british promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines following the american revolution statesmen from delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central united states with equal representation for each state slavery and race this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed april  learn how and when to remove this template message many colonial settlers came to delaware from maryland and virginia which had been experiencing a population boom the economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation most of the english colonists arrived as indentured servants under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and the working classes often lived closely together most of the free africanamerican families in delaware before the revolution had migrated from maryland to find more affordable land they were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved servant or free african or africanamerican men as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened at the end of the colonial period the number of enslaved people in delaware began to decline shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves labor local methodists and quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the american revolution and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons by

eastern side of the delaware river sharing land boundaries with new jersey the state of delaware together with the eastern shore counties of maryland and two counties of virginia form the delmarva peninsula which stretches down the midatlantic coast the definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual most of the boundary between delaware and pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending  miles  km from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of new castlecitation needed this boundary is often referred to as the twelvemile circleb this is the only nominally circular state boundary in the united statescitation needed this border extends all the way east to the lowtide mark on the new jersey shore then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the mile  km arc in the south then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel thalweg of the delaware river to the west a portion of the arc extends past the

wholesale petroleum sales history main article history of delaware native americans before delaware was settled by european colonists the area was home to the eastern algonquian tribes known as the unami lenape or delaware throughout the delaware valley and the nanticoke along the rivers leading into the chesapeake bay the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the midth century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their nonnative american neighborscitation needed colonial delaware new sweden – encounter between swedish colonists and the natives of delaware the dutch were the first europeans to settle in presentday delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at zwaanendael near the site of lewes in  within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area native american tribes in  new sweden a swedish trading post and colony was established at fort christina now in wilmington by peter minuit at the head of a group of swedes finns and dutch the colony of new sweden lasted for  years in  the dutch reinvigorated by the leadership of peter stuyvesant established a fort at presentday new castle and in  they conquered the new sweden colony annexing it into the dutch new netherland only nine years later in  the dutch were conquered by a fleet of english ships by sir robert carr under the direction of james the duke of york fighting off a prior claim by cecil calvert nd baron baltimore proprietor of maryland the duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to william penn in  penn strongly desired access to the sea for his pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the lower counties on the delaware from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in  however by  the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at philadelphia and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties the fact that delaware and pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique from  to  new york and new jersey shared a governor massachusetts and new hampshire also shared a governor for some time dependent in early years on indentured labor delaware imported more slaves as the number of english immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants continued to arrive american revolution like the other middle colonies the lower counties on the delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with britain the citizenry had a good relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer thomas mckean denounced the stamp act in the strongest terms and kent county native john dickinson became the penman of the revolution anticipating the declaration of independence patriot leaders thomas mckean and caesar rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separated from british and pennsylvania rule on june   the person best representing delawares majority george read could not bring himself to vote for a declaration of independence only the dramatic overnight ride of caesar rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast delawares vote for independence initially led by john haslet delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the continental army known as the delaware blues and nicknamed the blue hens chicks in august  general sir william howe led a british army through delaware on his way to a victory at the battle of brandywine and capture of the city of philadelphia the only real engagement on delaware soil was the battle of coochs bridge fought on september   at coochs bridge in new castle county following the battle of brandywine wilmington was occupied by the british and state president john mckinly was taken prisoner the british remained in control of the delaware river for much of the rest of the war disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active loyalist portion of the population particularly in sussex county because the british promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines following

and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation most of the english colonists arrived as indentured servants under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and the working classes often lived closely together most of the free africanamerican families in delaware before the revolution had migrated from maryland to find more affordable land they were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved servant or free african or africanamerican men as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened at the end of the colonial period the number of enslaved people in delaware began to decline shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for

unami lenape or delaware throughout the delaware valley and the nanticoke along the rivers leading into the chesapeake bay the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the midth century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their nonnative american neighborscitation needed colonial delaware new sweden – encounter between swedish

without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at philadelphia and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of

slaves as the number of english immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants

relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer thomas mckean denounced the stamp act in the strongest terms and kent county native john dickinson became the penman of the revolution

eastern side of the delaware river sharing land boundaries with new jersey the state of delaware together with the eastern shore counties of maryland and two counties of virginia form the delmarva peninsula which stretches down the midatlantic coast the definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual most of the boundary between delaware and pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending  miles  km from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of new castlecitation needed this boundary is often referred to as the twelvemile circleb this is the only nominally circular state boundary in the united statescitation needed this border extends all the way east to the lowtide mark on the new jersey shore then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the mile  km arc in the south then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel thalweg of the delaware river to the west a portion of the arc extends past the

wholesale petroleum sales history main article history of delaware native americans before delaware was settled by european colonists the area was home to the eastern algonquian tribes known as the unami lenape or delaware throughout the delaware valley and the nanticoke along the rivers leading into the chesapeake bay the unami lenape in the delaware valley were closely related to munsee lenape tribes along the hudson river they had a settled hunting and agricultural society and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy the minqua or susquehannock with the loss of their lands on the delaware river and the destruction of the minqua by the iroquois of the five nations in the s the remnants of the lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the alleghany mountains by the midth century generally those who did not relocate out of the state of delaware were baptized became christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their nonnative american neighborscitation needed colonial delaware new sweden – encounter between swedish colonists and the natives of delaware the dutch were the first europeans to settle in presentday delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at zwaanendael near the site of lewes in  within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area native american tribes in  new sweden a swedish trading post and colony was established at fort christina now in wilmington by peter minuit at the head of a group of swedes finns and dutch the colony of new sweden lasted for  years in  the dutch reinvigorated by the leadership of peter stuyvesant established a fort at presentday new castle and in  they conquered the new sweden colony annexing it into the dutch new netherland only nine years later in  the dutch were conquered by a fleet of english ships by sir robert carr under the direction of james the duke of york fighting off a prior claim by cecil calvert nd baron baltimore proprietor of maryland the duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to william penn in  penn strongly desired access to the sea for his pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the lower counties on the delaware from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in  however by  the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at philadelphia and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties the fact that delaware and pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique from  to  new york and new jersey shared a governor massachusetts and new hampshire also shared a governor for some time dependent in early years on indentured labor delaware imported more slaves as the number of english immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants continued to arrive american revolution like the other middle colonies the lower counties on the delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with britain the citizenry had a good relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer thomas mckean denounced the stamp act in the strongest terms and kent county native john dickinson became the penman of the revolution anticipating the declaration of independence patriot leaders thomas mckean and caesar rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separated from british and pennsylvania rule on june   the person best representing delawares majority george read could not bring himself to vote for a declaration of independence only the dramatic overnight ride of caesar rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast delawares vote for independence initially led by john haslet delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the continental army known as the delaware blues and nicknamed the blue hens chicks in august  general sir william howe led a british army through delaware on his way to a victory at the battle of brandywine and capture of the city of philadelphia the only real engagement on delaware soil was the battle of coochs bridge fought on september   at coochs bridge in new castle county following the battle of brandywine wilmington was occupied by the british and state president john mckinly was taken prisoner the british remained in control of the delaware river for much of the rest of the war disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active loyalist portion of the population particularly in sussex county because the british promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines following the american revolution statesmen from delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central united states with equal representation for each state slavery and race this section needs

template message many colonial settlers came to delaware from maryland and virginia which had been experiencing a population boom the economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation most of the english colonists arrived as indentured servants under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and the working classes often lived closely together most of the free africanamerican families in delaware before the revolution had migrated from maryland to find more affordable land they were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved servant or free african or africanamerican men as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened at the end of the colonial period the number of enslaved people in delaware began to decline shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for
