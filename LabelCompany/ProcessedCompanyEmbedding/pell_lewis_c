director lewis c pell files definitive proxy statement and lays out case for change at cogentix director lewis c pell files definitive proxy statement and lays out case for change at cogentix annual meeting urges stockholders to vote the green proxy card today to protect the value of their investmentraises objections to lavish employment package of the chief executive officer and chairman of the board robert kill approved by board allies news provided by lewis c pell apr    et share this article orangeburg ny and minneapolis april   prnewswire  lewis c pell one of the largest stockholders sitting director and largest debt holder of cogentix medical inc cogentix or the company nasdaq cgnt has commenced a proxy campaign nominating two incumbent directors including himself and one independent director for election to the companys board at the  annual meeting  mr pell has sole voting power over  shares of cogentix common stock representing approximately  percent of outstanding shares  he holds more shares of cogentix common stock than all other members of the board combined  in contrast to others in leadership this fact unites mr pells interests with those of the broader shareholder base mr pell issued an open letter to cogentix stockholders addressing the companys poor performance misguided actions and empty vision from the companys leadership as well as the overall need for experienced leaders unaligned with the ceo to have a voice in the boardroom   the full text of the letter is as follows april   dear stockholders of cogentix as one of the largest stockholders of cogentix with over  million invested in the company i am very concerned about the future of our investment  just like you i am deeply disappointed by consistent dismal stockholder returns an absence of strategic vision and troubling actions of selfserving leadership it has been oneyear since the merger of visionsciences and uroplasty the merger – which resulted in cogentix as someone who has founded numerous companies in the medical technology sector i have been disheartened by the conduct of former uroplasty directors who now represent a majority of the cogentix board  the former uroplasty directors have thwarted all attempts to hold mr kill accountable for dismal performance and continue to reward him with a compensation package which is grossly out of line with our performance  not surprisingly these selfinterested directors and mr kill lack a meaningful stake in the company  in fact mr kill is an operating partner at a private equity firm in addition to his role as ceo of cogentix  stockholders should ask if these selfinterested actors are appropriately aligned with the longterm value creation of this company or more aligned with the ceo after exhausting all efforts of quiet diplomacy at the board level i am left with no choice but to take this cause public  in all my years serving on public boards never once have i needed to publicly push for change  the severity of the situation and my belief that change is absolutely required in order for this company to succeed in the future are forcing me to act the merger of visionsciences and uroplasty the merger was intended to create a stronger company well positioned to capitalize on market dynamics to leverage the strength of key assets pursue opportunistic growth and generate stockholder value  none of the promise of the merger has been achieved instead stockholders have been subjected to among other things the following share price has dropped  since the merger closed management has failed to outline its strategy for dealing with increased competitive pressure from a larger medical device company no filings or announcements of new products or potential partnerships have been made despite the companys own claims that urology may be the most indemand specialty by   the company has failed to provide revenue guidance for  many key management positions including the chief financial officer have been vacated in the  months since the merger closed and have gone unfilled or consolidated under the current ceo  the consolidation of all these positions in a single individual is troublesome and inconsistent with best practices for corporate governance  mr kill is now the president ceo chairman principal accounting officer and corporate secretary all while he is separately an operating partner with altamont capital partners a private equity firm based in palo alto ca board members are leaving with one director resigning while another has voluntarily chosen to not stand for reelection to the board over the past three fiscal years mr kills cumulative pay equaled  million while the company he lead lost  million vote the green proxy card today to protect the future of your investment we can no longer wait on the sidelines the company is in desperate need of highly qualified proven directors that can work to guide the company to unlock stockholder value  as a stockholder with significant equity and debt interest in this company i want cogentix to thrive  any statement indicating my interest is in bankruptcy of this company is plainly false and ignores my long history of building value for stockholders  i believe strongly there is ample opportunity but limited time  this is why i am proposing to elect three director nominees howard i zauberman james a dorta and myself to the board of directors of the company to serve until the  annual meeting of stockholders i strongly believe that these candidates bring a deep understanding of the dynamics of the market place and can institute a system of checks and balances to ensure that compensation and other corporate governance actions are fairly considered and made in order to promote stockholder value despite consistent failures the board led by the former uroplasty directors once again determined to award mr kill an outsized pay package  as stockholders we should not stand by while companys full potential is being lost to selfserving actions   stockholders should consider some key facts about mr kills total annualized compensation of  million mr kills pay reflects approximately  of cogentix total revenue since the merger which is the second highest among the companys compensation peer group as recently this month the minneapolisst paul business journal identified mr kill as one of the most overpaid executives in the minneapolis area – which damages the companys reputation in the market mr kills allies approved his excessive compensation when the funds could have been put to rd and other productive business purposes instead the companys compensation peer group includes supposed peer companies that have a market capitalization that are approximately x greater than cogentix led by the uroplasty directors the board approved additional benefits to mr kills compensation including a provision where the company essentially pays the ceos tax bill despite majority of stockholders voting against executive compensation package say on pay proposal in  and the negative recommendation of an independent proxy advisory firm no independent consultant was used to evaluate the fairness or effectiveness of mr kills compensation package  in light of the companys failure to address competitive pressures and the declining share price stockholders must ask what exactly is mr kill doing to earn such significant compensation  i truly believe that significant opportunities to enhance financial performance and stockholder value can be achieved if we have the right governance and leadership team in place we look forward to your support at the  annual meeting your vote is very important no matter how many shares you own please vote the green proxy card today to bring qualified proven leadership to the board sincerely lewis c pell if you have any questions or require assistance in authorizing a proxy or voting your shares of common stock please contact alliance advisors llc

share tweet email print more share on share on linkedin share on google share on pinterest copy shortlink purchase order reprint lee schafer leeaschafer the boardroom conflict at cogentix medical doesn’t really resemble the typical campaign of an activist investor in part because the unhappy shareholder here is not a yearold hedge fund manager but a legendary entrepreneur in the medicaldevice industry the other thing that’s odd about this one is that the disgruntled investor lewis c pell doesn’t seem to have much of a case against management it is true that he’s been involved almost a year and hasn’t made money yet given that he had already been involved for more than  years in one of the struggling little companies that formed cogentix though one would think he might be a little more patient formed from a merger of minnetonkabased uroplasty with the little company pell served as chairman called visionsciences cogentix has yet to celebrate its first birthday when the deal was announced ceo rob kill told investors to expect the new company to get to about  million in revenue in its first full year based on results for the first three quarters the company would about hit  million if its last quarter showed no growth at all “and each quarter we’ve been growing” kill said “so yeah i’d say we’re on track” kill did not direct any personal criticism at pell who joined the board of cogentix with the merger kill did acknowledge that having pell make sure his criticism became public via a letter attached to a regulatory filing surprised him pell’s letter laying out a case for change was addressed to the board he didn’t respond to a voice message left at his business in suburban new york but in his letter he said he was “deeply disappointed” by the “empty vision” of the management team and board of directors amid complaints about ceo compensation and a few other matters pell’s main point seemed to be that the price of cogentix’s stock has declined since the deal that’s certainly accurate enough with the stock closing the day of the merger at  per share while earlier this week it traded for  per share pell must be aware that it’s been a disappointing year for investors almost across the board in small device makers the median return over the last year in device companies of less than  million in market capitalization was a loss of nearly  percent according to data from the information service factset pell also seems to know what makes a good deal with a career in medical devices that brings to mind the minnesota serial entrepreneur manuel villafana now in his s pell’s biographical sketch on the website of another device company explained that he’s been the lead investor or cofounder of  medicaldevice manufacturers including eight sold for a collective net gain of  billion one was bought by the big device maker cr bard one went to johnson  johnson and another was acquired by boston scientific fridleybased medtronic bought two one of the two dozen was visionsciences the successor to operations that originally got going in  the company’s key technology was called endosheath a disposable sterile barrier between the patient and the endoscopes used in diagnostic and surgical procedures more than  years later visionsciences still hadn’t gone to a big industry consolidator like medtronic or cr bard in fact it was going nowhere its last annual filing with the securities and exchange commission before the merger summarized the situation neatly in just one sentence “we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain a profitable level of operations in the future” it was pell who kept the company funded loaning visionsciences more than  million in the form of convertible notes meanwhile back in minnesota uroplasty essentially had the same basic problem as visionsciences it had created product lines just popular enough with customers to have a business but not popular enough to let the business make any money at least not after paying for corporate overhead and a direct sales force getting more products for uroplasty’s person us sales force to sell was one of the main reasons for bringing the companies together the sales reps would be both more efficient as well as more important with customers who would have more reason to agree to a meeting in addition to growing sales of existing product lines the company would be looking for additional products to develop or acquire that these salespeople could sell as to how it’s unfolded “all you have to do is look at the results for the last quarter” kill said “neither company was growing at the rate that it’s growing now and that’s what we said that we would grow the combined company faster than either one would as a standalone company” in the quarter that ended in december the most recently reported sales increased  percent compared with the combined revenue total of the two companies for the same period a year earlier the company also generated cash operating income which excludes the noncash expenses like depreciation as well as costs related to the merger of nearly  that might not seem like a lot but kill pointed out that neither company had ever before generated a cash operating profit to wayzata money manager richard w perkins a shareholder and early investor in uroplasty this all looks like kill has made a lot of progress perkins said he’s just as puzzled by the complaints in pell’s letter as kill said he was pell still has his board seat and remains the holder of  million of notes and about  percent of cogentix’s stock it’s far from clear with a minority stock position that he has a next step perkins said that’s fine with him “rob is going to make this work” perkins said of kill “there are impediments along the way and this is just one of them”   lee schafer came to the star tribune after  years as a corporate officer consultant and investment

stecker fox rothschild llp minneapolis minnesota  counsel for defendants opinionnominal defendant cogentix medical inc the “company” has scheduled its annual meeting for may   the “annual meeting”  before the actions challenged in this case its board of directors the “board” had eight seats staggered into three classes  three were designated for class i directors three for class ii directors and two for class iii directors  the class i directors will stand for election at the annual meetingbefore the events giving rise to this litigation the eight members of the board were aligned to varying degrees with either plaintiff lewis c pell or defendant robert c kill pell is a class i director and the companys largest stockholder  he was a cofounder and chairman of the board of vision–sciences inc “vsi” one of two constituent corporations that merged to form cogentix  two other members of the board were former directors of vsikill is a class iii director and the companys incumbent ceo president and chairman of the board  he was ceo president and chairman of uroplasty inc the second of the two constituent corporations that merged to form cogentix  four other members of the board were former directors of uroplastyon february   pell filed an amendment to his schedule d in which he publicly disclosed his intention to seek changes in the composition of the board and the management team  the other directors understood that if pell did not get his way he intended to wage a proxy contest to elect himself and two allies as class i directors  over the next six weeks it became clear that pell wanted kill terminated and kills closest allies defendants kenneth h paulus and kevin h roche to leave the boardthe directors other than pell and kill attempted to find a negotiated solution but kill paulus and roche needed a plan b one of the class i seats was held by a legacyuroplasty director so if the negotiations failed pells proxy contest could change the balance in the boardroom from a fivetothree majority to a fourtofour deadlock  matters became more serious when a legacyuroplasty director in class ii resigned  at that point if pell succeeded in electing three class i directors the balance could flip to a fourtothree majority in pells favoras their plan b kill paulus and roche developed a strategy to shrink the size of the board from eight seats to five and reduce the number of class i seats to one the “board reduction plan”  during a meeting of the board held on march   the directors voted along party lines to approve the board reduction plan a reduction from eight seats to seven took place immediately eliminating the vacancy created by the resignation of the class ii director  the reduction from seven seats to five will become effective at the annual meeting  kill roche and paulus voted in favor  so did the fourth legacyuroplasty director defendant james p stauner who had decided not to stand for reelection  pell and the two legacyvsi directors voted againstthrough the board reduction plan kill roche paulus and stauner the “defendant directors” sought to preserve the legacyuroplasty directors control over the board and neutralize the threat of pells proxy contest  before the board reduction plan the companys stockholders had the opportunity to elect three nominees to the class i seats potentially establishing a new board majority  by reducing the number of class i seats the defendant directors ensured that no matter how the stockholders voted they would retain a threetotwo majorityalthough the point is contested i assume for purposes of analysis that the defendant directors sought to preserve their control not to extract personal benefits but rather for the selfless purpose of overseeing a thorough and deliberative process after the annual meeting to reconstitute the board with independent directors that they would identify vet and select  the problem is that when facing an electoral contest incumbent directors are not entitled to determine the outcome for the stockholders  stockholders elect directors not the other way around  even assuming that the defendant directors acted for an unselfish purpose they still acted inequitably  a preliminary injunction shall issue enjoining the company from implementing the portion of the board reduction plan that otherwise would become effective at the annual meetingi factual backgroundthe facts are drawn from the record developed in connection with the application for a preliminary injunction  the parties have submitted numerous documentary exhibits and deposition testimony from five fact witnessesafter the depositions were completed both sides submitted affidavits from witnesses who had been deposed  the affiants counsel could have elicited the averments in the affidavits when the witnesses depositions were taking place as they did on other matters  had they done so opposing counsel could have tested the assertions through crossexamination  because the lawyers eschewed that course this decision largely discounts the affidavits  it relies most heavily on the contemporaneous documentswhat follows are the facts as they are likely to be found after trial based on the current record  this is a probabilistic exercise  to make the implicit explicit the eventual findings of fact after trial could be differentb the company and its governance structurecogentix is a delaware corporation headquartered in minnetonka minnesota  the company designs develops manufactures and markets medical device products for specialty medical markets such as urology gynecology and bariatric medicine  its common stock trades on nasdaq under the symbol “cgnt”cogentix was formed through a stockforstock merger between two nasdaqlisted companies  vsi and uroplasty  the transaction closed on march   the “merger”  technically vsi acquired uroplasty through a reversetriangular merger  after the transaction closed vsi changed its name to cogentixin corporate governance terms uroplasty was the acquirer  its former stockholders emerged owning approximately  of cogentix and its management team continued at the helm of the combined company  kill had been uroplastys president ceo and chairman of the board before the merger  he assumed the same roles at cogentix  nonparty brett reynolds had been uroplastys chief financial officer  he took on that role for cogentixmore importantly for present purposes legacyuroplasty directors commanded a majority of the companys eight board seats  five seats were held by former directors of uroplasty comprising the defendant directors and nonparty sven a wehrwein  three seats were held by former directors of vsi comprising pell and nonparties cheryl pegus and howard i zaubermanfor pell and zauberman the merger involved stepping back from more active roles at vsi pell was vsis cofounder and its chairman  pell gave up the chairman title to kill and continued only as a director although he appears to have been kept on the payroll as an employee been given an office in the companys headquarters and been provided with an assistant and a driver  he also continued to have significant influence through his ownership of  of cogentixs outstanding shares which made him its second largest stockholder and his status as the companys largest creditor having loaned vsi a total of  million  zauberman had been the president and ceo of vsi and a director before the merger  he continued only as a directorbefore the merger section  of article twelfth of vsis certificate of incorporation the “charter” empowered its board of directors to determine by resolution the total number of directors comprising the full board  the provision statedthe number of directors of the corporation shall not be less than three  the exact number of directors within the limitations specified in the preceding sentence shall be fixed from time to time pursuant to a resolution adopted by the board of directorsroche aff ex a at   the provision remained in effect after the mergerbefore the merger section  of article twelfth of vsis charter divided the board into three classes  it statedthe board of directors shall be and is divided into three classes  class i class ii and class iii no one class shall have more than one director more than any other class  if a fraction is contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the designated number of directors by three then if such fraction is onethird the extra director shall be a member of class i and if such fraction is twothirds one of the extra directors shall be a member of class i and one of the extra directors shall be a member of class ii unless otherwise provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the board of directorsid this provision also remained in effect after the merger before the merger the uroplasty board had five members and the vsi board had six  to accommodate the agreedupon postmerger governance structure the vsi board exercised its authority to increase the number of directors to eight  the postmerger directors were allocated by class as follows with the parenthetical letter denoting whether the individual was a legacyuroplasty or legacyvsi directortabular or graphical material not displayable at this timeas required by nasdaq rule  the postmerger board established three standing committees  the audit committee the compensation committee and the governance and nominating committee the “nominating committee”  the composition of the committees was as followstabular or graphical material not displayable at this timelegacy–uroplasty directors thus chaired all three committees and constituted at least a majority of each committees membersc disputes arisedisputes immediately arose between the leaders of the two predecessor companies  on the day after the merger closed kill visited pell at the former vsi headquarters in orangeburg new york kill and pell dispute what was said but it is clear that the meeting did not go well  by the end of the week pell was threatening to have kill fired as ceo see kill dep  –  roche dep –  stauner dep –kill reported these incidents to the audit committee  the audit committee reprimanded pell but did not take further disciplinary action  kill viewed this response as inadequate  he hired counsel and sent a letter to the audit committee to express his dissatisfaction with the process investigation and results  over the ensuing months tensions grewd the february  letterthe boardroom temperature rose significantly on february   when pell sent his fellow directors an open letter in which he expressed his desire to change the management team and signaled his willingness to run a proxy contest  stulhman aff ex  the “february  letter”  pell told the other directors that he was “deeply disappointed by ․ the unsatisfactory performance and empty vision of the companys leadership at both the executive management and board levels”  id at  he also stated “i cannot stand by while the current executive management and board leadership jeopardize the companys full potential”  idthe bulk of pells letter took aim at the companys performance under kill pell noted that the companys stock price was “down approximately  since the announcement of the merger” and that the companys total market capitalization was less than its outstanding indebtedness  id pell objected to kill simultaneously holding the positions of chairman president and ceo through which pell believed kill exercised “far too much control over the company and the board”  id pell also noted thatexcept for me none of the other board members actually have significant stockholdings in the company and as a result their interests are not sufficiently aligned with shareholders  instead most of the other board members are closely and personally aligned with mr kill although the board obviously should act as an independent monitor and check on mr kills authority and decisionmaking there are examples of its failures to do soid the letter cited kills compensation package which it described as “grossly out of line with what is warranted”  id the letter noted that “despite the fact that shareholders overwhelmingly recommended against that level of pay the board majority still opted to bestow it on mr kill to whom they appear beholden”  id the letter also cited the recent departure of “the companys wellregarded cfo” which “left us in a position with no choice but to expand kills power beyond his positions as chair president and ceo to include the principal accounting officer function as well”  idthe february  letter also criticized the companys lack of strategic visionnot only have mr kill and his board allies presided over the loss of enormous shareholder value but they have no sound strategy in place to put the company on the path to achieve success․  i am suspicious that management and its board allies may be more interested in finding means to generate shortterm cash in order to pay for mr kills level of salary and to cover the companys financial failures elsewhere  the answer however is not about shortsighted asset sales but about building relationships and sic with the medical community end users of our current and future products—something which i know firsthand is a necessary ingredient for success in our business but which our ceo does not do nor evidently understandid at –finally pell reiterated his intent to take action  “given these failures on the part of the executive and board leadership i cannot silently watch missed opportunities for what can and should be a truly winning venture”  id at  he stated that he was “making known my goal and intentions to explore how best to make fundamental changes to the leadership of the company both at the executive and board levels”  idalthough pell previously had made similar threats internally this time he simultaneously filed his letter publicly as an amendment to his schedule d he did so he explained because he felt that “all shareholders should be aware of these serious issues regarding the company”  ide the february  meetingon february   two days after pell sent the february  letter the board held a regularly scheduled meeting the “february  meeting”  among other items the board selected the date for the annual meeting  the board also received reports from management regarding various aspects of the companys businessafter concluding their normal business the directors other than pell and kill met in executive session  kill was the ceo and pell was technically an employee so this decision refers to the other directors as the “outside directors”the outside directors began the executive session by calling in pell and discussing the february  letter  pell explained that he wanted kill terminated and would take action to achieve that goal if necessary  he indicated that he had the support of approximately  of the companys stockholders and implied that he was prepared to change the composition of the board  everyone understood that pell was threatening a proxy contextnext the outside directors excused pell called in kill and questioned him about pells allegations  kill felt attacked and believed he was being forced to defend his job  see kill dep –finally the outside directors met without pell and kill they designated stauner and paulus to attempt to negotiate a middle groundf the outside directors choose sidesalthough this fact is mildly contested the record demonstrates that the february  letter and the february  meeting caused the outside directors to choose sides between pell and kill which they did with varying degrees of conviction  generally speaking the legacyuroplasty directors aligned with kill and the legacyvsi directors aligned with pell see eg kill dep –  in making this observation i am not suggesting that the legacy directors were beholden to or controlled by either pell or kill but human interactions are complex  the outside directors understandably had views about who was in the right and their personal and professional relationships influenced their viewsamong the outside directors roche and paulus emerged as kills closest allies  the contemporaneous documents illustrate this  for example shortly after pell sent the february  letter wehrwein began talking about resigning from the board  roche sought to bolster wehrweins resolve by sending him an email in which he expressed his intent to stand by kill and work through the issues that pell was raisingwe got into this situation in part because we thought the merger was the solution to an intolerable position at uroplasty  we thought we needed to do something and we may not have been wrong and here we are  so i am actually perfectly happy to find some way to let the cornerstone of the intolerable situation stay as is and see if we can make it work as well as possibleand just so i am clear with you and i told paulus the same thing i will never abandon kill in this situation not because it is kill but because i dont think his leaving would be in the best interests of the shareholders and i wont give in to trumplike bullying everstuhlman aff ex  at  emphasis addedafter the february  meeting wehrwein reiterated that he was thinking about resigning  roche again encouraged him not to resign telling him that his presence was “invaluable”  stuhlman aff ex  at  wehrwein mentioned in response that pell “may have a point of view of my tenure” and “clearly doesnt like me”  id roche shot backi would not spend one second worrying about what pell does or doesnt think just consider the speaker  and i am determined that pell will never in any way control the board  that would be ruinous for the shareholders  i feel terrible about this i feel like we appeased the villain pell and punished killid kill roche and paulus exchanged numerous emails among themselves about how to respond to pell and his proxy contestwehrwein and stauner were in a different position  they both supported kill but neither was committed to an allout fight  pell regarded stauner and wehrwein as more independent than roche and paulus and he would later suggest that the board form a special committee with stauner and wehrwein as its only members that would be tasked with trying to resolve the companys management and board governance issuessimilar gradations of allegiance operated on pells side  zauberman had served as the ceo of vsi and was pells strongest ally  he vocally supported pell pegus was aligned with pell but less openly and seemingly less closelyg plan a and plan bafter the february  meeting the factual story becomes complicated with multiple threads proceeding in parallel  the central actor for the plaintiff was pell who continued to push openly and publicly for change at the company  zauberman actively supported and assisted pellthe central actors for the defendants were kill roche and paulus  in addition to being kills strongest supporters roche and paulus comprised a majority of the threemember nominating committee and roche served as its chair  this put roche and paulus at the center of the boardlevel governance struggleafter the february  meeting kill roche and paulus saw two possible paths  one path—plan a—was for the outside directors to broker a negotiated resolution between pell and kill among themselves kill roche and paulus discussed possible terms such as whether kill would need to leave the company and whether pell would enter into a standstill agreement or stockholder voting agreement  as part of plan a roche and paulus led the outside directors in an effort to identify director nominees who might be acceptable to both pell and kill they hoped they could avoid a proxy contest if the nominating committee could find suitable nomineesbut if a negotiated resolution failed and suitable nominees could not be found in time then kill roche and paulus needed a plan b under those circumstances they believed pell would launch a proxy contest to elect himself zauberman and a third class i director who would be allied with pell if pell succeeded it would change the reality in the boardroom from a fivetothree majority in favor of the legacyuroplasty directors to a fourfour split  kill roche and paulus regarded that outcome as unacceptable  they appear to have believed sincerely that pell would use his increased boardlevel influence to the detriment of the company and its stockholderskill roche and paulus needed a plan b that would preempt the threat of pells proxy contest and they hit upon the board reduction plan as a solution  by email dated february   kill suggested to paulus what he thought the board should do if pell was “not in a compromising mood”tell pell and his assistant that they are terminated immediately as employees and no longer allowed to enter our office ․ tell them that they can come back on saturday to remove their personal belongings under supervision go to a  person board by not renominating zauberman and stauner and tell pell that he and pegus will be in the upcoming class which avoids any proxy fightstuhlman aff ex  at  notably kills email expressly linked the board reduction plan to “avoiding any proxy fight”later that day kill followed up with paulus and reiterated his belief that the board reduction plan would prove necessaryyouve convinced me that i underestimate pells crazy factor  he will not be reasonable this week  once that happens stauner and wehrwein need to have the common sense and integrity to do whats right after watching pell in action at this weeks meeting  whats right is the below plan ie the board reduction plan kill set out in the email quoted above  then we temporarily upsize the board by two after the annual meeting i think i already have two independents that would take on the risk and be good for darin hammers formerly uroplastys senior vice president of global sales and marketing and currently the companys chief operating officer  and we can then execute the orderly transition for you me and roche without shareholder disruption  the bottom line is that pell cant be calling the shots ․ and he needs to know there are solutions not good for him if he isnt willing to play ballstuhlman aff ex  at  in this email kill linked the board reduction plan to i avoiding a proxy contest termed euphemistically as “shareholder disruption” and ii enabling the defendant directors not the stockholders to determine who would serve as directors of the company  the latter would be accomplished by upsizing the board after the annual meeting and executing an “orderly transition” for kill roche and paulusby email dated february   paulus told roche that he was largely committed to the board reduction plan as plan bbeen thinking a lot about this over the weekend  feel like we appeased the villain pell and punished the good guy kill anyhow a couple of things that i think would be important in the discussion and understanding with pell․  the third is that he will accept and agree to vote for give his proxy for the nominating committees recommendations for the board  if pell wont agree to the board thing then i think we need to persuade stauner that the best option is to downsize the board—dont replace stauner if he leaves and eliminate zaubermans seatstuhlman aff ex  at that same day paulus emailed kill about the need “to figure out where we go from here once he pell blows us off once

right and downsize the board  it will be a solid – after that and you paulus and roche will still control the nominating committee”  id emphasis added  kill thus tied the board reduction plan explicitly to retaining a board majority and the ability to use the nominating committee after the annual meeting to reconstitute the board  a few days later kill again linked the board reduction plan to permitting the defendant directors to choose who would serve on the board  see stuhlman aff ex  at  kill writing “i need to understand your roches strategy downsize to  or  and add later or add now to replace zauberman and stauner ”h the initial negotiations failmeanwhile after the executive session on february   stauner and paulus tried to schedule a meeting with pell to see if the three of them could “reach a mutually agreeable solution that would protect all shareholders and address some of the issues you pell raised”  stauner decl ex  at  the meeting failed to occur when pell insisted on having his attorney present  stauner and paulus told pell that the outside directors had not contemplated a meeting that included counsel  by email dated february   pell explained why he wanted his attorney present and reiterated his view that the legacyuroplasty directors were allied with killi dont like the  of us meeting  everytime sic you guys outnumber me i suffer  paul rachlin pells attorney or i will see you in court  im fed up with your bullshit  this board gave a  million dollar package to a ceo who was worth one th of that and the non binding sic vote by the stockholders said no your board was not aligned with the stockholders  and that proves it  my d is about to blow up  see you in court and on the front page of every minneapolis newspaperidi the february  and march  meetingsby letter dated february   pell demanded that the board reevaluate kills employment agreement and consider changes in the board  he proposed that the board form a special committee with stauner and wehrwein as its members to independently evaluate issues relating to the management team board structure and any transitionson february   in response to pells letter the outside directors held a special meeting  they continued discussing the clash between pell and kill and they considered pells demand for a special committee  they concluded thatthe appropriate governance process to address and consider mr pells requests was through the use of the boards existing committee structure  accordingly the board tasked the companys compensation committee to review managements compensation and possible succession planning and tasked the nominating committee to evaluate the boards composition and sizeroche decl ex  at by letter dated february   pell reiterated his demands  he also objected to the executive session conducted by the outside directors  he proposed again that the board form a special committee  in response the outside directors met again on march    they decided to stick with the approach they had agreed to on february   they anticipated that the committees would report to the full board at a meeting “to be scheduled at the end of march”  stauner aff ex d at j matters come to a headin early march  the threeway negotiations among pell kill and the outside directors resumed in earnest  pell made clear that in addition to terminating kill he also wanted roche and paulus off the boardroche and paulus were willing to consider resigning as part of a negotiated solution but they did not want to hand the company over to pell they wanted pell to drop his proxy contest enter into a standstill agreement and support three new independent directors who would replace roche paulus and kill they did not want to give pell any voice in selecting the three new directorsthe need to make decisions for the companys proxy statement ultimately forced the defendant directors to take action  with the annual meeting scheduled for may   the board had to decide whom the company would nominate  kill and roche sought to push off the board meeting until “as late as possible”  stuhlman aff ex  at  because of the timing requirements for filing the proxy statement however kill noticed the meeting for march   the meeting was later pushed back to march under its charter the nominating committee was charged with recommending candidates to the board  as part of its vetting process the nominating committee evaluated for potential renomination any class i directors whose terms were expiring as well as any new nominees that were suggested  by email dated february   roche contacted his fellow directors about possible candidates  he explained thatin the event that at any time a director desires not to be nominated for reelection and because it is prudent for a company to always have a list of potential candidates for director vacancies i would request that each of you forward to me a list of people you believe would be good possible directors for cogentix along with a brief background on the person  the nominating committee will then evaluate these potential candidates and maintain information on them in the event that vacancies arisestuhlman aff ex  at  roches email notably did not mention any plan to reduce the size of the boardin another email dated february   roche asked the three class i directors if they wished to be renominated and he solicited feedback from other members of the board about the class i directors performance  stauner emailed roche the next day stating “i do not want to be renominated for reelection to the board”  stuhlman aff ex  at  pell and zauberman responded that they wished to be renominated  roche aff ex j at on march   roche emailed pegus and paulus about a meeting of the nominating committee to be held on march   he identified the following agenda items consideration of renomination of lew pell consideration of renomination of howard zauberman discussion regarding the seat being vacated by jim stauner discussion re size of board discussion re separating ceo and chairperson rolesroche aff ex n at  roche did not provide further detail regarding the item about “size of board”in his march  email roche described the feedback he had received about pell and zaubermanin regard to lew pell one person praised his performance and recommended renomination  others commented on troublesome aspects of his performance but generally supported renomination due to his equity and debt position in the companyin regard to howard zauberman one person praised his performance and recommended renomination  the remainder noted issues with mr zaubermans performance and recommended he not be renominatedidevidencing his alignment with kill and opposition to pell paulus responded by inquiring about requiring directors to disclose any ties with pell he wrotegiven the proxy process we are currently managing is there any utility in reviewing our conflict of interest policy for good governance and for individual directors  i also wonder if we should ask each board member to complete a disclosure of any business financial or investment activities with lew pellid pegus wrote back observing that the disclosure should not “be focused on relationships with pell” but rather broadened to include any entanglements  stuhlman aff ex  at  paulus agreed and observed that “we will have to walk a careful line as we manage the proxy fight with one shareholder while considering the interests of the others”  id paulus thus recognized in writing what everyone had known since february   without a negotiated settlement a proxy fight was comingon march   the nominating committee held a telephonic meeting  roche presided as chair and paulus and pegus attended  the minutes recount that the members “voted two to one to recommend that the board nominate mr pell to serve as the sole director of class i of the board of directors”  roche aff ex q at  the members also “voted two to one to recommend that the board not nominate mr zauberman to serve as a class i director of the board and allow his term to expire at the  annual meeting of the stockholders”  id pegus was the dissenting vote  paulus dep the nominating committee members next turned to the issue of reducing the size of the board  according to the minutesmr roche led a discussion with the committee regarding the potential size of the board noting that the committee elected not to nominate mr zauberman and understood that james stauner was contemplating whether he would agree to stand for reelection and may resign effective as of the expiration of his term  the committee reflected on prior discussions relative to reducing the board size by two seats and the challenge of recruiting new members in compliance with the committee charter and policy prior to the annual meeting  a discussion took place during which mr roche responded to questions from committee members and the committee discussed the pros and cons of eliminating the two board seats form class i of the board of directors if mr stauner confirmed that he would not stand for reelection and would resign his seat in connection with the annual meeting of stockholdersid at  the nominating committee members “voted two to one to recommend that ․ in conjunction with the companys annual meeting the board be decreased to five sic members by decreasing class i of the board to one member and that the board nominate mr pell as the singular class i successor”  id the reference to “five  members” was either a typographical error or an anachronism that crept in when the minutes were drafted later  at the time reducing the board by two seats would have resulted in six members  the nominating committee did not decide to reduce the board to five seats until after wehrweins resignation which occurred three days lateralthough the record is not clear on this point it seems likely that pegus contacted zauberman and pell and reported on what had occurred at the meeting  by email dated march   zauberman wrote to kill asking “i hear rumors that you want me off the board  do i get to hear from you first or is it going to be a surprise”  stuhlman ex  at  kill respondedyou must not be familiar with how a public company board works  the nominating committee seeks input from all board members and they then meet to determine their recommendation to the full board  if any decision were to be made communication would come from those who made that decisionidkill nevertheless asked roche to talk with zauberman  on the morning of march   roche and zauberman had a call  afterwards zauberman sent an email to pell in which he reported on the conversationi spoke with kevin roche this morning․  he said that the nominating committee will be recommending the following reduce the board by  positions eliminating stauner and me  he stated that they believe this would make it easier to control the board and that they consider me biased towards pell renominate pell to the board leave kill with both the ceo and chairman role  only separate ceo from chairman roles should they negotiate a transition for and with kill and then hire a new ceostuhlman aff ex  at  formatting added  at least according to zauberman roche linked the board reduction plan to “control of the board”  k wehrwein resignswhile these events were transpiring wehrwein resigned from the board  on march   he sent an email only to kill stauner and roche in which he resigned effective immediately  wehrwein had served as the chair of audit committee and was designated as that committees financial expertkill informed the other directors of wehrweins resignation on march    kill wrote that “in speaking with wehrwein he said that he was ‘tapping out’ as he could no longer deal with the conflict within our board”  kill aff ex j at wehrweins resignation prompted roche to suggest reducing the size of the board to five  in an email dated march   roche shared his thoughts with paulus and pegus the other members of the nominating committeei would guess i speak for everyone when i say that i am extremely disappointed in wehrwein leaving in this critical time particularly because he is our audit committee chair and financial statement expert  i really dont understand it at all  as i try to process this in regard to our board decisions on tuesday and after talking to the attorney my thought is to simply now downsize the board by three seats  we can then take time to fully evaluate someone to replace wehrwein as the financial statement and audit expert evaluate the board candidate pell suggested and evaluate other potential candidates  there simply is not time now for us to do that evaluation properlyroche aff ex r at  pegus responded that she agreed with that plan  idthree days later in anticipation of a meeting of the board to be held the next day roche emailed paulus and pegus noting that “with the pace of events we havent had a chance to jointly discuss all the ramifications for governance but i wanted to give both of you the gist of what i will say tomorrow”  roche aff ex s at  his email included the following draft reportthe nominating committee was charged with examining board composition and other governance issues in addition to its annual tasks in regard to the proxy and shareholder meeting and with making recommendations on those issues and tasksthis process was complicated by wehrweins resignation and stauners indication that he likely would not stand for reelection․wehrweins resignation leaves us without an audit committee financial expert a serious concern that we need to address in  days under nasdaq rulesour ultimate goal is to try to rebuild a board that has the skills to effectively oversee the companys business and management for the benefit of all shareholders and that maximizes a perception of independence in performing those tasks and avoids persons who are perceived as having too close a tie to management or current directors or specific shareholders  we also should evaluate separating the ceo and chairperson roles in conjunction with the board rebuildingto do this effectively will take a careful thoughtful process that cannot and should not be hurried  the nominating committee has begun setting out that process which can include the use of an outside search firm to identify and evaluate candidates in accordance with the criteria and qualifications we set forth  our initial focus should be to identify the replacement audit committee financial expertin light of all the considerations and circumstances in which we find ourselves our recommendations some of which are standard ones relating to the annual proxy process include․ renominating lew pell as a class  director reducing the board immediately to seven members by eliminating the seat that was held by wehrwein and decreasing class ii to two members  reduce the board size to five effective at the shareholder meeting by decreasing class  to one member who would be lew pell and eliminating stauners and zaubermans seatsid to justify the board reduction plan roche thus cited the desire to enable the incumbent directors rather than the stockholders to “rebuild the board”  idafter reviewing roches email paulus endorsed the draft reportthis looks good to me  i support this approach and the items recommended  that said it is clear we have work to do to put the board back together again post downsizingstuhlman aff ex  at  paulus thus also linked the board reduction plan to the incumbent directors desire to “put the board back together” rather than having the stockholders decidealthough the record again is not clear it seems likely that pegus reported to zauberman and pell about what roche was proposing  on march   the next day pell sent another letter to the board and filed it publicly as an exhibit to his schedule d pell also provided the company with formal notice likewise dated march  that he intended to nominate himself zauberman and nonparty dr james dorta for election as class i directors  the notice included eight stockholder proposals to be addressed at the annual meeting  without commenting on the validity of any of the proposals they were• “amend section  of the bylaws and article xii section  of the charter to fix the size of the board at eleven  members”• “repeal each provision of amendment to the bylaws adopted by the board subsequent to july   which is the date of the last publicly available bylaws without the approval

march  meetingon march   the board met at the companys headquarters the “march  meeting”  kill paulus and roche attended in person  the other directors attended by telephonekill noted that the company had received pells letter nominating three individuals as class i directors and proposing items of business for the annual meeting  he also noted that “the primary purpose of the meeting was to discuss the reports and recommendations of the nominating committee and compensation committee ․ in response to mr pells previously expressed concerns regarding the companys management and board

demands with the ultimate goal of providing a board that adequately represented all stockholders” and that the committee also had conducted its “annual review of incumbent candidates for renomination to the board”  id at that point stauner confirmed that he did not intend to stand for reelection and “would resign his seat in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders and that his resignation would be effective that day”  id after noting that wehrwein had resigned roche reported that the committee made recommendations that included the followingthat the board size i be

conduct”  “delaware has three tiers of review for evaluating director decisionmaking  the business judgment rule enhanced scrutiny and entire fairness”  reis v hazelett strip–casting corp  ad   del ch  particularly during the s standards of review seemed to proliferate  the landmark decisions in unocal corp v mesa petroleum co  ad  del and revlon inc v macandrews  forbes hldgs inc  ad   del for example were perceived initially to be separate doctrines with the latter imposing affirmative conduct obligations on directors  over the ensuing decades delaware decisions have made clear that revlon does not impose conduct obligations but rather operates as a form of reasonableness review ie a manifestation of enhanced scrutiny it likewise seemed that chancellor allens famous decision in blasius industries inc v atlas corp  ad  del ch gave rise to a separate standard of review  since then the delaware supreme court has made clear that blasius is a form of enhanced scrutiny in which the compelling justification concept from that decision is applied “within the ․ enhanced standard of judicial review”   writing while serving on this court chief justice strine likewise explained the role of blasiuswithin the larger context of the intermediate standard of enhanced scrutiny the question of what causes enhanced scrutiny to serve as the operative standard of review is a different inquiry than what it takes to satisfy or fall short of the parameters of the test  stated generally enhanced scrutiny applies “where the realities of the decisionmaking context can subtly undermine the decisions of even independent and disinterested directors”   “inherent in these situations are subtle structural and situational conflicts that do not rise to a level sufficient to trigger entire fairness review but also do not comfortably permit expansive judicial deference”  normally directors who face a proxy context confront a structural and situational conflict because their own seats are at risk  “a candidate for office whether as an elected official or as a director of a corporation is likely to prefer to be elected rather than defeated  he therefore has a personal interest in the outcome of the election even if the interest is not financial and he seeks to serve from the best of motives”  aprahamian v hbo  co  ad   del ch  consequently “when the election machinery appears at least facially to have been manipulated those in charge of the election have the burden of persuasion to justify their actions”  id at enhanced scrutiny however is not limited to electoral contests where the entire board might be replaced  “enhanced scrutiny also applies in other situations where the law provides stockholders with a right to vote and the directors take action that intrudes on the space allotted for stockholder decisionmaking”  the most fundamental principles of corporate governance are a function of the allocation of power within a corporation between its stockholders and its board of directors  the stockholders power is the right to vote on specific matters in particular in an election of directors  the power of managing the corporate enterprise is vested in the shareholders duly elected representatives․maintaining a proper balance in the allocation of power between the stockholders right to elect directors and the board of directors right to manage the corporation is dependent upon the stockholders unimpeded right to vote effectively in an election of directorsliquid audio  ad at – footnotes omitted  the delaware supreme court and this court “have remained assiduous in carefully reviewing any board actions designed to interfere with or impede the effective exercise of corporate democracy by shareholders especially in an election of directors”  id at for enhanced scrutiny to apply the boards actions “need not actually prevent the shareholders from attaining any success in seating one or more nominees in a contested election for directors and the election contest need not involve a challenge for outright control of the board of directors”  id at   when there is director conduct “affecting either an election of directors or a vote touching on matters of corporate control” the board must justify its action under the enhanced scrutiny test  in this case both reasons for applying enhanced scrutiny existfirst the board reduction plan “affected ․ an election of directors”  mercier  ad at   before the board reduction plan stockholders would vote on three seats  after the board reduction plan stockholders will only vote on one seat  the board reduction plan therefore has a clear and obvious effect on the ability of the stockholders “to vote either contrary to the will of the incumbent board members generally or to replace the incumbent board members in a contested election”  liquid audio  ad at second the board reduction plan “touched on” matters of corporate control  before the board reduction plan control over cogentix was in play because the stockholders could elect a slate of three directors who together with the divided incumbents could form a new majority  after the board reduction plan control over cogentix was no longer in play  stockholders could only reelect one incumbent without affecting the composition of the board or the direction of the companyboth types of conduct are sufficiently suspect to warrant review under the enhanced scrutiny test  “of course the mere fact that the court uses a heightened reasonableness standard does not mean that the directors will fail to satisfy it”  sandridge  ad at   put differently determining whether enhanced scrutiny applies is different than determining whether enhanced scrutiny is met the parameters of enhanced scrutiny in the voting contextwhen tailored for reviewing director action that affects stockholder voting enhanced scrutiny requires that the defendant fiduciaries bear the burden of proving i that “their motivations were proper and not selfish” ii that they “did not preclude stockholders from exercising their right to vote or coerce them into voting a particular way” and iii that the directors actions “were reasonable in relation to their legitimate objective”  mercier  ad at –  “if for some reason the fit between means and ends is not reasonable the directors would also come up short”  id at the delaware supreme court has held that when the vote involves an election of directors or touches on matters of corporate control the directors justification must not only be “reasonable” but also “compelling”  liquid audio  ad at –  in this context the shift from “reasonable” to “compelling” requires that the directors establish a closer fit between means and ends  mercier  ad at   although linguistically reminiscent of the type of review given to suspect classifications under the federal constitution the use of the word “compelling” is not intended to signal that type of strict scrutiny  id instead it is a reminder for courts to approach directorial interventions that affect the stockholder franchise with a “gimlet eye”   it is also a reminder that in the context of voting rights there is one justification that the directors cannot use to justify their actions  they cannot argue that without their intervention the stockholders would vote erroneously out of ignorance or mistaken belief about what course of action is in their own interests i have assumed that the defendant directors motives were proper and not selfish  the enhanced scrutiny analysis therefore turns on the second and third aspects of the test  whether the directors precluded stockholders from exercising their right to vote or coerced them into voting in a particular way and whether the directors actions bore a sufficiently close relationship to a legitimate objective  mercier  ad at a preclusionit is reasonably probable that the defendant directors will not be able to establish at trial that the board reduction plan is not preclusive  “for a measure to be preclusive it must render a successful proxy contest realistically unattainable given the specific factual context”  versata enters inc v selectica inc  ad   delthe board reduction plan made success in a proxy contest realistically unattainable in two ways  first it eliminated the possibility of success for two seats  before the board reduction plan stockholders had the opportunity to elect three directors  after the board reduction plan they could elect only one director  by eliminating two seats the board made it impossible for stockholders to elect directors to those positions  by doing so the board imposed its favored outcome on the stockholders  no new directorsthe board reduction plan also made a successful proxy contest realistically unattainable because it prevented the stockholders from establishing a new majority  before the board reduction plan stockholders could establish a new board majority by electing three class i directors  after the board reduction plan that was no longer possible  once again the board imposed its favored outcome on the stockholders  no change in boardlevel controlthe factual record supports these findings and demonstrates that the defendant directors approved the board reduction plan to avoid a proxy fight that they feared pell would win  before wehrwein resigned they believed that pell could change the board governance dynamic from a fivetothree majority that favored the legacyuroplasty directors to a fourfour split  in his email to paulus dated february   kill proposed the board reduction plan noting that it “avoids any proxy fight”  stuhlman aff ex  at  later that day kill reiterated his support for the board reduction plan stressing that it would prevent pell from having any chance at “calling the shots”whats right is the board reduction plan then we temporarily upsize the board by two after the annual meeting ․ and we can then execute the orderly transition for you paulus me kill and roche without shareholder disruption  the bottom line is that pell cant be calling the shots ․ and he needs to know there are solutions not good for him if he isnt willing to play ballstuhlman aff ex  at  kill euphemistically referred to the ability of stockholders to elect three directors as “shareholder disruption”  id paulus agreed writing that “if pell wont agree to support the nominating committees candidates then i think we need to persuade stauner that the best option is to downsize the board—dont replace stauner if he leaves and eliminate zaubermans seat”  stuhlman aff ex  at  kill then reiterated the need for the board reduction plan stressing that “it will be a solid – after that and paulus and roche will still control the nominating committee”  stuhlman aff ex  at  emphasis added  this was an explicit reference to preserving board controlthe outcome might have been different if the directors had acted before pell sent the february  letter  see openwave sys inc v harbinger capital prs master fund i ltd  ad  – del ch applying business judgment rule to decision to reduce size of board to eliminate vacant seats where directors acted on a clear day with no proxy contest imminent  under the present circumstances pell has established a reasonable probability of showing successfully that the board reduction plan is preclusive  pell has therefore established a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits on a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under the enhanced scrutiny standardb adequate justificationassuming for the sake of argument that the board reduction plan was not viewed as preclusive there remains a reasonable likelihood that the defendant directors will not be able to establish at trial that the board reduction plan was a sufficiently tailored means to achieve a legitimate end  the defendant directors offered three justifications for the board reduction plan one is illegitimate  the other two were not sufficiently convincing to justify foreclosing a proxy contestthe defendant directors principal justification for the board reduction plan was framed in the draft report and recommendations of the nominating committee that roche circulated on march    during the board meeting on march  roche delivered his report and the defendant directors acted on it  the defendant directors themselves described the report as “crucial to understanding the thought process of the nominating committee and the board as a whole”  dkt  at in his report roche explained the followingour ultimate goal is to try to rebuild a board that has the skills to effectively oversee the companys business and management for the benefit of all shareholders and that maximizes a perception of independence in performing those tasks and avoids persons who are perceived as having too close a tie to management or current directors or specific shareholders․to do this effectively will take a careful thoughtful process that cannot and should not be hurried  the committee has begun setting out that process which can include the use of an outside search firm to identify and evaluate candidates in accordance with the criteria and qualifications we set forth  our initial focus should be to identify the replacement audit committee financial expertroche aff ex s at  he then recommended the board reduction plan which the defendant directors adoptedas the report demonstrates the defendant directors approved the board reduction plan so that they rather than the companys stockholders could determine who would serve on the board  in addition to the evidence in roches report the same purpose can be seen in other contemporaneous documents such asunfortunately for the defendant directors the belief that directors know better than stockholders is not a legitimate justification when the question involves who should serve on the board of a delaware corporation  “the notion that directors know better than the stockholders about who should be on the board is no justification at all”  mercier  ad at   accord blasius  ad at   “even a boards honest belief that its incumbency protects and advances the best interests of the stockholders is not a compelling justification  instead such action typically amounts to an unintentional violation of the duty of loyalty”  esopus creek value lp v hauf  ad   del ch footnote omittedthe defendant directors secondary justifications fare no better  during their testimony the defendant directors cited the cost savings from having fewer directors and the greater efficiency of a smaller board  although there are references in the record to these benefits they did not drive the board reduction plan they were embellished for purposes of litigation  cf mercier  ad at  explaining that enhanced scrutiny is “useful in exposing pretextual justifications”as with many litigation constructs the secondary justifications were built around grains of truth  the defendant directors testified that during  discussion took place about the possibility of reducing the size of the board from eight directors to six  the thought seems to have been that zauberman and stauner would leave but the concept was not fleshed out in detail and stauner does not recall anyone discussing his departure with him  see stauner dep –when the idea of the board reduction plan reemerged in february  however the concept was notanimated by a desire to reduce costs or make the board more efficient  with one minor exception the issue of costs did not appear at all in the internal communications among kill roche and paulus  they instead focused on preserving control and they discussed reupsizing the board after the annual meeting showing that cost was not a material factor to them  similarly they were prepared to keep the size of the board at seven if stauner had not wanted to leave and then at six until wehrwein resigned  if cost was the key consideration it should not have mattered who was departing  for kill roche and paulus however costs only were worth saving if it meant eliminating a legacyvsi seatreferences to costs also did not appear in roches report from the nominating committee on march  which provided the basis for the defendant directors actions  roche cited the need to “rebuild a board that has the skills to effectively oversee the companys business and management” and the desire to carry out that task through “a careful thoughtful process that cannot and should not be hurried”  roche aff ex s at  if anything his report implied that the board reduction plan was a temporary step and that the board would be increasing in size again after the annual meeting albeit with candidates chosen by the directors rather than the stockholdersgiven the absence of meaningful contemporaneous evidence supporting the costsavings justification it can be discounted as pretextual  even if valid the board reduction plan was not sufficiently tailored to that end  if cash had been the issue the directors could have found other solutions such as using options or restricted stock  paulus dep   the limited magnitude of the cost savings also did not justify the major step of eliminating stockholder choice  the total savings amounted to – per director which was “a small percentage” of cogentixs cash burn  stauner dep similar problems undermine the efficiency justification  the notion that a smaller board would be more efficient did not appear in the contemporaneous documents and it did not make sense either  the board dysfunction was driven by the animosity between pell and kill which forced the outside directors to choose sides  a smaller board would still have the same dynamic making the efficiency justification a non sequiturwithout legitimate and convincing justifications that are supported by the record the defendant directors resorted in their briefing to asking two rhetorical questions that they claimed have no answers  first they posited  “why if the director defendants had truly feared the loss of control through a proxy contest did they not act to fill the vacant wehrwein seat with another socalled ‘ally’ of kills”  dkt  at   the factual record suggests a rather obvious response  filling wehrweins seat neither solved the control problem if pell could run nominees for three seats nor mattered for the control problem if he couldnt  under the former scenario if the defendant directors filled wehrweins seat and pell won three seats in a proxy contest then boardlevel control was lost because pell could create deadlock with a –to– split  under the latter scenario if the defendant directors reduced the size of class i to a single seat then they would retain a –to– majority regardless  filling wehrweins seat would make it –to– but it would not change the outcome for purposes of boardlevel control  at the same time if the defendant directors also approved the board reduction plan as was necessary to protect their boardlevel control then filling wehrweins seat would undercut the justifications on which they hoped to rely  they could hardly claim that they reduced the size of the board to save costs and create a more efficient structure if at the same time they were filling an empty seat  from the standpoint of the defendant directors not filling wehrweins seat was good strategysecond the defendant directors asked “why if the conspiracy was to maintain or increase the socalled ‘kill ally’ influence on the board did the nominating committee and board choose to nominate pell himself rather than nominating one or more other socalled ‘kill allies to be elected on the managementsponsored class i slate”  dkt  at   the factual record again suggests an answer  the defendant directors did not have a reliable alternative candidate  one of the main reasons for adopting the board reduction plan strategy was to get past the annual meeting at which point the nominating committee could engage in a leisurely process to identify vet and select additional directors  when the time came to nominate candidates in march the defendant directors had a list of names and they had made some initial calls but they did not have individuals they felt they could count on  equally important as a tactical matter refusing to nominate pell would give him an issue for the proxy contest  he already was alleging that the other directors did not own enough equity and were insufficiently aligned with the interests of the stockholders  if the defendant directors left him out he could argue that it further evidenced the disconnect between the defendant directors and the stockholders because the defendant directors had decided not to renominate the director with the largest economic interest in the company  as with filling wehrweins seat not nominating pell also would undercut arguments the defendant directors hoped to make by drawing a sharper distinction between the two groups of legacy directors and reinforcing pells contention that the defendant directors were trying to retain board control  the smart move was to renominate pell which is what the defendant directors didultimately the defendant directors approved the board reduction plan because it enabled them to avoid a proxy contest for three seats that could shift control at the board level  their contemporaneous communications refer explicitly to the need to maintain control and the concomitant benefit of avoiding a proxy contest  i have assumed for purposes of analysis that the defendant directors sought to preserve their control for a selfless purpose namely to rebuild the board after the annual meeting with candidates that they identified vetted and selected  by doing so however the defendant directors sought to substitute their judgment for that of the stockholders which delaware law does not permitas with the preclusion analysis the outcome might have been different if the directors had acted on a clear day  under those circumstances justifications like cost savings or the superior dynamics of a smaller board might well have been sufficient  see openwave  ad at –  but in this case the defendant directors acted in the face of an anticipated proxy contest  “that defensive action by the defendant directors compromised the essential role of corporate democracy in maintaining the proper allocation of power between the shareholders and the board because that action was taken in the context of a contested election for successor directors”  liquid audio  ad at   the plaintiff once again has established a reasonable likelihood of success of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under the enhanced scrutiny standardb irreparable harmthe second requirement for a preliminary injunction is a threat of irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted  revlon  ad at   this requirement is metharm is irreparable unless “alternative legal redress is clearly available and is as practical and efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration as the remedy in equity”  t rowe price recovery fund lp v rubin  ad   del ch quotation marks and citations omitted  “courts have consistently found that corporate management subjects shareholders to irreparable harm by denying them the right to vote their shares”  telcom–sni invrs llc v sorrento

where as here any postmeeting adjudication might come too late”  packer v yampol  wl  at  del ch apr  absent an injunction the companys stockholders will be prevented from exercising their voting rights by electing three directors at the annual meeting  by preordaining the results of the annual meeting the board reduction plan deprives stockholders of their right to vote  “this loss of voting power constitutes irreparable injury” phillips v insituform of n am inc  wl  at  del ch aug   allen c  see third point llc v ruprecht  wl  at  del ch may   explaining that had the plaintiffs shown a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits “it also likely would have been able to demonstrate a threat of imminent irreparable harm due to its reduced likelihood of winning the election”c the balancing of the equitiesthe final element of the injunction standard is a balancing of the equitiesa court must be cautious that its injunctive order does not threaten more harm than good  that is a court in exercising its discretion to issue or deny such a ․ remedy must consider all of the foreseeable consequences of its order and balance them  it cannot in equity risk greater harm to defendants the public or other identified interests in granting the injunction than it seeks to preventlennane v ask computer sys inc  wl  at  del ch oct   allen c  here the balancing decidedly favors an injunction“the interests of corporate democracy on which stockholders rely have the greatest effect on the balance of the equities․”  sherwood v ngon  wl  at  del ch dec    “shareholder voting rights are sacrosanct  the fundamental governance right possessed by shareholders is the ability to vote for the directors the shareholder wants to oversee the firm”  emak worldwide inc v kurz  ad   del  “the harm threatened here is to the corporate electoral process a process which carries with it the right of shareholders to a meaningful exercise of their voting franchise and to a fair proxy contest with an informed electorate”  packer  wl  at conversely the defendant directors will face no hardship from an injunction  the risk that stockholders may elect directors whom the incumbents disfavor is no harm at all  even when the incumbents themselves could be voted out of office that fact does not support a claim of hardship  see aprahamian v hbo  co  ad   del ch “the incumbent directors have no vested right to continue to serve as directors and therefore will suffer no harm if they are defeated”d a limitation on the scope of the injunctionduring the injunction hearing the defendant directors argued that the court should distinguish between i the reduction in the size of the board from eight to seven which eliminated the vacancy in class ii created by wehrweins resignation and ii the reduction in the size of the board from seven to five which will become effective at the annual meeting and which also will reduce the number of class i seats from three to one  the defendant directors argued that any injunction should be limited to the second phasepell did not oppose the parsing of the board reduction plan in this fashion and the distinction does not appear harmful to stockholder interests  the class ii seat formerly held by wehrwein is not up for election at the annual meeting so eliminating it does not limit the stockholders ability to elect new directors  to the extent it has any effect on the composition of the board it reduces the number of seats held by the incumbents  that in turn increases the potential influence of any newly elected directors which enhances rather than impairs stockholders voting rights  if pell had shown that the stockholders could fill wehrweins vacancy at the annual meeting then the analysis would be differentconsequently as the defendant directors requested the preliminary injunction does not extend to the elimination of the class ii seat formerly held by wehrwein  pending further developments the board has seven seatsiii conclusionuntil this court renders a final decision on the merits the defendant directors are enjoined from completing the board reduction plan by reducing the number of seats from seven to five and fixing the number of class i seats at one  the board has seven seats with three allocated to class i two allocated to class ii and two allocated to class iiithis courts granting of a preliminary injunction does not intimate any view about the pending proxy contest  having reviewed the evidence in this case i am inclined to believe that the merits of pells platform and the strategic questions that have divided the board are matters on which reasonable minds could disagree  for good or ill the companys stockholders—not this court—have the right to elect the individuals who as members of the board will direct and oversee the business and affairs of the corporation  in re gulla  a   del ch  the preliminary injunction preserves their right to do that

not learn of the board reduction plan until the board meeting on march   when the plan was proposed to the board and approved  that was true in the sense that it was the first time pell received official notice  discovery established that pell received indications that the defendant directors were planning something along the lines of the board reduction plan soon after the march  meeting of the nominating committee and again from zauberman on march  and   the defendant directors claim that because pell heard rumors earlier about what the defendant directors were planning the complaint was false and pells theory materially discredited  see dkt  at – –  in my view pells account was materially accurate and the defendant directors protest too much on this point   chen v howard–anderson
