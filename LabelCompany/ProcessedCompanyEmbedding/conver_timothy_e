performance and highlight some of the important progress weve made teresa covington will review q financials and yeartodate results then ill discuss our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year before we take your questions our team continued to execute our strategy successfully and we delivered results in line with our full year plan q revenue of  million was slightly above q last year and slightly below our expectations for this year due to component part shortages the component issues have now been resolved for q shipments healthy customer funded rd revenue in q across multiple projects reflected continued customers interest in our advanced developments gross profit margin of  for the quarter was in line with expectations total revenue of  million for the first nine months of the year leaves  million to go to achieve the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance our team once again extended our market leadership in our core business during q in our ees business segment we introduced turbodock during the quarter this is a simpler lower cost solution for workplace charging that we believe can expand our ev charging footprint and will help support broader ev adoption turbodock leverages the unique size and dualvoltage design of our successful turbocord residential charging solution it adds a smartphone user interface and back office support to provide a compelling new solution for the workplace our charging station costs availability and access issues have slowed adoption todate in our uas business segment we began shipments of new wasp ae systems to the us marine corps in q this is the first contract to support the marines new small unmanned airplane system family requirement we also continued to successfully demonstrate shipboard applications of puma ae during the quarter broad and positive customer response continues to reinforce our expectation of significant navy and other maritime opportunities for our solutions we also continued to make progress on expanding from our core small uas business into next generation larger uas solutions were currently executing on phase ii of the contract for darpas tern program the goal of this program is to develop a new class of unmanned airplane system capable of long range and long duration operations from naval vessels such as destroyers that lack deck space for traditional aircraft operations we have an innovative and practical approach to delivering this capability and are working with a team of industry leaders to develop and demonstrate our system solution we anticipate a customer decision regarding the tern phase iii contract in our fiscal year  now turning to our international uas business you may recall that in  we signed a teaming agreement with dynamatic technologies to explore opportunities for our small uas in the indian market our persistent work together is beginning to yield positive results we were recently selected as the first of four pathfinder projects as part of the usindia defense technology transfer initiative this is a strategic initiative supported at the highest levels of both governments were working with dynamatic the us and the indian governments to finalize terms on a joint development and production program in india named cheel cheel is to be the next generation small uas based on our small uas leading market technology solutions and dynamatics cost effective aerospace capabilities the indian military is one of the worlds largest and has expressed requirements for small uas this programs initial objective is to provide a compelling and rapidly available solution for those procurement opportunities we will update you as we finalize details on this project and begin to move ahead beyond our activities in india we continue to see significant interest in our small uas solutions from allied military forces around the world international order flow timing tends to be more difficult to predict accurately but we expect multiple proposals to be decided on over the next few quarters in government fiscal  dod budget request was recently released and we found no significant surprises budget identified procurement line items have averaged only  of our actual dod bookings over the prior two years independent of the budget its important to note that the threat environment that drove the initial demand for both small uas and switchblade and then validated their compelling advantages does not seem to be abating now onto this years increased investments in three of our largest growth opportunities tactical missile systems global observer and commercial uas solutions the return on invested capital from adoption and success in these markets is compelling positioning for success in these opportunities is a key element of executing our growth strategy to build stockholder value we are increasing these investments because lead customers in each market continue to show increased interest in adoption were managing these investments with a metered and gaited approach to stay closely linked to customers and adoption timing these investments have mainly been on the income statement todate in the form of research and development and business development expense weve made significant progress yeartodate and we continue to strengthen our positions and build options for avs success when the adoption window opens for these transformational opportunities in tactical missile systems were investing in two key areas first the development of switchblade variants to address customer interest in additional concepts of operation second were developing the capability to demonstrate the compelling solution for an army program of record we are pleased to report that initial demonstrations of the first of three new switchblade variants exceeded customer expectations and we received followon customer funding early in q two additional switchblade variant programs for different customers are progressing well and are on schedule we continue to optimize switchblade for an army lmams program of record that would institutionalize the enduring requirement and the volume demand for multiyear procurement of sustainment a program of record continues to gain strong support within the us army we are also making incremental investments this year in global observer customers in other countries continue to express interest in global observer solutions and we have developed teaming relationships to optimally address each in turkey we are working through our joint venture altoy our memorandum of understanding with aselsan and others our memorandum of understanding with lockheed martin is focused on another opportunity set the timing of these potential opportunities remains uncertain but the need and the value of affordable seamless persistence is clear in commercial uas we successfully completed our first season of delivering advanced information services to bp in alaska we continue to work closely and collaboratively with bp to expand our services and to integrate into their regular operations it is important to note that bp has already added pipeline inspection to the scope of our services contract for calendar year  we are excited about bps success todate and the opportunities ahead our successful operations in alaska have led to significant increase in the faa authorized airspace for our commercial uas flight operations as a result we are now responding to multiple requests for proposal from new customers for our services in alaska we expect to expand further within and beyond alaska this year in the oil and gas industry in addition to the oil and gas industry and alaska we continue to support and work with early adopters of small uas for use in public safety applications we also are evaluating broad and high value applications in agriculture these and other industry specific solutions show great promise for delivering actionable information that can drive high returns on investment for adopting customers we were pleased to see the faa recently released proposed rules for the small uas operation first its important to understand that these are proposed rules and that the regulations that had been governing our industry remain in effect until new rules are implemented the public comment and review period may ultimately take many months at a minimum and potentially longer in the meantime we are aggressively expanding our commercial operations in alaska as i discussed earlier were also pursuing all other means for nearterm options for authorized commercial uas operations elsewhere in the united states we believe that preserving the safety of the national airspace system is vitally important and that the faa rules need to incorporate standards to ensure safety in uas operations av invests significant time and resources in developing testing and validating the underlying technologies and the integrated solutions that enable our systems to operate safely we have logged more than  million operating miles and we know very well what is required for safe operations we believe that many industries will come to depend on uas technologies in support of their mission critical operations and will necessarily seek safe professional grade solutions to do so further we believe that the right solutions are capable of safe operation beyond line of sight in the hands of trained and qualified operators the release of the proposed rules is a significant start to a discussion that we hope will lead to practical laws that enable the many industries organizations and the economy to benefit from these solutions while protecting our airspace and the people and property underneath it we have continued to expand our research and development capacity and we made progress in developments for tactical missile systems and commercial uas during the quarter however competition for rd resources from growing customer research and development contracts which we record as service revenue limited our total q internal rd to about flat quarteroverquarter we did accelerate our work to refine customer requirements define optimal solution sets and explore accelerated market access for these emerging new opportunities these investments are primarily reflected in our sga our yeartodate delay in internal research and development spending has not reduced our expected total investment rather it pushed that investment to the right in the meantime flat rd investment quarteroverquarter resulted in higher operating profit in the third quarter moderate success in any of these three growth opportunities can significantly enhance stockholder value good success in all three will be transformational for uav – for aerovironment with the overview of the quarter now id like to introduce teresa covington our interim cfo teresa joined aerovironment in  to lead finance for our ees business segment shes been a key member of

diluted share in the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis which excludes the impact of the cybaero investment eps would have been  per diluted share compared to  per diluted share in the same quarter last year we have provided an eps reconciliation table in the press release now moving quickly through our first nine months fiscal  results revenue for the first nine months of fiscal  was  million a decrease of  million or  as compared to  million in the prior year uas revenue decreased  million or  to  million primarily due to decreases in service revenue of  million and customer funded rd work of  million offset by higher product deliveries of  million ees revenue increased  million or  to  million primarily due to increased product deliveries of our industrial fast charge systems gross margin for the nine months was  million as compared to  million in the prior year this represents a decrease of  million or  gross margin was impacted by a government contract accounting reserve we set up in the second quarter for prior year incurred cost audit findings uas gross margin decreased  million or  to  million the decrease is primarily due to a termination settlement for a global observer technology demonstration contract that occurred during the first nine months of the prior year and lower service margins as a percentage of revenue gross margin for uas decreased from  to  ees gross margin increased  million or  to  million primarily due to higher sales volume as a percentage of revenue ees gross margin remained at  sga expense for the nine months was  million or  of revenue compared to sga expense of  million or  of revenue in the prior year rd investments for the nine months were  million or  of revenue compared to rd investments of  million or  of revenue in the prior year operating loss for the nine months was  million or negative  of revenue compared to operating income of  million or  of revenue last year other income for the nine months was  million compared to the prior year other expense of  million other income was higher primarily due to the prior year expense related to the conversion feature of our cybaero convertible notes investments the effective tax rate for the nine months was  compared to the effective tax benefit rate from prior year of  the net loss for the nine months was  million or  loss per share compared to the net income of  million or  per diluted share last year on an adjusted basis which excludes the impact of the cybaero investment eps would have been a  loss per share compared to earnings of  per diluted share in the prior year looking at backlog funded backlog at the end of the quarter was  million up  million or  from april   turning to our balance sheet cash equivalents and investments at the end of the third quarter totaled  million up  million from the prior quarter the increase in cash equivalents and investments was driven by lower working capital needs turning to receivables at the end of the third quarter our accounts receivable including unbilled receivables totaled  million up  million from the prior quarter total days sales outstanding was at approximately  days compared to  days at the end of the prior quarter taking a look at inventory inventories were  million at the end of the quarter compared to  million at the end of the prior quarter days in inventory were approximately  days compared to  days at the end of the prior quarter turning to capital expenditures in the third quarter we invested approximately  million or  of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment av recognized  million of depreciation in the quarter now an update to our fiscal  visibility as of today yeartodate third quarter revenues of  million third quarter ending backlog that we can execute in fiscal  of  million fourth quarter quartertodate bookings that we can execute in fiscal  of  million unfunded backlog that we expect to recognize in fiscal  of  million and revenues needed to hold ees revenues flat relative to last year of  million this puts the total fiscal  revenue visibility at  million or  of the midpoint of guidance this implies fourth quarter revenue of  billion now id like to turn things back to tim to discuss avs expectations for the balance of fiscal  timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks teresa we guided on revenue and gross profit margin this year to maintain visibility on our core business operations because planned rd and sga investments could consume more operating profit we remain on track for our fiscal  annual revenue and gross profit margin guidance we plan to significantly increase our fiscal  growth opportunity investments this quarter including a target to increase ird by more than  over q our visibility gives us confidence in our fiscal  guidance of  million to  million in revenue strong q gross profit and our q outlook support our gross profit margin guidance of  to  in q the primary focus of new bookings in on building backlog for fiscal  revenue looking ahead our funded backlog and our new order pipeline remain strong our increased investments this year are positioning us well for market opportunities that can drive significant stockholder value we will continue to closely monitor and adjust these investments based on customer adoption behavior timing and projected returns on investment capital were actively engaged in the planning process for fiscal  and were excited about the opportunities ahead we look forward to providing you with our views on the coming year in our q earnings release before we close the call and open it for qa i want to recognize our employees for their hard work every day that has extended avs position as a market leader across our business segments and our product lines while at the same time positioning av for leadership in exciting new markets with compelling innovations this team is the best in the world at what they do thank you for your interest and now well take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you the first question is from michael ciarmoli of keybanc your line is open kevin ciabattoni  keybanc capital markets inc hi good afternoon guys this is actually kevin on for mike just wondering if you could give us any color on the – additional color i guess on the tern program and now that the first downselect is complete what the companys working on there to get ready for the next downselect and whether youre still expecting that to occur in the next nine months or so i think last quarter youd said give or take  months kind of where that stands now timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer sure kevin tern is the – a darpa program thats intended to be a nextgeneration unmanned airplane system its a shipbased vertical takeoff and landing mediumaltitude longendurance platform five companies competed during phase i that was downselected to two companies currently competing in phase ii we do expect phase iii to be awarded during our fiscal year  were working on an innovative approach that we believe represents a high value and highly reliable means of achieving the darpa objectives we have a broad team of industry experts collaborating with us in developing and demonstrating this system design that our team has developed and we think this puts us in a strong position for nextgeneration larger uas solutions that ive said before is a priority for us kevin ciabattoni  keybanc capital markets inc okay thanks tim and then just looking at the rd line any color you can give us there in terms of how the mix has changed over the past quarter or so and kind of where you see it going in q as it relates to specific programs or markets timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer well our rd i think of it as being divided into three sections were running internallyfunded rd to support our core businesses we are investing incrementally in internallyfunded rd to position ourselves for these three large emerging markets that we see adoption activity increasing within customers and we conduct customerfunded research and development and what – weve been building our rd capacity significantly through the year we knew we planned on incrementally increasing the investments for these growth opportunities that capacity growth is both in terms of internal resources and developing additional external relationships that can execute rd in conjunction with us during q we had a significant increase in customerfunded research and development activities that competes directly with the same resources that we apply to our internal projects and so the balance of rd that was allocated to the core business and rd that was allocated to our growth opportunities accounted for the – a flat internallyfunded rd quarteroverquarter we expect to significantly increase our rd in q and our target as i mentioned in my call is to increase internally funded rd by over  this is still a delicate dance between allocation of scarce resources to multiple highpriority activities but we think were getting our capacity where we need it and were moving ahead with that intent operator thank you and the next question is from tyler hojo of sidoti  company your line is open tyler e hojo  sidoti  co llc yeah hi thanks for taking the question i guess the first one just on tim you mentioned kind of multiple rfps coming in just kind of similar to what youre doing with bp in alaska i was hoping that maybe you could just maybe just talk about the size of this nearterm opportunity and also what the competitive dynamic looks like i mean how many people do you think kind of offer a similar sort of offering or maybe just generally competing for the same work you are timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer let me maybe address the competitive issue first tyler and then try to talk about the size of the operations when bp put out rfps for the services that they were interested in previously they had multiple responses from many different types of organizations including multiple uav suppliers in the final analysis we were selected for all of the services exclusively i think that goes to – that says a lot about a sophisticated organization doing an informed analysis of available capabilities and matching them to the needs of the organization we continue to see multiple other companies primarily companies with quadcopter capability in the commercial space theyre clearly great fun to fly they produce wonderful video theyre carrying an increasing number of other payloads but i think we find that large enterprises that are looking at integrating this capability into the core part of their operations are looking for reliable safe professional solutions that can operate not just when its a pleasant day outside but when their operations require it and as a result weve been extremely successful in competing in those environments as to the size of the operation the number of opportunities are growing dramatically dramatically we started with one customer in alaska so but theyre growing by quite a bit based on the success in the first year i still dont expect that to transition into meaningful revenue contributions yet this year were still – in each one of these new organizations well be working with them for the first time as they evaluate how they integrate this capability into their operation as i mentioned in my call earlier bp is moving forward to add new services and to overtly move to integrate these services into regular operations and i think thats very positive and it supports our view that theres significant economic return for customers that adopt this capability tyler e hojo  sidoti  co llc okay great thanks tim and just a second question if i may just on the rd line of questioning earlier could you maybe just talk a little bit about how early on or where you think you are in this kind of development spending curve is it early should we kind of expect kind of elevated levels to persist for some time just some general comments there would be helpful timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer well if you recall when we initiated our plan for fiscal  and announced our intent to make significant investments in rd and in sga to position ourselves for these three emerging markets the majority of our investments was anticipated to be in research and development for the new solutions optimized for these applications and that is turning out to be the case most of our investments are in rd and a lesser amount in sga were behind our plan yeartodate in our rd investments were trying to play catch up in q to the extent that we dont complete all of the rd investments that we had planned for fiscal  and they continue – as they look right now they continue to look like they are necessary and appropriate for optimally positioning for these opportunities then well probably move that incremental amount into the first part of  beyond what we had planned for  itll – i think the situation will remain open for analysis and reaction to what customers decide to do and what the timing of adoption looks like as it evolves its a constantlymoving target and when and if we see the acceleration of adoption that would call for increased investment to maximize the stockholder returns that we can get from capturing a market position there well clearly look seriously at that but that will be sometime in  and we may or may not know anymore as we talk about our plan for  when we present that to you next call operator thank you and the next question is from josephine millward of benchmark company your line is open josephine l millward  the benchmark co llc hi tim timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer hello josephine josephine l millward  the benchmark co llc tim given the limited visibility you have on the fiscal year  budget requests what do you see as the biggest drivers for av in the coming year is it international is it the switchblade and do you expect the dod to continue to upgrade those small uas fleet timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer i think the answer to all three of those questions will be yes josephine our pipeline and our activities in international business development indicate strong and growing demand as i mentioned in my comments the timing of contract processing for international orders is a little more difficult to be accurate about but clearly the pipeline is there and we think that will continue to grow interest and demand for switchblade is increasing we have obvious constraints in the budget and its a new program that needs to get adjudicated across theaters but i think the demand for switchblade itself the strong interest in the variants that were developing for switchblade and the growing support within the army for a program of record for lmams are all positive indicators for future demand as to the small uas that you mentioned i think the sustainment activities are likely to continue there are other programs that appear to be driving upgrade demands in small uas across dod and we have the new cpds in both the army and the marine corps for the family of small uas that we think although we dont know the specific timing of that we expect to continue to see that to generating demand for puma ae wasp ae and others in the future josephine l millward  the benchmark co llc tim a followup on that can you expand on this usindia technology transfer initiative it seems like the indian papers are talking about joint production of the raven perhaps later this year and a multibillion dollar pipeline can you give us a little more on that timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah ill mostly reiterate the comments i made during my previous comments and if that isnt adequate then ill follow up later this is a strategic initiative between the governments of the united states and india thats a joint defense technology transfer agreement and this project for small uas is the first pathfinder project along the way of what is anticipated to be a broad and growing defense technology agreement the initial intent of this project is for aerovironment and our partner dynamatics that we signed an mou with in  for the purpose of pursuing small uas in india and for the two companies to do a joint development and production program of a nextgeneration small unmanned airplane system were applying all of our technology and knowhow to this program and our – dynamatics will apply their technology their knowhow and their extensive aerospace manufacturing capability within india as we jointly develop this and then produce this in india the initial intent of that production capability of this new design will be to address what we believe is a large demand within the indian government theres i believe something like  brigades in the indian army which is one of the largest in the world plus other police requirements so the potential requirement is quite large the interest at the highest levels of the government seems to be real and on point so were in the process now of working with dynamatics with the us government and with the indian government to finalize the terms of how we would structure this agreement and how we would move forward and as we get that finalized and begin actually moving then well report more to you operator thank you the next question is from troy jensen of piper your line is open troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker hey yeah thanks for taking my question hey tim just to put some numbers behind those rd comments so  million in the january quarter should go to  million im assuming theres no externally funded rd to offset that timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer thats our target and you could hopefully hear me hedging that a little bit thats what we want to do thats what were planning on doing and we have ongoing competition with our customerfunded rd to accomplish it with the same resources but that looks like an achievable plan at this early point in the quarter troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker okay understood and then on the rd spend are you guys doing any development in data analytics outside of capturing video just to process and interpret what the camera sees  timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer excuse me i missed the first part of the question troy could you try that again troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker yeah just on the rd spending is any of it going towards data analytics timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer oh yes yep in terms of the rd thats being applied towards our growth opportunities it includes uav platforms payloads and the data analytics associated with much of the actionable intelligence intent of our commercial solution troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker all right understood last question and ill cede the floor with the proposed rules for uavs just curious to know if you think that the line of sight theres going to be any type of constraints to growth here timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer well to the extent that the existing constraint on line of sight stays in place it does clearly limit the potential benefit that customers can achieve from these solutions as i mentioned in my comments we believe that a properlydefined solution with properly trained and certified operators can safely operate beyond line of sight and i think theres probably room for ongoing discussion with this clearly the faas intent is safety in the national air space and there are huge potential economic benefits to optimizing these solutions so well continue to work with the faa and with our providing optimized design solutions to maximize safety in that environment operator thank you the next question is from greg konrad of jefferies your line is open greg konrad  jefferies llc good evening i just wanted to go back to commercial uavs it seems like youre making some progress with bp and you mentioned that you had a bunch of other rfps out there so obviously without blanket rules in place you have some flexibility to kind of go after commercial business when these rules finally do get in place what are kind of the biggest markets that open up after versus kind of some of the things you can do on a oneoff basis today timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer well weve been focusing as weve described primarily on large industrial markets that by nature are global oil and gas for example agriculture for example both of those appear at this point to offer very large global opportunities and in both cases the use of unmanned aircraft to capture digital data process that data to generate concise actionable information that significantly improves the safety and the economics of the operation of the enterprise and as a result delivers significant return on investment to the extent that that continues to be validated as we roll out these solutions with those and other industries like that then these large projections of economic activity associated with commercial uas seem quite plausible to me greg konrad  jefferies llc and then just to go back to electric vehicle charging have you seen any impact in the business from gas prices i know theyve obviously been fairly volatile and then just kind of the followup to that over the past three years youve announced a number of kind of preferred relationships with different models of electric vehicle what type of take rate are you seeing on that to help us kind of correlate sales of these vehicles kind of with avav products timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer well weve had quite a difficulty in getting an accurate tie with ev sales and our attach rate because the mechanism for selling the chargers is not directly with the car but consumers make their decision for charging infrastructure independent and they make it in – with – not necessarily in the same timeframe so i dont have an accurate answer for our attach rate with you we have clearly seen a decline in the last couple of months in the sale of plugin electric vehicles its very early and its hard to make a – determine what the correlation is with the price of gasoline but one would suspect that higher gas prices would motivate higher ev sales but i think it will be a few more months at the minimum before anyone makes an informed correlation decision there operator thank you the next question is from michael ciarmoli of keybanc your line is open kevin ciabattoni  keybanc capital markets inc hi good evening again kevin just a quick followup tim just wondering what drove the increase in customerfunded rd in the quarter was it – it seems like it was unexpected and im just wondering what kind of drove that timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer well i dont think it was necessarily unexpected kevin but there are multiple projects being funded by customers most of which i will leave for the customers to announce the nature of customerfunded rd often can be sensitive competitive information although the largest piece of that is the tern program kevin ciabattoni  keybanc capital markets inc okay great thanks thats all i have operator thank you the next question is from joe denardi of stifel your line is open joe w denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey good evening tim im wondering if you could talk about given some of the issues or maybe the headwinds youre having with the ees business does that business still make sense to have within aerovironment maybe what are some of the synergies that flow through to the uav business and do you see that as an impediment to a potential acquirer not necessarily wanting the ees business timothy e conver  chairman president  chief executive officer joe weve got three product lines within ees we have a leading market share position in each of those currently the ev test product line is in decline thats kind of a poststimulus environment of overcapacity generated by the stimulus and it hasnt really grown back yet the electric vehicle industrial charging market is actually a growth opportunity of electric forklifts and other ev vehicles are continuing to gain share over ic engines and we do have a strong position in north america in charging infrastructure for plugin electric vehicles thats not yet a significant revenue generator but it has the potential to be very significant if and when the adoption rate of plugin vehicles reaches even singledigit penetration in the overall car market we dont expect thats likely to happen within the next few years or we do expect it will happen maybe within three years to five years overall we have – we think given the strong position we have and the potential growth in those markets its a good option to have in the enterprise there is a lot of synergy in the underlying technology both businesses are essentially focused on electric vehicles and much of the core technology in electric vehicles resides in our ees system and we leverage the same kind of production and program management and strategic practices and systems across both in general the – owning and managing the ees segment has not been a diversion from the other growth opportunities in the uas system and weve always felt that if and when that happens then we would reassess this joe w denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thanks tim operator thank you there are no further questions at this time ill turn the

from tim conver tim timothy e conver thank you steve the aerovironment team made great progress on our business objectives in fiscal  our results are best summarized by the two following achievements first our strong core business delivered the revenue we expected and exceeded expectations for profitability second our growth portfolio advanced through careful strategic investments that improved our position for large new market opportunities more broadly we strengthened our market leadership positions moved key programs forward to generate longterm value reinforced our strategic plan and continue to extend our track record of successfully driving innovation today ill summarize our fiscal  by first reviewing our financial performance and achievements during the quarter and the year and then discussing our operating performance in our core business and in our growth portfolio teresa covington will provide a detailed overview of our financials before our share  our outlook and goals for fiscal  and then we will take your questions now our financial results our fourth quarter revenue was  million an  yearoveryear increase gross margin in the quarter increased by  yearoveryear and fully diluted earnings per share were  our fiscal year  revenue of  million was just about at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range of  million to  million and was up  yearoveryear gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year was  well above our guidance range of  to  we are pleased to report that even after making the incremental investments we plan for the year the strong gross margin produced an operating profit of  million which translates to fully diluted eps of  total cash equivalents and investments increased by over  million up  yearoveryear ending funded backlog was  million compared to  million to prior year in our core business we reported another year of revenue in line with projected growth targets and our team delivered strong gross profits briefly i’d like to provide additional context to the accounting restatement referenced in our press release this matter related to accounting for amortization of the premium of heldtomaturity bonds and had no impact on our balance sheet income statement or on net cash flow teresa will provide more details in her prepared remarks now let’s review our operating performance in fiscal  starting with our efficient energy system segment or ees where we maintained market leadership positions in all three product lines electric vehicle or ev test systems industrial ev charging solutions and passenger ev charging solutions in our ev test system product line we introduced the next generation of smart ev test systems last september with the av ex capable of more varied and accurate testing and scalable from  kilowatts to more than  megawatt we believe our current and prospective customers will embrace this new capability and the ev testings market in our industrial ev charging business we continue to serve our customers in airports vehicle manufacturing distribution consumer goods and industrial product markets while engaging with new global enterprise customers for potential expansion we expect industrial evs to continue to gain market share from fossil fuel vehicles in passenger ev charging solutions we’ve deployed nearly  level  charge docks throughout north america we’ve significantly differentiated our market leading technology with our portable turbocord dual voltage charging system which we launched in january of  at the beginning of our fiscal  volvo became the first automaker to include turbocord as standard equipment with the delivery of its plug in vehicles this important development highlights turbocord’s value in a global oem solution and establishes an important new distribution channel for us we hope to secure additional turbocord in the trunk oem adoption this january we introduced turbodock level  workplace charging system with bluetooth connectivity turbodock provides access control charging at lower cost than celluarbased networks we see great potential for growth in the workplace and commercial market segments with this product and now let’s turn to operating performance in our unmanned aircraft system segment where we focus on global defense in commercial markets with unmanned airplane systems or uas tactical missile systems large uas and commercial uas i will update you on each of these areas separately starting with small uas in our core small uas business we remain the market leader with the largest installed base in the global defense industry in a very active development portfolio our battle proven puma became the first small uas approved by the faa for commercial operations demonstrating how our core technology delivers value across defense and commercial markets aerovironment developed and introduce the concept of a family of small uas with differentiated platforms optimized for different missions and interoperable with the common ground control system data link user interface training support and all environment capabilities all environment reference to the unique capability of these airplanes to regularly land in salt water in addition to landing on the ground and is designated by the suffix ae this family of small uas is unique to aerovironment and is another growing differentiator for our solutions last year the army and the marine corps each defined their next generation small uas requirements as a family of systems and both are built almost entirely around aerovironment solutions the army defined a new micro uas as part of its system requirements and our shrike vertical take off and landing or vtol solution is well positioned for that requirement when the army decides to initiate a procurement in fiscal  we’ve supported the army’s large installed base of raven and puma systems with sustainment orders and performance improvements upgrades we expect sustainment revenue for maintaining and upgrading our large and growing fleet of systems supplied across all military services to continue to be an important ongoing component of our business the marine corps began procurement of their new small uas requirements with wasp ae systems in fiscal ’  fiscal  and is evaluating additional puma ae procurement the us navy shows great potential as the next market to begin adoption of small uas our allenvironment and enhanced ship deck landing capability are unique and compelling for navy applications in fact the navy recently conducted successful evaluations of our puma ae and procured their first systems international demand for small uas continues to grow with multiple acquisition programs moving forward on independent but hard to predict timelines for example the australian defense force recently began training on its new wasp ae systems these international programs include significant opportunities emerging in india with our dynamatics mou and in turkey with our altoy joint venture we remain in a strong position to fulfill established and emerging needs for small uas to support united states and allied forces as well as any urgent needs that may develop in an increasingly uncertain world and now i will discuss our fiscal  investments and how they improved our competitive position across the three areas within our growth portfolio innovation is at the core of our business model and strategic investments will position aerovironment for continued success and value creation during fiscal  we invested  million in internal research and development or rd each about  million of that amount or  of revenue was used to support our core business and the additional  million was strategic investment into our growth portfolio in addition we spend  million performing customer funded rd for a total of  million in research and development invested primarily in uas and tactical missile system technology we think our investment in new uas solutions and our deep understanding of the industry represents a strategic advantage in the race to deliver next generation solutions to customers build market leadership and deliver return on invested capital we said at the beginning of last year investments throughout fiscal  in tactical missile systems global observer and commercial uas would position aerovironment to lead when adoption accelerates and would generate significant value in the near and longterm and we continue to believe that these investments yielded the intended results to better position us for the specific tactical missile systems and global observer adoption opportunities that we can now continue to pursue within our normal incremental investments  within our normal and without incremental investments building out enterprise solutions for large commercial market uas adoption however will require continued investment this year in tactical missile systems we have been delivering switchblade systems and generating revenue from hardware sales customer support and rd for the last few years we applied incremental fiscal  investment to develop and demonstrate new switchblade variants that customers have requested as a result of seeing switchblades unique capabilities these variants have now demonstrated and been deployed from ground air and sea platforms additionally we prepared for a pending army program of record for lmams by developing advanced capabilities for switchblade we did develop three separate customer funded switchblade variants in fiscal  and all demonstrations met or exceeded customer expectations we cofunded these developments with aerovironment rd investment as i outlined earlier which proved essential in successfully driving all three opportunities forward as a direct result of these successes to date we are confident that at least one of these variants will produce significant product revenue in fiscal  we expect the other two likely will receive additional customer funding to proceed in fiscal  we are optimistic that continued success in these programs will accelerate adoption of a family of tactical missile systems and drive significant revenue growth a program objective memorandum or pom is the recommendation of an armed service on how they plan to allocate resources for a program over the next five year planning cycle we believe the lmams program of record has not yet been included in the army fiscal ’ pom which will likely move a start of that program of record out by one or two years however we think this can actually have a positive outcome for us it provides the opportunity for switchblade as the only deployed solution to continue satisfying multiple procurement opportunities prior to program of record last year we combined our global observer solution for high altitude long endurance or hale uas and our current solution for medium altitude long endurance or male uas to form our large uas business area our strategic investments in fiscal  ensured we are well positioned for both global observer and current phase iii opportunities and we anticipate the ongoing pursuit of programs in both categories in our fiscal  base plan we remain engaged in active teaming and mou agreements and customer discussions for global observer adoption by allied governments tern represents the next generation category of male uas for operation from small naval vessels we with our industry leading partners remained focused on executing our phase ii tern program with darpa we are committed to delivering the most capable and effective solution and competing to secure an anticipated phase iii contract later this year our third area of strategic investment in fiscal  was in developing a new business in commercial uas here we are developing both hardware and software solutions to deliver powerful insights on demand that will support confident decision making for improved enterprise performance our investments in commercial uas include pilot

fourth quarter results are as follows revenue for the fourth quarter was  million an increase of  million or  as compared to  million a year ago looking at revenue by segment uas revenue was  million an increase of  million or  compared to last year the increase was primarily due to higher product deliveries of  million higher customer funded rd work of  million offset with lower service revenue of  million ees revenue decreased  million or  to  million in the fourth quarter this decrease was primarily due to lower product deliveries of our industrial ev charging solutions turning to gross margin gross margin for the fourth quarter was  million an increase of  million as compared to  million in the prior year by segment uas gross margin increased  million or  to  million in the quarter the increase was primarily due to favorable product mix as a percentage of revenue gross margin for uas increased from  to  ees gross margin decreased  million or  to  million in the quarter primarily

backlog funded backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was  million down  million or  from april   turning to our balance sheet cash equivalents and investments at the end of the fourth quarter totaled  million up  million from the prior quarter the increase in cash equivalents and investments was driven by lower working capital needs and higher income turning to receivables at the end of the fourth quarter our accounts receivable including unbilled receivables totaled  million up  million from the prior quarter total days sales outstanding was at approximately  days compared to  days at the end of the prior quarter taking a look at inventory inventories were  million at the end of the quarter compared to  million at the end of the prior quarter days in inventory were approximately  days compared to  days at the end of the prior quarter turning to capital expenditures in the fourth quarter we invested approximately  million or  of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment av recognized  million of depreciation in the quarter for the fullyear we invested approximately  million or  of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment and recognized  million of depreciation and amortization during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended april   we identified a presentation error in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended april   and  and for the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended april   the amortization of premiums related to heldtomaturity investments was presented within the investing activity section rather than the operating activity section of our consolidated statements of cash flows we corrected the error by restating those prior financial statements in the notes included in our form k for the year ended april   the error did not impact our consolidated balance sheet consolidated income statements or the overall change in cash flow for any of those periods now an update to our fiscal ’ visibility as of today we have fourth quarter ending backlog that we can execute in fiscal ’ of  million we had various orders we’ve booked to date in the first quarter of  million incremental revenues to hold ees revenues flat yearoveryear  million and finally the balance of the government fiscal  that we have not booked yet of  million this adds up to  million or  at midpoint of revenue guidance now id like to turn things back to tim to discuss avs expectations for fiscal ’ timothy e conver thank you teresa we’ve a strong position in our core small uas and efficient energy systems business as demonstrated by our leading market share and ongoing competitive success the core business has strong profitability as evidenced by our gross profit and the markets for both segments suggest longterm growth trends we anticipate singledigit growth in our core business this fiscal year and continued opportunity for longterm growth but our growth strategy for av goes far beyond our core business in our growth portfolio our  incremental investments solidified the positions we’ve been building to compete for and capture identified tactical missile systems global observer and male uas opportunities we expect contract decisions on each of these opportunities are likely to be decided over the next  months each of these three opportunities represents initial adoption into potential billion dollar markets with the strong positions we’ve established last year we can fund the ongoing pursuit of these new significant opportunities as well as support growth in our core business without incremental ird and sga spending levels this year building the strong position we want in the very large commercial uas market opportunity that we believe is emerging will require incremental investment in both ird and sga this year we intend to invest this year to develop enterprise solutions for global vertical markets including energy and agriculture and an innovative commercial small uas thirdparty forecasters project billion dollar market growth in commercial uas our potential return on investment could be very large with success in this opportunity but we will need to invest prudently now or risk missing a wave of adoption these incremental investments in commercial uas market solutions could offset much of the operating profit our core business would otherwise generate this year resulting reduced or possibly no operating profit in fiscal  as a result we will guide profitability for fy at a gross profit margin level with that background we expect fiscal  revenue of between  million and  million and gross profit margin between  and  we will maintain focus and visibility on the underlying gross profit competitive effectiveness and revenue growth of our core business throughout fy while we pursue key new opportunities in tactical missile systems and large uas we will prudently manage gated investment decisions to develop winning solutions for our new commercial uas business we see a future full of opportunities to drive shareholder value through success in these new markets we built our core business by developing innovative new solutions and we’re familiar with the process of new market adoption we will remain constructively engaged with lead adopting customers which positions us to make informed decisions on investments in order to be first to market with the right solution as new opportunities develop in these dynamic emerging markets we will continue to be guided by optimizing our return on invested capital and maximizing shareholder value there are numerous specifics regarding our innovative solutions for these new opportunities that we cannot discuss in order to maintain a competitive advantage or because of customer confidentiality agreements to the extend that these constrains ease in the future we will share these bold and innovative solutions with you across our business our technology solutions are designed to bring our current and our future customers the confidence to proceed in the complex and uncertain world in which they operate others have recognized our performance with aviation week selecting us as the top performing company in the  million to  billion revenue category this recognition reflects the quality and the performance of our people from design engineering to production from procurement to sales our people strive everyday to do whats right for our customers and our shareholders as always thank you to the members of the aerovironment team whose creativity passion and grip turns bold ideas into compelling value propositions for our customer’s to those customers who place their trust in us and to you on this call for your interest in aerovironment teresa and i will now take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of andrea james with dougherty  company your line is now open please go ahead andrea james hi guys thanks so much for taking my questions can you touch upon … timothy e conver hi andrea andrea james hi you touched upon this in your opening remarks so i was hoping if you could go a bit deeper you said you’re expecting single digit growth in your core business and i guess that accounts for all of the guidance so i just want to make sure it does the fy ’ guidance imply any recognized revenue growth against switchblade commercial uas or global observer timothy e conver well andrea i think i mentioned in the prepared remarks are observed that we have been delivering revenue from switchblade programs for the last few years that’s a combination of hardware deliveries customer funded rd and services so certainly ongoing revenue from switchblade in fact probably growing revenue from switchblade this year in terms of global observer we don’t have global observer revenue built into our core plan i did mention that we expect the first opportunity for a contract decision on global observer from a foreign government within the next  months back to predicting the timing of adoption of innovation being difficult andrea james okay and then i guess i’ll just throw this out there because it was in the news this week do you have any thoughts on the board structure in light of the activist letter that kind of made the rounds timothy e conver well we haven’t responded to that letter at this point as always we continue to welcome open communication with all of our shareholders and we value the input that is particularly direct towards enhancing shareholder value so we’ll continue to make all of our decisions around the business from a management and a board level with the focus on strong corporate governance and maximizing shareholder value andrea james thank you i’ll hop back in the queue operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of troy jensen with piper your line is now open please go ahead troy jensen hi congrats on the nice quarter and the margins timothy e conver thank you troy jensen just to followup a little bit on the commercial opportunities here do you think you’d be selling military quality uavs in the commercial applications or do you plan on like a new line of hardware to get into the commercial space or will you guys entrance be more on the services side like you’re doing with bp timothy e conver we have a primary focus on enterprise solutions that would address large global vertical markets like energy like agriculture and our experience to date has brought us down to a business model that we’re developing that would comprise capturing data from small unmanned aircraft and that amounts to specific and sometime specialized payloads on small uas platforms that we think will be optimized for these enterprise solutions in industrial markets so probably a long way of saying that our target solution would be built around platforms that would be optimized for commercial applications rather than military applications troy jensen right timothy e conver beyond that collection of course we’ve got a lot of data analytics and software presentation capability to close the loop on an actionable information enterprise solution the entry into our engagement with commercial customers however has been based on applying our previously developed and proven small uas from the military and puma being the first faa certified small uas for commercial applications has been a great help in working with bp and others in that area troy jensen and so if i could followup with a couple of questions for teresa here mainly on the model and mainly on the expense side i understand you kind of talked about the investments maybe offsetting the operating profits but if we just look at the rd i mean it was up significantly here in april quarter how do we think about modeling that on a quarterly basis through  and you maybe touched on sga it spiked up a bit here does it grow from this level or was there some onetime stuff in the fiscal fourth quarter timothy e conver the rd in q was abnormally high from our prior run rate and is not a level that we expect to maintain going forward we were closing out a year of incremental investment to position ourselves in these new markets and we got off to a bit of a late start and a strong finish troy jensen but i guess i was wanting teresa  or for teresa specifically that we’re too much into the quarter so you’ve got to have a fairly good grasp on what your rd expense should look like this quarter so could you just kind of give us a range of where you think that number will be teresa p covington i think the rd for the first quarter if you exclude the fourth quarter from  the range for rd will be in the range of the quarters from fiscal ’ quarters one two and three troy jensen so you’re talking  million to  million roughly on a quarterly basis teresa p covington correct troy jensen but you said excluding july quarter most of that would  might be at a higher level teresa p covington as tim mentioned the fourth quarter was abnormally high at  million our first three quarters of fiscal ’ were closer to our historic levels in terms of rd investment operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of peter arment with sterne agee your line is now open please go ahead peter arment hi yes i guess just to followon on that tim the last couple of years you’ve kind of had a revenue base that kind of was  in the first half of the fiscal year and kind of  in the second half of the year with the guidance range you put out and obviously there’s a lot of moving parts and i don’t want to have any doubt on any of it but how do we think about kind of the revenue progression throughout the year timothy e conver i think the best  a good way to approach that is just looking at those historic patterns that you mentioned we have been about  in the first half   in the first half and  in the second half even as we look at  q this year probably looks a lot like q last year peter arment okay that’s helpful and then tim if i could ask you about in terms of your building cash position you guys continue to obviously generate a lot of cash and make the necessary internal investments on these a lot of these growth opportunities but at what point do we either the cash just for term record shareholders or you see an external use for where you’re going to look to acquire or something can you give us a little color on your thoughts on that thank you timothy e conver yes absolutely the management and the board are regularly looking at capital allocation and evaluating options for return on invested capital to date we have continued to look at that in the terms of primarily these very large growth opportunities that we are pursuing and that we’ve been talking about today in positioning for multiple new market opportunities that have billion dollar potential our investments to date have primarily been in on the income statement to position ourselves for those markets when those markets adopt we expect the likelihood and historically we have seen the necessity to increase our investments to ensure adoption and once they have adopted and begin to scale across an industry if we then have proven  if it then proves to be the kind of large opportunity we believed we will either be displacing or attracting the largest competitors in the space which means we will have to move with great agility and make meaningful investments to secure a leading position in order to deliver the return to our stock holders that we have been investment for all these years that ability to move with agility is significantly enabled by the cash on the balance sheet and that’s what has driven our structure to date at some time in the future if in the context of those compelling returns on executing our plan the board  if the board ever determines that we continue  that we in that time have excess cash then obviously we will consider other uses of that cash peter arment thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of bobby burleson with canaccord your line is now open please go ahead bobby burleson hi this is a question for tim i was curious when i look at the opportunity for commercial uas can you talk about additional investments in enterprise solutions how much is data analytics part of that investment in developing your own proprietary data analytics and how long could you sustain that investment if you’re looking at energy and agriculture and maybe other verticals how much reuse do you get out of what you developed for one timothy e conver data analytics we believe will be a significant element of that system solution that we intent to deliver and that we believe will be the basis of the winning solution to date we have addressed that with the combination of internal development and extensive use of external partners so i think we will continue that approach we do not intend to build out everything from scratch so wherever possible as we have to date we’ll engage with the existing enterprises that have large and optimized solutions much like we’ve done in addressing the multiple applications with bp on the north slope so its  i don’t know if that fully answered your question but i’ll wait to have you followup bobby burleson no that definitely helps so you obviously don’t want to compete with your customer lets say in the agricultural space it sounds like timothy e conver no but the agricultural vertical at least this much if not more so than energy is is a pretty complex set of opportunities that runs through across the growers operation and precedes it and follows they proved after that leaves the grower so it’s a pretty interesting opportunity rich new frontier i believe operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of greg konrad with jefferies your line is now open please go ahead greg konrad good afternoon i was hoping just to start on the ev business i looked at ees in the quarter it was down a bit i think you said some of that was the industrial business when i think about the past couple of years you’ve announced a number of agreements with electric cars for on the charger side can you maybe discuss a little bit what type of take rate you’re seeing there and some of the larger opportunities to announce other agreements with oes timothy e conver well we do have a half a dozen relationships with some of the largest auto manufactures in the world they’re a very important part of our business strategy one of our channels for distribution of our charging systems is through the dealer networks of those oems we think it’s particularly important that we’ve been able to announce this recent adoption of volvo of turbocord that now included turbocord with the delivery of their plugin vehicles that will begin with their premium model launch in north america later this year that’s an entirely new distribution channel it has the potential to grow across we believe other oems it seems to us like a compelling advantage to consumers and that channel has the ability to significantly lever volume because it comes with the car when the consumer buys it greg konrad that makes sense and then just to followup on cash you had a very good conversion rate this year and it seems like inventories came down quite a bit what should we expect going forward and kind of given the growth expectations of ’ should we expect working capital to come up a bit from ’ timothy e conver i think the biggest  we were very focused on driving that inventory number down this year that inventory number peaked a couple of years ago and it’s been a priority for the  the operating management team to get to the target that they achieved at the end of the fourth quarter i think at this point going forward it would be a good assumption to just plan on us keeping the same kind of rations as we move along with growing revenue operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of michael ciarmoli with keybanc capital markets your line is now open please go ahead michael ciarmoli hi good evening guys thanks for taking the question tim you kind of mentioned it before i mean in terms of creating shareholder value i mean what do you think you guys might be doing wrong the playbook you guys have now i guess its still  it’s still generally similar to the s filed nine years ago there’s a lot of growth opportunities earnings aren’t growing it seems like the commercial market to some extent is passing you guys by when you look at dji or what gopro wants to do google and amazon i mean i don’t  do you think the market really cares about exquisite optimized solutions or do they just want cheap drones with off the shelf analytics out there just trying to get a sense from a strategic standpoint and a shareholder value standpoint what you guys are thinking out there because it just seems like some of that first mover advantage has kind of eroded on you guys timothy e conver well we’ve talked about multiple market opportunities you’re addressing the commercial uas market opportunity explicitly michael and i think the  we continue to see a very large opportunity with the major organizations in large verticals that i described now that’s quite different than the market for consumer quadcopters that you’re addressing and certainly that’s generated a lot of market cap and a lot of initial investment that’s been publicized in the last few months nevertheless we believe that our validation with large industrial users of this enterprise model is going to produce a significant opportunity that we continue to pursue outside of the commercial uas market we’ve been pursuing global observer and mail and tactical missile system market opportunities and we see beginning last year significant increased adoption activity from customers that activity has sustained and increased over the last year and we’re now in a position to be able to look at likely contract decisions in those three areas this year and next year that if made positively would signal the adoption of billion dollar potential markets with these new solutions so i think we have proven the underlying truth of the statement we’ve made for many years that it’s hard to predict the timing and the rate of adoption of innovations michael ciarmoli got it even on something like i mean you mentioned and i mentioned each ai the quadcopters are you  you’ve got the shrike product you guys probably could have attack that market first i mean is there  when you guys look at your product roadmap and kind of or do you think you’re at the right price points to spark this adoption or is it still too early too tough to tell timothy e conver we are using a very end of our shrike product in the cube system that we work with public safety agencies with as they evaluate the adoption of uas in their enterprises that’s not  that is much closer to a variant of a defense product than it is a quadcopter in the consumer class that you’re describing so we’ve not entered the market with a low price point product that you’re describing and that’s not our espoused strategy operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of josephine millward with benchmark company your line is now open please go ahead josephine millward hi tim so can you guys hear me hi there timothy e conver yes we can hello josephine millward hi there given your backlog of  million can you walk us through how you get visibility for guidance now teresa i think you said you have  visibility based on your backlog and it sounds like you expect dod uas sustainment and upgrades to remain fairly steady and you expect switchblade and international to drive growth can you expand on that teresa p covington let me walk through the fiscal ’ visibility again we have  million of q ending backlog that we believe we can execute in’ orders that we booked thus far in the first quarter of  million  million holding ees revenue flat and then we believe the balance of government fiscal  not yet booked of  million and so that totals to the  million josephine millward okay is that  million from the base budget because that seems quite high teresa p covington it is not from the base budget as you know from our history our actual orders often exceed what is published in the government budget so this represents expectations of bookings josephine millward and the other  what can you expand on what areas they might come from timothy e conver well as usual at this time of the year josephine we have what steve wright ph used to refer to as a go get element of our business plan for the year and that’s defined by a set of business opportunities that we have identified with customers that we’re in various stages of pursuing and they’re in various stages of contracting for to the degree that there is uncertainty farther out in the year in those bookings then we use a method to discount the probabilities of either the contract not being placed or more likely a delay in contract placement such that we can get to a probability of revenue that then leads to our plan and to the guidance we’re providing you operator thank you operator instructions and i’m showing a followup from the line of andrea james with dougherty  company your line is now open please go ahead andrea james hi thanks for taking my followups just a couple of housekeeping and then more strategic teresa what was your customer funded rd in q can you hear me timothy e conver yes she heard you she is just checking the number andrea andrea james oh thank you i appreciate it teresa p covington for the fourth quarter the customer funded was  million andrea james thank you and then  that’s the other indiscernible was  million okay and then so net net by the end of this year fy you think you’ve added to the cash balance over the course of the year timothy e conver could you repeat the question please andrea james if you plan to  i’m just looking at free cash flow and kind of what i think you’ve communicated so far in this call do you think you’ve added to the cash balance over the course of this fiscal year by the end of the year timothy e conver well we did last year we have historically we don’t guide on cash so i don’t  we don’t have a forecast that we’re prepared to guide on at this point but we continue to have confidence in the strength of the core business andrea james that’s helpful and then to build off an earlier question what’s the strategic conversation that you guys have had or to what level have you had a conversation about possibly going after that consumer market the quadcopter market and why not is it because its commoditized or just what is your thinking about whether or not to go after that business and leverage maybe your brand name a little bit timothy e conver well as we’ve mentioned for the last year we’ve been focused on the commercial enterprise solution but the opportunity to address the consumer appetite for these products with a leapfrog technology has not escaped the innovation halls of aerovironment engineering so i probably don’t want to get too far ahead of myself on that but it’s an interesting question you pose andrea james and it sounds like you guys it’s something you might be studying at least fair enough okay i appreciate you taking my followups thank you timothy e conver thank you andrea operator thank you and our next question is a followup from the line of josephine millward with benchmark company your line is now open please go ahead josephine millward hi tim i just wanted to ask you when do you expect a phase  of tern to be awarded and if you can talk about the size of the program and do you have that  some of that in your guidance timothy e conver our best understanding is that darpa expects to make a decision on the phase  of the tern program probably in the second half of our fiscal  we are  as i mentioned in my prior comments we’re very focused on executing on phase  and positioning ourselves well for phase  we think we have a strong position but we know we’re competing against one of the world’s largest and most successful suppliers we’ve got a very strong industry team working with us on this that are as excited about this opportunity as we are and to i guess in terms of the component of our revenue plan that would anticipate this program i’d go back to the earlier answer on the how we address uncertain  uncertainty in late in contract opportunities that fall late in the year and that tends to be adjusted for probabilities mostly in the past we found that when the actual results vary from the potential results it’s the cause is dominated by schedule slides rather than some other reason josephine millward and the size of the program tim timothy e conver i don’t believe that i’ve seen a number published by darpa on that program they have said they intend to produce an operating solution so we’re talking about a male airplane i would guess it’s a material contract operator thank you and i’m showing no further questions at this time i’d like to turn the call back over to mr steve gitlin for any closing remarks steven a gitlin thank you for
