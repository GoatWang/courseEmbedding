what are the tradeoffs that must be considered in making the decision to restructure in order to best implement strategy as opposed to taking the organization as a given and developing a strategy keeping structure fixed there are many organizations currently operating on business models and strategies that were developed several to many years ago these models and strategies may work but can they be better over the past decade information technology has advanced ebusiness models have exploded the internet has been on fire and ceo’s have changed so fast it can make you dizzy should a new ceo of an organization consider a restructuring in order to best implement a strategy for today’s changing business practices or just continue with the organization as given before deciding a ceo must clearly consider if this will “improve profitability improve returns on company assets lower the organizations break even point reduce financial and operational risks and increase shareholder value”

are also benefits in maintaining an organizations current structure and just providing some better business practices to improve the organizations operations the cost in of doing this is remarkable less then a full restructuring the staff remains comfortable without the fear of drastic change and the business continues without much interruption or interference of a full restructuring the ceo must carefully decide on whether to restructure or maintain the current structure of an organization overall the decision must lead to reduced expenses increased profits improved cash flow and productivity increased shareholder value decreased organizational beaurocracy increased market share decisionmaking sales and customer satisfaction which is zander doing in  ed zander was elected as motorola’s new ceo and brought a wealth of experience to motorola he had over  years of experience in the technology area and was previously the ceo of sun micro systems it did not take the motorola staff long to recognize that ed zander was different from their previous ceo he was known as a “brash brooklynite” crockett he was everything the previous ceo was not he was demanding expected results and would hold individuals accountable his immediate focus was on improving innovation and operational efficiency as the new ceo of motorola ed zander needed to decide whether he wanted to accept the company’s structure as is or to implement is own restructuring plan ed zander immediately seen that the company was plagued by employee quality and communication issues financial confusion and delayed launch dates for new products motorola had many challenges and opportunities it was “plagued by a slowmoving culture that did not recognize the looming opportunity in converged mobile devices” krazit zander made the quick decision that motorola needed immediate and drastic change and was set to restructure the company zander’s vision for motorola was for “seamless motility” “seamless mobility is a “world where someone can be connected to the internet in the home in the office in his or her automobile or just walking down the street” krazit “just as important as the structural changes will be the strategy that goes with it” crockett zander stepped into a very hostile culture and had a lot to prove “motorolas departments have been referred to as warring tribes and zander had to act quickly and get them to work as a team crockett to achieve teamwork he created a bonus structure for employees that “based  of all bonuses on customer satisfaction meeting product deadlines and cooperation between departments” his business strategy also included targeting major corporations for “communications gear and services instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear” enwikipediaorg zander saw a need to restructure motorolas business divisions and trim costs several divisions were performing duplicate services and he saw the opportunity to streamline production reduce costs and unnecessary positions zander understands that when it comes down to business it is providing the customer what they want when they want it and providing shareholder value did zander make the correct decision his restructuring plan appeared to be a good move in a time when competition was tough he trimmed the company down reduced costs and developed new products that would keep the business growing his strategy appeared to be on track but fell short in providing improved shareholder value from his takeover as ceo in  to today he has improved the companies stock by only  percent with a dividend pay out of  percent for an over all annual growth rate of  percent considering a money market savings account paid an average of  percent and the sp  was up about  percent annually i would say his performance has severely underperformed and was lackluster in the least “reorganization  restructuring” from solvencycom website url httpwwwsolvencycomreorganihtm

statement mobile view moribund motorola loses ceo  mobile gazette  mobile phone news    home  out now  coming soon advertise  wap  search  subscribe          moribund motorola loses ceo nd december  after suffering from a prolonged bout of sliding sales cost cuts and collapsing profits motorola have finally parted from top man ed zander pictured in a move that many investors will welcome motorola is not purely a mobile phone company but handsets account for a large proportion of business motorolas recent successes and failures have mostly been on the back of the motorola razr design that had proven to be a costly addiction see our article why the razr is killing motorola for a more indepth view so is zander to blame for motorolas moribund performance although our view is that he has hardly been inspiring we feel that motorolas problems are much deeper as a technology company motorola has interests in all sorts of computing and communications businesses and competitors such as nokia and sony ericsson are focussed very much on mobile handsets but even that is not the real problem  lg and samsung have a huge variety of consumer and industrial products and even they manage to shine brighter than motorola ed zander will be replaced by motorolas chief operating officer greg brown in january the new ceo will need to revitalise motorola with a new range of products that appeal to consumers and can compete headon with the competition weve been waiting for motorola to get its act together for a long time perhaps this change of leadership will make motorola a truly interesting

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object
