us into a fullblown warehouseinventory management system simply the best at any price ryland mansur product manager  emerald pool and spa the best part about finale inventory is how easy it is to operate it is by far the best inventory system on the market the home page breaks your tasks down into separate columns making navigation unbelievably simplistic finale is inexpensive easy to comprehend and so easy to integrate all selling channels for your business whether it be ebay amazon bigcommerce and shipstation integration has been simplified to a point that surpasses any other inventory software on the market finale inventory has been a huge change for our business and we are excited to have them tracking our inventory you will never want to use or have to use another inventory system again finale is by far the easiest inventory system we have come across and it has been wonderful being a part of such a respectful organization they are always putting the customer before themselves never making you feeling unimportant we have been treated wonderful and we are very pleased how they are focused on the customer they ensure that the customer us is happy with their purchase with other companies we were always skeptical paranoid about the inventory tracking working with finale i never have to worry customer service was another huge savior that finale inventory shines in with other software programs we were treated very poorly because we are a small business finale inventory treats every customer wonderfully always there when you need them and never putting calls or issues off to the side the customer service is outstanding if you have any claims or issues they immediately respond and always solving the problem before the ending of a training seminar or a phone call thank you finale inventory for being fantastic katelynn dow operations manager  sweet water decor we love using finale for our inventory system it is so helpful to have a home base for all of the sales channels we use we love that it immediately updates inventory on all sales channels to keep us from overselling  stacey wells manager  the rag company  my immediate first impression is the amazing positive customer support during implementation of finale inventory the training tutorials and available tools have provided an efficient way to resolve any questions when maintaining inventory with the finale inventory application this company continues to expand its software features and i look forward to more options as they grow the integration with other software programs such as bigcommerce shipstation and square was a smooth process i would highly recommend them when considering great customer service and an affordable inventory management system” tom swenson gm  northstar fireworks the past few years we have expanded our warehouse and business to multiple locations we needed to find an inventory system that would allow us to grow and manage our inventory finale staff was great to help us through all the steps of switching over to finale inventory even after we were set up and running they maintain their relationship helping us use finale to its full capacity and always been there to answer questions we just had our atf inspections last week and the inspectors loved the reports finale inventory produced they were able to get their job done efficiently and we were back to work quickly thank you finale michael dileo owner sneaky pete holsters to embrace hyperbole for a moment finale inventory is just right every time i thought it might lack some important feature i discovered that the feature was there just one level deeper down so that it didnt clutter the user interface this is important because the software is robust to say the least without being cluttered or discouraging the best part of the entire system for me is the copy and paste ease with which you can manipulate data if you need to make a change to multiple skus you need only open a spreadsheet and create a few columns with the data you want to add or change copy and paste that data into finale and then assign each column to match with where you need it to go and youre done i could probably go on and on but ill end on this support so far has been stellar and there are many videos that the creators have posted to youtube that allow you to quickly learn every aspect of the system we were up and running in an hour and as we dived into using finale we never felt lost or overwhelmed if you manage a business with inventory and finale inventory is compatible with your software youd do well to give it a hard look cody henderson founder  beetstech its not perfect but none of them are but finale is the the best inventory management software ive used thus far one of the biggest areas of praise i can think of is that i set up shipstation and four different sales channels in a weekend ive used countless at least eight other inventory management softwares and none have been as intuitive and quick to set up because finale integrates with shipstation and shipstation integrates with near everything finale also integrates with practically everything that shipstation integrates with so our ebay amazon woocommerce and newegg transactions are all pulled into finale if we decide to start selling on other marketplaces or change our website from woocommerce to another ecommerce platform finale will almost certainly support them because shipstation does this is one of the biggest challenges weve faced as an online retailer and finale handles it with ease  ben harper manager  the usa trailer store we use finale to control inventory across  different sales channels each with different selling profiles we have individual products sold separately on one site which are sold together as a kit on another some of our channels sell products as options others as individual skus finale handles all of this with a clean interface and minimal headache my first impression was a bit hesitant as some features werent readily apparent but a large part of that was finding the specific feature out of all the powerful tools available and whenever we have had any questionsissues customer service has been amazing finale does everything we need it to and does it extremely well  antonio carrera coo  govacuumcom finale inventorys seamless integration with shipstation has allowed our business to quickly integrate our accounts without major configuration as a major online and brick and mortar retailer we needed a simple solution to manage our inventory across multiple channels a major challenge for us was managing multiple skus that were associated to the same product across several marketplaces finales ability to easily assign multiple skus to a single product id as well as the ability to handle product bundles or kits has significantly reduced our inventory complexity add to this worldclass customer service and you have a recipe for inventory success i highly recommend finale inventory to any multichannel online retailer  james lai president  cutting chair inc after months of testing and trialing every inventory management software and system on the market finale has been such a blessing from the very first day of signing up the finale owner and team have been extremely helpful and responsive to any and every one of our questions or concerns if you use shipstation in our opinion the best shipping management software this is where finale’s strength is it flawlessly syncs with shipstation ensuring that you only ship products that are in stock and order outofstock items finale gives you the things you want in an inventory management software without all the fluff we tried other solutions that tried to be an

dedicated team that it is a pleasure to contact in any case or problem and any software have some we hope finale will keep grow and improve and wish them all the best dev robertson process improvement  brown box ive been looking for an inventory management program for our company for a few years and wasnt having much luck until i looked into finale they provide a clean interface that is quick and web based which is nice the setup was rather easy and their customer service team helps out whenever i have questions about the program and also have added features when possible of all the programs ive reviewed i would highly recommend finale to handle your online market inventory for sure  reid campbell owner  parts haven finale inventory has really allowed us to effectively manage our warehouse we are on a service plan level that provided one on one help setting up the system and believe it was worth the extra money we have been using the service for almost two years and our happy on all fronts as an fyi for us the real part that separates finale from other wms systems are the handheld scanners no other system in this price range offers this functionality and it is a great time saver their customer service is great but not needing to drag a laptop or a funky smartphone solution through the warehouse is a game changer kyle palmer logistic  sock i hit a few snags while trying to set up integration but their team was extremely patient with me and very helpful when guiding me through the process i would recommend finale to anyone they also respond very quickly to emails and questions  mohammad salamah general manager  om electronics inc finale offers inventory management for your online selling channels as well as warehouse easy to use mobile device solution for picking

have recommended this to every person i know simply the best money we have spent on technology in years  derrick pack owner  pack king finale has done great solving the main need we had that is a centralized inventory that is synced across multiple selling platforms they worked with us to be one of the first customers syncing to amazoncouk which was great there have only been a few selling platforms they do not yet support but we are hoping to come soon it is limited in the fact you cannot centralize listingsdata and push those out only inventory stock levels but for the cost of the product this was understood we still love it and plan to continue using it going forward jd patton project manager  patton kiehl group great flexible system our warehouse was a mess before implementing finale inventory since implementing the software we have only had to walk the racks  or  times due to operator error and with the reporting we know exactly where to focus the search prior to using finale it was a weekly occurrence nate garland president  samoco industries finale allowed us to trade a bunch of messy mindboggling excel spreadsheets with dozens of tabs for a powerful program that tracks our inventory in real time even while we are sleeping our spreadsheets were outdated the minute we completed them and required constant updating and babysitting the time we spent slaving over spreadsheets can now be used to focus on researching and adding new products gone are the fears of accidentally opening an older version of a spreadsheet plus shipstation integration and finale work together seamlessly in the background with minimal input required jesse torres warehouse manager  rayno film rayno window film is a leading producer of window tinting film for automotive home and commercial applications before finale it was excruciating to keep track of our window film within excel as each roll has its own serial number finale’s integrated mobile barcode scanner solution and its ability to track serial numbers has significantly reduced our inventory management complexity and streamlined our warehouse operations i simply scan the serial number of the roll and i am done as an added bonus we were able print professional looking barcode labels within finale without having to buy additional label printing software best of all if i ever get stuck with something that does not make sense to me in finale someone is always available to help me with the issue everyone i’ve ever dealt with has always been so knowledgeable and helpful i would highly recommend

order and guides them to the correct standard bin where each product is located the finale team is always very helpful and understanding whenever i have issues roman iomdin inventory manager  houseables my experience with finale inventory has been a pleasant one before using finale i was able to sample a dozen inventory cloud management companies and none of these were able to fully provide me with what i needed either important features were missing or the cost didnt make sense on the other hand finale inventory has been able to provide me with the tools i need to accurately track my warehouse inventory creates purchase orders createmap bundleskits for online sales of multiple products keep track of sales etc although i did run into a few issues in the beginning they were mostly my fault due to not understanding how to use finale everything else was quickly resolved through customer service including prompt replies to answer any question i may have had charity ambrose manager  legit supplements ive compared many different inventory platforms before landing on finale what ultimately sold me was the incredible value they punched for the price i had several criteria that i needed to fulfill for our startup company several of which were matched in other inventory platforms but never all of them once i found finale and how they fulfilled all of our needs i thought it was too good to be true but it wasnt i needed the peace of mind to know that we would have support and access to lots of learning resources not only did they provide this but they set up several one hour training phone chats which were invaluable  katrina spencer project manager  iremedy healthcare i have had a great experience a very smooth transition from brightpearl and any questions that i have are immediately answered by chinh great vendor mark williams  superbody breakthrough we use shopify clickfunnels and shipstation most inventory softwares want their software to be the first

systems the reasons we finally decided on finale inventory were many their user interface is clean and easy to use leads to productivity it is a system that doesnt try to promise you everything and

and inventory data from our websites to qb enterprise step two was inventory control and the next steps will take us into a fullblown warehouseinventory management system simply the best at any price ryland mansur product manager  emerald pool and spa the best part about finale inventory is how easy it is to operate it is by far the best inventory system on the market the home page breaks your tasks down into separate columns making navigation unbelievably simplistic finale is inexpensive easy to comprehend and so easy to integrate all selling channels for your business whether it be ebay amazon bigcommerce and shipstation integration has been simplified to a point that surpasses any other inventory software on the market finale inventory has been a huge change for our business and we are excited to have them tracking our inventory you will never want to use or have to use another inventory system again finale is by far the easiest inventory system we have come across and it has been wonderful being a part of such a respectful organization they are always putting the customer before themselves never making you feeling unimportant we have been treated wonderful and we are very pleased how they are focused on the customer they ensure that the customer us is happy with their purchase with other companies we were always skeptical paranoid about the inventory tracking working with finale i never have to worry customer service was another huge savior that finale inventory shines in with other software programs we were treated very poorly because we are a small business finale inventory treats every customer wonderfully always there when you need them and never putting calls or issues off to the side the customer service is outstanding if you have any claims or issues they immediately respond and always solving the problem before the ending of a training seminar or a phone call thank you finale inventory for being fantastic katelynn dow operations manager  sweet water decor we love using finale for our inventory system it is so helpful to have a home base for all of the sales channels we use we love that it immediately updates inventory on all sales channels to keep us from overselling  stacey wells manager  the rag company  my immediate first impression is the amazing positive customer support during implementation of finale inventory the training tutorials and available tools have provided an efficient way to resolve any questions when maintaining inventory with the finale inventory application this company continues to expand its software features and i look forward to more options as they grow the integration with other software programs such as bigcommerce shipstation and square was a smooth process i would highly recommend them when considering great customer service and an affordable inventory management system” tom swenson gm  northstar fireworks the past few years we have expanded our warehouse and business to multiple locations we needed to find an inventory system that would allow us to grow and manage our inventory finale staff was great to help us through all the steps of switching over to finale inventory even after we were set up and running they maintain their relationship helping us use finale to its full capacity and always been there to answer questions we just had our atf inspections last week and the inspectors loved the reports finale inventory produced they were able to get their job done efficiently and we were back to work quickly thank you finale michael dileo owner sneaky pete holsters to embrace hyperbole for a moment finale inventory is just right every time i thought it might lack some important feature i discovered that the feature was there just one level deeper down so that it didnt clutter the user interface this is important because the software is robust to say the least without being cluttered or discouraging the best part of the entire system for me is the copy and paste ease with which you can manipulate data if you need to make a change to multiple skus you need only open a spreadsheet and create a few columns with the data you want to add or change copy and paste that data into finale and then assign each column to match with where you need it to go and youre done i could probably go on and on but ill end on this support so far has been stellar and there are many videos that the creators have posted to youtube that allow you to quickly learn every aspect of the system we were up and running in an hour and as we dived into using finale we never felt lost or overwhelmed if you manage a business with inventory and finale inventory is compatible with your software youd do well to give it a hard look cody henderson founder  beetstech its not perfect but none of them are but finale is the the best inventory management software ive used thus far one of the biggest areas of praise i can think of is that i set up shipstation and four different sales channels in a weekend ive used countless at least eight other inventory management softwares and none have been as intuitive and quick to set up because finale integrates with shipstation and shipstation integrates with near everything finale also integrates with practically everything that shipstation integrates with so our ebay amazon woocommerce and newegg transactions are all pulled into finale if we decide to start selling on other marketplaces or change our website from woocommerce to another ecommerce platform finale will almost certainly support them because shipstation does this is one of the biggest challenges weve faced as an online retailer and finale handles it with ease  ben harper manager  the usa trailer store we use finale to control inventory across  different sales channels each with different selling profiles we have individual products sold separately on one site which are sold together as a kit on another some of our channels sell products as options others as individual skus finale handles all of this with a clean interface and minimal headache my first impression was a bit hesitant as some features werent readily apparent but a large part of that was finding the specific feature out of all the powerful tools available and whenever we have had any questionsissues customer service has been amazing finale does everything we need it to and does it extremely well  antonio carrera coo  govacuumcom finale inventorys seamless integration with shipstation has allowed our business to quickly integrate our accounts without major configuration as a major online and brick and mortar retailer we needed a simple solution to manage our inventory across multiple channels a major challenge for us was managing multiple skus that were associated to the same product across several marketplaces finales ability to easily assign multiple skus to a single product id as well as the ability to handle product bundles or kits has significantly reduced our inventory complexity add to this worldclass customer service and you have a recipe for inventory success i highly recommend finale inventory to any multichannel online retailer  james lai president  cutting chair inc after months of testing and trialing every inventory management software and system on the market finale has been such a blessing from the very first day of signing up the finale owner and team have been extremely helpful and responsive to any and every one of our questions or concerns if you use shipstation in our opinion the best shipping management software this is where finale’s strength is it flawlessly syncs with shipstation ensuring that you only ship products that are in stock and order outofstock items finale gives you the things you want in an inventory management software without all the fluff we tried other solutions that tried to be an allinone solution but they all end up being mediocre services regular updates of the software leave our team comfortable knowing that as a system finale is always pushing for optimal streamlined cutting edge performance and integrations we are elated to be using finale and already have accounts for both of our companies  stav barsheshet  antelope shoes finale is the best smb inventory available on the market weve reviewed  different cloudbased software solutions and found many of the platforms had lots of connection problems with magento in addition to missing information when syncing to shipstation finale integration works great all the order information comes right to shipstation and then to finale to sync inventory to the other marketplaces almost instantly they have a dedicated team that it is a pleasure to contact in any case or problem and any software have some we hope finale will keep grow and improve and wish them all the best dev robertson process improvement  brown box ive been looking for an inventory management program for our company for a few years and wasnt having much luck until i looked into finale they provide a clean interface that is quick and web based which is nice the setup was rather easy and their customer service team helps out

reid campbell owner  parts haven finale inventory has really allowed us to effectively manage our warehouse we are on a service plan level that provided one on one help setting up the system and believe it was worth the extra money we have been using the service for almost two years and our happy on all fronts as an fyi for us the real part that separates finale from other wms systems are the handheld scanners no other system in this price range offers this functionality and it is a great time saver their customer service is great but not needing to drag a laptop or a funky smartphone solution through the warehouse is a game changer kyle palmer logistic  sock i hit a few snags while trying to set up integration but their team was extremely patient with me and very helpful when guiding me through the process i would recommend finale to anyone they also respond very quickly to emails and questions  mohammad salamah general manager  om electronics inc finale offers inventory

technology in years  derrick pack owner  pack king finale has done great solving the main need we had that is a centralized inventory that is synced across multiple selling platforms they worked with us to be one of the first customers syncing to amazoncouk which was great there have only been a few selling platforms they do not yet support but we are hoping to come soon it is limited in the fact you cannot centralize listingsdata and push those out only inventory stock levels but for the cost of the product this was understood we still love it and plan to continue using it going forward jd patton project manager  patton kiehl group great flexible system our warehouse was a mess before implementing finale inventory since implementing the software we have only had to walk the racks  or  times due to operator error and with the reporting we know exactly where to focus the search prior to using finale it was a weekly occurrence nate garland president  samoco industries finale allowed us to trade a bunch of messy mindboggling excel spreadsheets with dozens of tabs for a powerful program that tracks our inventory in real time even while we are sleeping our spreadsheets were outdated the minute we completed them and required constant updating and babysitting the time we spent slaving over spreadsheets can now be used to focus on researching and adding new products gone are the fears of accidentally opening an older version of a spreadsheet plus shipstation integration and finale work together seamlessly in the background with minimal input required jesse torres warehouse manager  rayno film rayno window film is a leading producer of window tinting film for automotive home and commercial applications before finale it was excruciating to keep track of our window film

ultimately sold me was the incredible value they punched for the price i had several criteria that i needed to fulfill for our startup company several of which were matched in other inventory platforms but never all of them once i found finale and how they fulfilled all of our needs i thought it was too good to be true but it wasnt i needed the peace of mind to know that we would have
