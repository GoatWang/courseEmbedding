information about the fund and may be obtained by calling trindex  or visiting wwwtortoiseindexsolutionscom read it carefully before investing shares of exchange traded funds etfs are not individually redeemable and owners of the shares may acquire those shares from the etf and tender those shares for redemption to the etf in creation units only see the etf prospectus for additional information regarding creation units investors may purchase or sell etf shares throughout the day through any brokerage account which will result in typical brokerage commissions investing involves risk principal loss is possible the fund is nondiversified meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund therefore the fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund investing in specific sectors such as energy pipelines may involve greater risk and volatility than less concentrated investments risks include but are not limited to risks associated with companies owning andor operating energy pipelines as well as master limited partnerships mlps mlp affiliates capital markets terrorism natural disasters climate change operating regulatory environmental supply and demand and price volatility risks the tax benefits received by an investor investing in the fund differ from that of a direct investment in an mlp by an investor the value of the fund’s investment in an mlp will depend largely on the mlp’s treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes if the mlp is deemed to be a corporation then its income would be subject to federal taxation reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to the fund which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value investments in nonus companies including canadian issuers involve risk not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of us issuers including risks related to political social and economic developments abroad differences between us and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements tax risk and market practices as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies the fund invests in small and midcap companies which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies the fund is not actively managed and therefore the fund generally will not sell a security due to current or projected underperformance of a security industry or sector unless that security is removed from the index or the selling of the security is otherwise required upon a rebalancing of the
