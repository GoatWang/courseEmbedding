fda seizes misbranded supplement products quackwatch home page fda seizes misbranded supplement products stephen barrett md on february   at the request of the us food and drug administration fda us marshals seized products from global source management  consulting inc in sunrise florida the seizure which encompassed  bottles and  bulk capsules worth nearly  was made because the fda determined that these products were being marketed with illegal claims that included preventing cancers and treating arthritis after investigating the firms marketing practices the agency warned that many of its products made drug claims that subject them to be regulated as drugs during subsequent inspections despite the warnings fda inspectors obtained copies of product labels and promotional catalogs that contained the illegal claims  the seizure included about  products that were marketed under the names vitamin hut and rx for health through retail booths and by mail order the food and drug laws do not permit dietary supplements to make claims that the products will cure mitigate treat or prevent disease moreover the labeling must be truthful and not misleading because these seized products made disease claims on the labels and in promotional catalogs fda considers them to be unapproved new drugs before an unapproved new drug product may be marketed it must be shown to be safe and effective and approved by fda drug product labeling must also include adequate directions for use which the seized products labeling did not provide  the company was founded in  by gary r dubin who has bs degrees in chemistry and zoology and an mba it operates many vitamin hut retail outlets in highvolume malls airports and train stations its web site states global offers information on thousands of herbs vitamins minerals biologicals and a variety of alternative care products as well as over a hundred disorders this information is provided on the internet from the leading experts in the field through excerpts taken from health books  leading experts are they kidding clicking the sites link for disorders information brings the reader to a supplements relating to disorders table that

brings up a page containing a description of the condition plus information about causes and treatments taken from the second edition of prescription for natural healing by james f balch jr md and phyllis a balch cnc  james f balch jr is a urologist who practiced in indiana but is no longer listed as licensed in the state medical boards directory so i assume that he now devotes his time to writing in a predecessor book published in  he described how phyllis had counseled hundreds of his patients and used hair analysis and cytotoxic testing as a guide  both are quack tests  during the mids james was also associated with a glenn braswell a mailorder retailer who flooded the country with brochures some accompanied by letters under balchs name for dubious herbal and supplement products  the books back cover describes phyllis balch as a certified nutritional consultant who received her certification from the american association of nutritional consultants and has been a leading nutritional consultant for almost two decades she also founded good things naturallya healthfood store in greenfield indiana aanc is a thoroughly disreputable organization whose only membership requirement has been payment of a  fee and whose cnc designation is based on passage of an openbook examination based mainly on the contents of quacky books  about  of the books  pages provide an atoz compendium of health problems and the authors lists of nutrients that are essential very important important or helpful some lists contain more than thirty items the authors recommend daily dosages of  mg or more of vitamin c for everybody for maintaining good health and higher doses up to  mgday under a doctors supervision for dozens of problems they also recommend daily dosages of emulsified vitamin a ranging from  to  iu for many conditions and  iu for maintaining healthy eyes  the vitamin c dosages are high enough to produce severe diarrhea and the vitamin a dosages are high enough to cause liver injury from a scientific viewpoint the books advice is loony from beginning to end but the dietary supplement industry loves it because it enables retailers to refer their customers to an authoritative source of advice for nearly every problem the customer may have  in  posing as potential customers fda agents visited health food stores in  communities and asked a what do you sell to help high blood pressure b do you have anything to help fight infection or help my immune system and c do you have anything that works on cancer in response to about  of the queries the retailer looked up the answer in prescription for nutritional healing or advised the agent to refer to or purchase it  the  dietary supplement health and education act dshea permits sellers to provide thirdparty literature that contains nutritional support claims that are truthful and not misleading to be legal under dshea a nutritional support statement must not be a drug claim in other words it should not suggest that the product or ingredient is intended for preventing or treating disease i do not believe that globals use of the book is legal the information it provides is taken from the books nutrient tables and herbal advice which give products and doses for preventing andor treating diseases globals cancer page for example recommends coenzyme q improves cellular oxygenation garlic enhances immune function melatonin a powerful antioxidant that also aids sleep natural betacarotene needed by all cells for repair and rebuilding selenium powerful free radical scavenger aids in protein digestion shark cartilage for cancer treatment vitamin a up to  iuday vitamin b complex vitamin c powerful anticancer agent   to  milligramsday vitamin e grape seed extract kelp or seaweed multimineral complex with calcium magnesium and potassium multivitamin complex dandelion echinacea green tea red clover suma and cats claw enhances immune function and has antitumor properties green tea may have some value as a preventive but the rest of this list has not been proven useful for prevention or treatment  and betacarotene supplements may even increase cancer risk  it seems to me that the claims on globals web site are far more blatant than those for which the fda took regulatory action since the site is a form of advertising i believe that the federal trade commission also has jurisdiction and should act references fda seizes dietary supplements fda news release feb   company profile global source management web site accessed feb   supplements relating to disorders
