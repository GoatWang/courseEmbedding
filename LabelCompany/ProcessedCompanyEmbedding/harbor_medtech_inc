stimulate patient’s antimicrobial peptide amp defense system in the wound chandan k sen phd professor of surgery and director of the ohio state university’s center for regenerative medicine and cell based therapies praised the work of dr steiner’s team and added “what we are seeing with architect® are wound healing activities we have not seen with other products  although these are early data we

gradually increasing in size  previous wound treatments included topical alginates collagen dressings collagenase petrolatum gauze and moist saline gauze  all previous topical therapies had failed half of the wound was covered with a human allograft based product with the other half covered by a stabilized ecm after  weeks of treatment the wound treated with the human allograft based product remained open with no healing properties remaining after th week just  application healed the wound in  weeks an optimally stabilized collagenbased xenograft by its ability to withstand the destructive activity of proteolytic enzymes appears able to create an environment conducive to healing it is conceivable that the stabilized collagen in the xenograft reduced the rate and length of the inflammatory processes associated with continued presence of digested collagen eptides… the reduction in pain experienced by this patient also suggests a role played by the biologic in altering additional inflammatory processes in the wound bed a significant consideration when treating asculitic ulcers as mulder et al stated ³ initial preop presentation left foot medial side

surgery postmohs surgery podiatric wounds dehisced surgical incision … learn more about the mechanism of action study at osu click here the roll of ecms in wound healing magnified image of an ecm what makes up an ecm extracellular matrix’s ecm’s are a complex meshwork of structural and functional proteins including collagens and integrins glycoproteins hyaluronan proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans gags that provide structure and support for cells and tissues  collagen is one of the major constituents of the ecm existing in many different types depending on the tissue and often forming fibres  fibronectin and laminin are two other protein constituents of the ecm ecms stimulate and support cell proliferation’s essential for tissue regeneration by ¹² acting as a reservoir for growth factors and cytokines that are crucial to tissue regeneration supporting and regulating the movement of cells cell signaling to trigger and modulate the wound healing cascade ecms are commonly used as “skin substitutes” because of these important tissue regeneration properties unfortunately in chronic wounds ecms are susceptible to rapid degradation by an excess of various enzymes such as matrix metalloprotease mmps and other proteases ³ “the unifying pathophysiological hypothesis for chronic wounds is that the inflammatory phase of healing is exaggerated with the excess of proteases and mmps in chronic wounds breaking down too many components of the ecm as well as inhibiting growth factors that are essential for tissue synthesis” as muller et al stated in addition chronic wounds can also have an elevated neutrophil pmns infiltration in response to persistent bacterial infections which further exaggerates the ecmdegrading environment  ultimately many researchers have concluded that “continued degradation of an ecmbased dressing    exacerbates this inflammatory environment further delaying healing” this is the problem we are addressing with architect®  architect® is the only ecm stabilized by the bridge® process which prevents premature degradation by the excess mmps and other proteases found in chronic wounds because architect® remains intact its ecm healing properties remain intact including helping to deactivate the inflammatory phase which results in a reduction of mmps elastase and other proteases helping to promote the proliferativehealing phase preserving cell signaling factors to trigger and accelerate healing providing an intact durable scaffold for uninterrupted support of cellular growth and regeneration of native tissue how is architect different from all other ecmbased wound care products virtually all skin substitutes used for treating chronic skin wounds are simply ecm’s in one form or another  the challenge faced by other ecm’s is their rapid degradation by the excess mmps and other proteases found in chronic wounds  not only does rapid ecm degradation potentially extend the inflammatory phase it requires continual replacement of the ecm to support cellular ingrowth up to  applications in some cases  timing the replacement of a degraded ecm is critical otherwise healing stalls because architect® remains intact its ecm healing properties remain active causing tissue regeneration to take place architect® helps to deactivate the inflammatory phase which results in a reduction of mmps elastase and other proteases architect® serves as a catalyst in the proliferativehealing phase serving as a homing base for autologous growth factors epithelial fibroblasts endothelial immune cells etc creating a gradient for prohealing cues architect® preserves cell signaling factors to trigger an accelerate healing architect® provides an intact durable scaffold for uninterrupted support of cellular growth and regeneration of native tissue architect® strengthens antimicrobial defenses such as antimicrobial peptides amp and these properties are uninterrupted for the duration of treatment why does architect®  show faster healing because bridge®  stabilized ecm’s do not stall what is architect made of architect® is made from a widely available xenograft commonly used in modern tissue heart valves and many other medical products  this tissue is strong homogeneous over  type  collagen durable and porous making it an ideal wound matrix to support cellular ingrowth throughout the healing process magnified trilayered cross section how is architect used architect® can be applied to a wound immediately after thorough debridement no need to wait  weeks as required for many other products and architect® is designed to require only one application to the wound  in most cases architect® is applied directly to the properly prepared wound bed secured to the perimeter of the wound with sutures staples or tape eg steristrip® and a surgical bandage is applied to ensure continual contact of architect® to the wound bed  during proper healing as the wound margins recede the excess edges of architect® is trimmed away until the wound finally heals and the remaining portion of architect® falls off is architect convenient no skin substitute is more convenient than architect architect® is stored at room temperature in easy to use double peel packs no complex refrigeration or special equipment required architect® can be rehydrated for use in a matter of minutes for quick and easy application no complex thawing or preparation procedures architect® is strong enough to secure to the wound using sutures staples or tape eg steristrip® ensuring the product remains in place architect® is terminally sterilized not just “aseptically processed” architect® requires only one application no need for invasive reapplications  debridements architect® is a sterile fda cleared medical device meaning no human tissue  hctp  or biologic tracking is required the ultimate convenience is the fact that architect does not require reapplication or additional debridements while most alternative products require weekly reapplication often in a surgical setting and requiring additional debridement architect® recommends periodic inspection of the secondary dressing and secondary dressing change as needed to manage exudates and maintain good hydration of architect®   as healing occurs the edges of architect® may gradually peel and be trimmed during dressing changes there is no need for reapplication or additional debridement in most cases  this makes architect® the right choice for doctors nurses and wound care professionals who seek to provide their patients with the best quality of care and convenience available is architect cost effective architect® is very cost effective  the cost of architect® is similar to one application of the leading wound matrices  but clinical studies indicate that the major cost advantage of architect® comes from its stabilized collagen    architect® will typically require as few as one application see below compared to ‑
