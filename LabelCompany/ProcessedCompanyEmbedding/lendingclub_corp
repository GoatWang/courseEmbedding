from another leading online lender repayment term  years means lower monthly payments typically less than a year type of rate fixed interest rate simple and transparent factor rate this is not an interest rate and can make expensive loans appear cheaper origination fee     early pay off  you can eliminate interest costs by paying off any time youre charged interest for the entire loan  even if you pay off early monthly payment per  borrowed       daily payments required total annualized rate        factor rate is the financing cost divided by the loan amount  but that’s not how traditional interest rates work for example if you pay  cents for a oneyear loan of one dollar your factor rate is  but is equivalent to a  interest rate factor rates can make shortterm loans appear less expensive than a traditional interest rate would  these loans require you to repay a fixed amount of interest so paying off early wont save you any money in fact it can increase your effective interest rate to  or more  payments calculated based on range of interest rates and repayment terms offered assuming a loan amount of   total annualized rate shows all costs for one year in a single equivalent interest rate so that you can make applestoapples comparisons lending club is america’s  credit marketplace transforming banking to make it more efficient transparent and consumer friendly
