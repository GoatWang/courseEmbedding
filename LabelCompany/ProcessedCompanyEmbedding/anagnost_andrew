from my seat on the board and can’t wait to see where he takes autodesk in the future” said former ceo and board director bass of the appointmentanagnost shares his thoughts directly in a video directed to autodesk employees technology users and partnerswell aware of the existing legacy of innovation at autodesk — he notes that the company was the first to the cloud and the first to employ a subscription model — anagnost notes several items that one would want to hear from a big name company’s new executive leader in addition to already having several ideas for new moves in the works he explains clearly that he looks forward to receiving and acting upon input from users all  of them regarding “what you love” along with “what you want to improve” all for what he sees as a collaborative mission “let’s go out and make a better world together”“for  years i’ve watched autodesk innovate and grow into the company it is today and i’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together” anagnost writes in a letter on the company’s next chapter “but our success isn’t based on a single product business strategy or sales win—it’s a result of the collective efforts of all of you our diverse and global team with your passion ideas and skills we are ready to grow in incredible new ways”autodesk has been increasingly transparent lately in strategy as we recently followed the company’s roadmap for its popular fusion  software and saw firsthand the work being done in some projects such as in aircraft seating and in collaborations for work bringing additive manufacturing to yachts and propellers the company has shown that it is keen to respond to realistic feedback and is embracing its position as a software company not a hardware endeavor though it has dabbled in creating its own d printer now discontinued but with files still available and continues to work alongside d printer manufacturers on some big projectsautodesk at rapid  tct  photo sarah goehrke“autodesk’s history has been defined by periods of both product innovation and business execution we began with a clear goal to transform how design was documented brought d design to the broader market and then became a respected technology leader we were first to bring design to the cloud to mobile and to subscription—and now we’re bringing innovation to the world of making” his letter continues“the next era of autodesk is not defined by product or business innovation—but in their combination  we must excel at both all in the service of our customers to ensure their success and ours we will improve not only our product experience but also our customer experience  and we will continue to deliver incredible tools that customers can use to make a better world”amar hanspal former senior vice president and chief product officerstill as we know that executive leadership is never without some upheaval and upset anagnost notes as well the departure of another longtime member of the autodesk executive team along with anagnost amar hanspal was heading the interim office as coceo in the aftermath of bass’ departure hanspal the company’s senior vice president and chief product officer will no longer be with autodesk following work with the company in customer support and project management positions between  and  and rejoining from  until his justannounced departure during his more recent tenure hanspal worked with such projects as the  introduction of cloudbased forge signing an mou with dubai on behalf of the spark investment fund and presenting the company’s vision at autodesk university among many other initiatives and activitieswith the tumult of a new ceo departure of a longterm executive and all that goes along with the shuffle in corporate structure anagnost is looking to interim appointments to keep business activities afloat“regretfully amar hanspal has decided to leave the company” anagnost shares “as many of you know amar and i have shared countless experiences and tackled great challenges together i’m truly sad to see him leave i’d like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation for his  years of service and all that he’s done to make autodesk our team and our products great with amar’s departure and my new role i’ve asked scott reese to be the acting leader of the product development group and lisa campbell to be the acting leader of business strategy  marketing i recognize that it’s very difficult to say goodbye to a leader we have valued and respected for many years i understand that and i look forward to working closely with you and autodesk leadership on a smooth transition”these appointments and the restructuring seen at autodesk seem to fit right in to  overall as this year has seen some major executive
