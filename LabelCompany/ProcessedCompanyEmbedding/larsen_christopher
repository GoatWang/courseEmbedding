most recent overall rating helpfulness see    displaying items  of  page  of   next militarybrat age  gender female  stars out of  not written for children october   militarybrat age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  imho this book is written way above a level intended for children it is extremely grammar focused and memorization chant intensive without much application page  shows you how to conjugate the verb to love amare chapter  page  introduces  different cases for nounsreallynominative genitive dative accusative and ablative children are expected to chant  endings for each noun  cases for singular and  for pluralã¢â¬âwithout explanations of the cases and when they are used i studied german for  years so im familiar with declensions but id never heard of the ablative case before this book i also studied italian for  years and am familiar with changing adjective endings to agree with the noun and not using pronouns in the nominative but i find it frustrating to teach latin to my  daughters ages  and  using this textbook series the first  vocabulary nouns introduced on page  are water story gate forest and earth the vocabulary words in chapter  are road way ditch table goal turning point page dinner fatherland breeze queen and island i dont foresee my girls wanting to say fatherland or ditch in a conversation anytime soon ive previewed through chapter  and i havent figured out how to say im hungry or im tired or mother and father yet between chapters  and  the vocabulary words include maidservant female servant male servant female slave male slave female master male master and public square this words would be helpful if i were translating a document perhaps i wish the books were written to teach the grammar in bitesized chunks and provide vocabulary that is more applicable to children was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate caroline  stars out of  exactly what we needed great price september

mom of  rock hill sc age  gender female  stars out of  not a great fit for us april   mom of  rock hill sc age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  i tried this program with my yearold daughter and she completed roughly  of the lessons having no experience with latin myself i found the dvd to be helpful however my daughter lacked interest and enthusiasm the program involves a lot of workbook pages and vocabulary memorization it takes weeks before the information comes together in a meaningful way other reviewers seemed to like it for a group and perhaps that would create more opportunity for interaction using it with one student i found it to be rather dull and monotonous i can appreciate the potential benefits of learning latin however this program was not a great fit for us was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate duckys mom  stars out of  june   duckys mom we have only done the first lesson but i can tell you my son loves the latin for children program it is fun but thorough and seems well thoughtout was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate gary gray  stars out of  october   gary gray we belong to an all

studying latin for a long time did you know that for nearly  years most boys and girls going to school in europe studied latin and usually greek toowhen they were young students children learned latin because latin was spoken by so many people and because many good books were written in latin the latin language has been so popular for the last  years that many other languages have borrowed words from latin did you know that about  out of every  english words come from a latin word when you learn latin you are also learning a good bit of english here is an example if i said let me demonstrate how the aquarium is a habitat for this turtle we would discover that  out of the  words capitalized in this sentence are from latin words i hope you can see that learning latin words will be very interesting and enjoyable it will take some hard work however like anything that is really worth learning we will do all that we can to make learning latin enjoyable and help you to clearly understand

paperbackverified purchasei homeschool and we started using the latin for children program this school yearthe primer is very well laid out vocabulary and grammar is repeated in each chapter and really solidifies the learning of the contenti like having the ability to quiz them and having that capability at the end of each chapter is greatthe recommended pace is suggested which we follow in a week days  the lesson is introduced vocabulary and grammar chants are memorized and reviewed day  students take the quizthere are  units and  chapters one could complete this book in a school year if that is desired some fellow teachers have completed it over  years we may very well take this pace instead since it is not our sole foreign languageas with any language even one that is not spoken anymore repetition is key and doing the daily review is really good there is also a section which deals with the english vocabulary from the latin roots this is really essential in building a strong vocabularyi am happy with the book and would recommend this courseread more comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starswellproduced but unbalancedbyamerican elmon april  format paperbackverified purchasefirst the pluses production is firstrate and the book is easy to read the support at the website  is terrific as well especially for flashcards whatever typos that were in the first edition were corrected in the books that i got the authors have clearly been teaching kids for a long time and it shows the text is very very accessiblenow the minus i took my daughters through chapter  before we moved on to another book whyit is just too vocabularyintensive without providing a context for the vocabulary yes my daughters learned the vocabulary but they couldnt do anything with it because there are no reading assignments to correspond to what they memorized in addition there were no translation exercises i did not use the separate reader also published by this author but they dont recommend it until the first half of the book is completed anywaythis means that kids have to go almost  weeks before they actually start doing simple latin sentences and thats too long more time is spent every chapter doing english derivatives from latin than is spent on latin itself and thats ok  learning latin as an aid to learning english vocabulary is a worthy goal  it just isnt the goal that i hadnow the good news  i really really really like the publisher so i bought the latin book that they did for older kids latin alive as soon as it came i put latin for children on the shelf the latin alive book strikes a much better balance there is actually less vocabulary per week than the book designed for younger kids simplified grammar is presented up front at an appropriate pace and most importantly they are reading latin right off the bat latin alive also has flashcard support from so i reluctantly would not recommend latin for children but am very pleased with the same publishers book latin aliveread more comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsgreat curriculum to teach and from which to learnbyalefon january  format paperbackverified purchasei have taught this program for three years now and i love itfirst of all if you are teaching latin using this book i highly recommend that you invest in karen moores training program found through the classical academic press websitemost text books are not meant to provide all the activities a teacher will need to fully engage the children and this is no exception but the cap website has loads of free material and moores training provides guidance on creating more of your own which of course is better because you can tailor it to where your particular students arei teach in a dayaweek schooldayaweek homeschool hybrid and my own child is in her second year of lfc and she and her classmates are all doing great and will take the national latin exam this marchi have friends who are using it in a five day school and in a five day homeschool and it is working well in both of those settings as wellthe program does not contain a lot of fluff it is good hard work which is what most classical approaches to schooling are aiming at these daysin the words of our favorite nunturnedgoverness start at the very beginning its a very good place to start latin for children is teaching the abcs do re mis   s of the latin language it is a partstowhole approach to latin grammarone note  classical academic press recommends starting this program in rd or th grade it has been my experience that to be cheerful and successful a child needs to be quite languagegifted to

do i do love translating so i was slightly disappointed but i fixed that by just making my own the translations really start making sense  way through the book i also do latin specifically to help with english vocabulary so this series works well for my family i had my older sons pick out their spelling words each week by finding english derivatives based on the latin words for the week so that
