whiskers to soften the soap removes oils from your hair and skin but it’s not a shaving gel substitute pal step  apply it how apply a layer of gel to face and let sit for three minutes what you do with your free time is up to you big guy why gel provides extra moisturizers to soften skin reduce friction and carry away debris removed by the razor blade it can also make you look kinda badass step  shave it how most guys say to shave in the direction your hair grows but if you’re not a supersensitive lad you’ll get a closer shave going against the grain ladies dig the smooth why with sensitive skin you’ll avoid irritation if you follow most guys’ advice either way go slow and avoid rapid strokes the only things speed gets you here is a date with tissue pieces step  rinse it how immediately after shaving splash your face with cold water to remove all traces of lather look at you now champ why the cold water closes your facial pores plus no one wants to walk around with shave gel on their face be sure to check those earlobes too step  rest it how rest your skin for  minutes before applying any kind of lotion or medications or before going swimming…really why skin is most sensitive after shaving so waiting will prevent inflammation or irritation plus chlorine or salt water may sting if you rush in for a dip final step thumbs up how nice job how does it feel to get your edge

good right why water allows your whiskers to soften the soap removes oils from your hair and skin but it’s not a shaving gel substitute pal step  apply it how apply a layer of gel to face and let sit for three minutes what you do with your free time is up to you big guy why gel provides extra moisturizers to soften skin reduce friction and carry away debris removed by the razor blade it can also make you look kinda badass step  shave it how most guys say to shave in the direction your hair grows but if you’re not a supersensitive lad you’ll get a closer shave going against the grain ladies dig the smooth why with sensitive skin you’ll avoid irritation if you follow most guys’ advice either way go slow and avoid rapid strokes the only things speed gets you here is a date with tissue pieces step  rinse it how immediately after shaving splash your face with cold water to remove all traces of lather look at you now champ why the cold water closes your facial pores plus no one wants to walk around with shave gel on their face be sure to check those earlobes too step  rest it how rest your skin for  minutes before applying any kind of lotion or medications or before going swimming…really why skin is most sensitive after shaving so waiting will prevent inflammation or irritation plus chlorine or salt water may sting if you rush in for a dip final step thumbs up how nice job how does it feel to get your edge
