of the liquid steel roughing rollingbillet rolling reducing size of blocks product rolling finished shapes the principal raw materials for an integrated mill are iron ore limestone and coal or coke these materials are charged in batches into a blast furnace where the iron compounds in the ore give up excess oxygen and become liquid iron at intervals of a few hours the accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast into pig iron or directed to other vessels for further steel making operations historically the bessemer process was a major advancement in the production of economical steel but it has now been entirely replaced by other processes such as the basic oxygen furnace molten steel is cast into large blocks called blooms during the casting process various methods are used such as addition of aluminum so that impurities in the steel float to the surface where they can be cut off the finished bloom because of the energy cost and structural stress associated with heating and cooling a blast furnace typically these primary steel making vessels will operate on a continuous production campaign of several years duration even during periods of low steel demand it may not be feasible to let the blast furnace grow cold though some adjustment of the production rate is possible integrated mills are large facilities that are typically only economical to build in ton per year annual capacity and up final products made by an integrated plant are usually large structural sections heavy plate strip wire rod railway rails and occasionally long products such as bars and pipe a major environmental hazard associated with integrated steel mills is the pollution produced in the manufacture of coke which is an essential intermediate product in the reduction of iron ore in a blast furnace integrated mills may also adopt some of the processes used in minimills such as arc furnaces and direct casting to reduce production costs world integrated steel production capacity is at or close to world demand so competition between suppliers results in only the most efficient producers remaining viable however due to the large employment

iron dri is sometimes used with scrap to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel though usually dri is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material a typical minimill will have an

furnace and a rolling mill originally the mini mill was adapted to production of bar products only such as concrete reinforcing bar flats angles channels pipe and light rails since the late s successful introduction of the direct strip casting process has made mini mill production of strip feasible often a mini mill will be constructed in an area with no other steel production to take advantage of local markets resources or lowercost labour mini mill plants may specialize for example in making coils of rod for wiredrawing use or pipe or in special sections for transportation and agriculture capacities of mini mills vary some plants may make as much as  tons per year a typical size is in the range  to  tons per year and some old or specialty plants may make as little as  tons

liquid steel casting solidification of the liquid steel roughing rollingbillet rolling reducing size of blocks product rolling finished shapes the principal raw materials for an integrated mill are iron ore limestone and coal or coke these materials are charged in batches into a blast furnace where the iron compounds in the ore give up excess oxygen and become liquid iron at intervals of a few hours the accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast into pig iron or directed to other vessels for further steel making operations historically the bessemer process was a major advancement in the production of economical steel but it has now been entirely replaced by other processes such as the basic oxygen furnace molten steel is cast into large blocks called blooms during the casting process various methods are used such as addition of aluminum so that impurities in the steel float to the surface where they can be cut off the finished bloom because of the energy cost and structural stress associated with heating and cooling a blast furnace typically these primary steel making vessels will operate on a continuous production campaign of several years duration even during periods of low steel demand it may not be feasible to let the blast furnace grow cold though some adjustment of the production rate is possible integrated mills are large facilities that are typically only economical to build in ton per year annual capacity and up final products made by an integrated plant are usually large structural sections heavy plate strip wire rod railway rails and occasionally long products such as bars and pipe a major environmental hazard associated with integrated steel mills is the pollution produced in the manufacture of coke which is an essential intermediate product in the reduction of iron ore in a blast furnace integrated mills may also adopt some of the processes used in minimills such as arc furnaces and direct casting to reduce production costs world integrated steel production capacity is at or close to world demand so competition between suppliers results in only the most efficient producers remaining viable however due to the large employment of integrated plants often governments will financially assist an obsolescent facility rather than take the risk of having thousands of workers thrown out of jobsnot specific enough to verify minimilledit an ingot of steel entering a rolling mill a minimill is traditionally a secondary steel producer however nucor one of the worlds largest steel producers as well as one of its competitors commercial metals company cmc use minimills exclusively usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing direct reduced iron dri is sometimes used with scrap to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel though usually dri is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material a typical minimill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap melting a ladle furnace or vacuum furnace for precision control of chemistry a strip or billet continuous caster for converting molten steel to solid form a reheat furnace and a rolling mill originally the mini mill was adapted to production of bar products only such as concrete reinforcing bar flats angles channels pipe and light rails since the late s successful introduction of the direct strip casting process has made mini mill production of strip feasible often a mini mill will be constructed in an area with no other steel production to take advantage of local markets resources or lowercost labour mini mill plants may specialize for example in making coils of rod for wiredrawing use or pipe or in special sections for transportation and agriculture capacities of mini mills vary some plants may make as much as  tons per year a typical size is in the range  to  tons per year and some old or specialty plants may make as little as  tons per year of finished product nucor corporation for example annually produces around  tons of sheet steel from its four sheet mills  tons of bar steel from its  bar mills and  tons of plate steel from its two plate mills since the electric arc furnace can be easily started and stopped on a regular basis mini mills can follow the market demand for their products easily operating
