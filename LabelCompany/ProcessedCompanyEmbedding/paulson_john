york monday  still a fraction of where it traded when paulson  co reported its first purchase three years ago getting a seat on the board gives paulson a firmer hand on one of his most troublesome

said his firm still believes in valeant’s “core value”“the stock has been all but abandoned at this point” said david tawil the founder of maglan capital lp a new yorkbased hedge fund that specializes in corporate strategies there is a “fair amount of financial engineering” that could be done at valeant a company that was built through acquisitions and lots of debt he said“if they could retrace a considerable amount of that loss it would be a big winner for paulson” tawil saidit will be a challenge paulson’s latest significant valeant transaction came during the second quarter of  when the

strategy that he seems to agree with” jonas said in an interview with bloomberg television “really they’re making the best they can out of a bad situation”david maris an analyst at wells fargo and a longtime critic of valeant viewed the new appointment with skepticism“it could be a sign that a major holder is frustrated with the pace and direction of change” maris who rates the shares

at the white house for a “ceo town hall”but his investors are unlikely to be impressed by his political access his firm paulson  company has recorded nearly doubledigit losses in several of its larger
