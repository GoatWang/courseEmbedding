hope these things can happen for various reasons including  unit prices and yields may decline during the life of the portfolio  rising interest rates will reduce the value of your units typically bonds with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes  a bond issuer or an insurer may be unwilling or unable to meet its obligation to make principal or interest payments resulting in a reduction in the value of your units  the financial condition of a bond issuer or insurer may worsen or their credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units  assuming no changes in interest rates when you sell your units they will generally be worth less than your cost because your cost included a sales charge  the portfolio will receive early returns of principal if bonds are called or sold before they mature if this happens your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield or as long a maturity and  the portfolio is not actively managed and may continue to hold a bond included in the portfolio even though the bonds outlook or its market value or yield may have changed  industry concentration risk  the portfolio is considered to be concentrated in bonds of healthcare facility revenue issuers and bridge and toll road revenue issuers healthcare facility revenue issuers are subject to certain risks including  fluctuating occupancy levels  possible decreases in demand for services  increased costs including overhead wages and malpractice insurance  a reduction in governmental financial assistance including medicare and medicaid  competition and  governmental regulation and litigation bridge and toll road issuers are subject to certain risks including  increases in fuel costs  competition from tollfree vehicular bridges and  alternate modes of transportation  a reduction in the availability of fuel and  government regulation  state specific risk  because the portfolio is concentrated in bonds located in new jersey there may be more risk than if the bonds were issued by issuers located in several states the financial condition of new jersey is affected by various national and local economic social and environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the value of the units  constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations  the state is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and

long term return estimated current return equals the estimated annual cash to be received from the bonds in a portfolio less estimated annual portfolio expenses divided by the unit price including the maximum sales charge estimated annual  estimated interest income annual expenses  unit price estimated long term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a portfolio unlike estimated current return estimated long term return reflects maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds in a portfolio it is an average of the yields to maturity or in certain cases to an earlier call date of the individual bonds in the portfolio adjusted to reflect a portfolios maximum sales charge and estimated expenses we calculate the average yield for a portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its market value and the time remaining to the call or maturity date the return quotations are designed to be comparative rather than predictive and your actual return will vary with unit price how long you hold your investment and changes in a portfolio interest income and expenses yields on individual bonds depend on many factors including the general condition of the bond market the size of a particular offering and the maturity and quality rating of the particular issues yields can vary among bonds with similar maturities coupons and ratings see estimated long term

general matter neither the issuer nor the sponsor has obtained insurance with respect to many of the bonds in any traditional portfolio the trustee has delivered to the sponsor registered units which represent ownership of the entire portfolio and which are offered for sale by this prospectus each unit of a portfolio represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of such portfolio units may only be sold in states in which they are registered to the extent that any units of any portfolio are redeemed by the trustee the aggregate value of the portfolios assets will decrease by the amount paid to the redeeming unitholder but the fractional undivided interest of each unredeemed unit in such portfolio will increase proportionately the sponsor will initially and from time to time thereafter hold units in connection with their offering objectives of the portfolios the objectives of the portfolios are income exempt from federal income tax and in the case of state portfolios where applicable state income and intangibles taxes and conservation of capital through an investment in obligations issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the united

of this prospectus the portfolios may contain or be concentrated in one or more of the types of bonds discussed below the following paragraphs briefly discuss certain circumstances which may adversely affect the ability of issuers of bonds held in a portfolio to make payments of principal and interest or the ratings of such bonds for economic risks specific to the individual portfolios see part a of this prospectus and the appendices to the information supplement of this prospectus escrow secured obligations are typically secured by direct obligations of the us government or in some cases obligations guaranteed by the us government placed in an escrow account maintained by an independent trustee until maturity or a predetermined redemption date these obligations are generally noncallable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date in a few isolated instances however bonds which were thought to be escrowed to maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity health care facility obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from services provided by hospitals or other health care facilities including nursing homes the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels of the facility demand for services wages of employees overhead expenses competition from other similar providers government regulation the cost of malpractice insurance and the degree of governmental financial assistance including medicare and medicaid housing obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing projects for low to moderate income families housing obligations are generally prepayable at any time and therefore their average life will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels rental income mortgage default rates taxes operating expenses governmental regulations and the appropriation of subsidies industrial revenue obligations are industrial revenue bonds irbs including pollution control revenue bonds which are taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects debt service payment on irbs is dependent upon various factors including the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project expenses associated with the project and regulatory and environmental restrictions utility obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of several types of energy including electric and natural gas the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including the rates for electricity and natural gas the demand for electricity and natural gas the degree of competition governmental regulation overhead expenses and variable costs such as fuel transportation facility revenue obligations are obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of airports public transit systems and ports the ability of issuers to make debt service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations under these use agreements bonds that are secured primarily by the revenue collected by a public transit system typically are additionally secured by a pledge of sales tax receipts collected at the state or local level or of other governmental financial assistance the revenue of issuers of transit system obligations will be affected by variations in utilization which in turn may be affected by the degree of local governmental subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive their revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the facilities which may fluctuate depending on the local economy and on competition from competing forms of transportation such as air rail and trucks the revenues of issuers which derive their payments from bridge road or tunnel toll revenues could be adversely affected by increases in fuel costs competition from tollfree vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes of transportation water andor sewerage obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are payable from user fees from the sale of water andor sewerage services the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain rate increases population declines the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulties obtaining new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and nogrowth zoning ordinances university and college revenue obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived mainly from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems faced by such issuers include declines in the number of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers dedicatedtax supported obligations are obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by tax revenues from a designated source which revenues are pledged to secure the bonds the various types of bonds described  below differ in structure and with respect to the rights of the bondholders to the underlying property each type of dedicatedtax supported bond has distinct risks only some of which are set forth below one type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by the incremental tax received on either real property or on sales within a specifically defined geographical area such tax generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the underlying property or revenues another type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by a special tax levied on real property within a defined geographical area in such a manner that the tax is levied on those who benefit from the project such bonds typically provide for a statutory lien on the underlying property for unpaid taxes a third type of dedicatedtax supported bond may be secured by a tax levied upon the manufacture sale or consumption of commodities or upon the license to pursue certain occupations or upon corporate privileges within a taxing jurisdiction as to any of these types of bonds the ability of the designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such bonds may be affected by changes in the local economy the financial success of the enterprise responsible for the payment of the taxes the value of any property on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in a timely fashion each of these factors will have a different affect on each distinct type of dedicatedtax supported bonds municipal lease obligations are obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity and are normally subject to annual budget appropriations of the leasing governmental entity a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby market discounts or premiums certain of the bonds may have been deposited at a market discount or premium principally because their interest rates are lower or higher than prevailing rates on comparable securities the current returns of market discount securities are lower than comparably rated securities selling at par because discount securities tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity the current returns of market premium securities are higher than comparably rated securities selling at par because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity because part of the purchase price is returned through current income payments and not at maturity an early redemption at par of a premium security will result in a reduction in yield to a portfolio market premium or discount attributable to interest rate changes does not indicate market confidence or lack of confidence in the issue original issue discount obligations and stripped obligations are bonds which were issued with nominal interest rates less than the rates then offered by comparable securities and as a consequence were originally sold at a discount from their face or par values in a stable interest rate environment the market value of an original issue discount bond would tend to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bond approached maturity certain of the original issue discount obligations in a portfolio may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment of the face amount of the bond at its maturity zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality that pay interest currently original issue discount obligations including zero coupon bonds may be subject to redemption at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption the accreted value plus if applicable some premium pursuant to such call provisions an original issue discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than its face value see the schedule of investments appearing in part a of this prospectus for more information about the call provisions of portfolio bonds certain of the bonds in a portfolio may be stripped obligations which represent evidences of ownership with respect to either the principal amount of or a payment of interest on a taxexempt obligation stripped obligations each stripped obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount payable at maturity a stripped obligation therefore has economic characteristics similar to zero coupon bonds as described above unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the state and local tax consequences of owning original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations under applicable provisions governing determination of state and local taxes interest on original issue discount obligations or stripped obligations may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there is no corresponding cash payment composition of portfolios each portfolio initially consists of delivery statements relating to contracts to purchase bonds or of such bonds as are listed under schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus and thereafter of such bonds as may continue to be held from time to time including certain securities deposited in the portfolio in substitution for bonds not delivered to a  portfolio or in exchange or substitution for bonds upon certain refundings together with accrued and undistributed interest thereon and undistributed cash realized from the disposition of bonds whenissued and delayed delivery transactions the contracts to purchase bonds delivered to the trustee represent an obligation by issuers or dealers to deliver bonds to the sponsor for deposit in the portfolios certain of the contracts relate to bonds which have not been issued as of the date of deposit and which are commonly referred to as when issued or when as and if issued bonds although the sponsor believes it unlikely if such bonds or replacement bonds described below are not acquired by a portfolio or if their delivery is delayed the estimated current returns and estimated long term returns shown in part a of this prospectus may be reduced certain of the contracts for the purchase of bonds provide for delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit interest on such when issued and delayed delivery bonds accrues to the benefit of unitholders commencing with the first settlement date for the units however in the opinion of counsel unitholders who purchase their units prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee must reduce the tax basis of their units for interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of units and the delivery of the bonds because such amounts constitute a return of principal as a result of such adjustment the estimated current returns set forth in part a of the prospectus which are based on the public offering price as of the business day prior to the date of deposit may be slightly lower than that which unitholders will receive after the first year assuming the portfolio does not change and estimated annual expense does not vary from that set forth in part a of the prospectus those bonds in each portfolio purchased with delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit are so noted in the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus limited replacement of certain bonds neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any bond in the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for a portfolio under a contract including those bonds purchased on a when as and if issued basis failed bonds the sponsor is authorized under the indenture to direct the trustee to acquire other specified bonds replacement bonds to make up the original corpus of the portfolio within  days after delivery of notice of the failed contract and the cost to the portfolio exclusive of accrued interest may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed bonds the replacement bonds must satisfy the criteria previously described for the portfolios and shall be substantially identical to the failed bonds they replace in terms of i the exemption from federal and state taxation ii maturity and iii cost to the portfolio in addition replacement bonds shall not be when as and if issued bonds whenever a replacement bond has been acquired for a portfolio the trustee shall within five days after the delivery thereof mail or deliver a notice of such acquisition to all unitholders of the portfolio involved once the original corpus of the portfolio is acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investment of the portfolio to the extent replacement bonds are not acquired the sponsor shall refund to all unitholders of the portfolio involved the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds not replaced and the principal and accrued interest attributable to such bonds shall be distributed not more than  days after the determination of such failure or at such earlier time as the trustee in its sole discretion deems to be in the interest of the unitholders any such accrued interest paid to unitholders will be paid by the sponsor and accordingly will not be treated as taxexempt income in the event failed bonds in a portfolio could not be replaced the net annual interest income per unit for such portfolio would be reduced and the estimated current return thereon might be lowered sale maturity and redemption of bonds certain of the bonds may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms the proceeds from such events will be used to pay for units redeemed or distributed to unitholders and not reinvested accordingly no assurance can be given that a portfolio will retain for any length of time its present size and composition all of the bonds in each portfolio are subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions described in the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus and in most cases pursuant to a sinking fund or special or extraordinary redemption provisions see the discussion of the various types of bond issues above for information on the call provisions of such bonds particularly single family mortgage revenue bonds certain bonds may carry a mandatory put also referred to as a mandatory tender or mandatory repurchase feature pursuant to which the holder of such bonds will receive payment of the full principal amount thereof on a stated date prior to the maturity date unless such holder affirmatively acts to retain the bond the trustee does not have the authority to act to retain bonds with such features accordingly it will receive payment of the full principal amount of any such bonds on the stated put date and such date is therefore treated as the maturity date of such bonds in selecting bonds for the respective portfolios and for purposes of calculating the average maturity of the bonds in any portfolio the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent  interest distributions it may also affect the current return on units of the portfolio involved the exercise of redemption or call provisions is more likely to occur in situations where the bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par as opposed to a discount from par in the case of original issue discount bonds such redemption is generally to be made at the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to the date of redemption such price is referred to herein as accreted value because bonds may have been valued at prices above or below par value or the then current accreted value at the time units were purchased unitholders may realize gain or loss upon the redemption of portfolio bonds see tax status and distributions to unitholders and the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus legislation at any time after the initial date of deposit legislation may be enacted with respect to the bonds in a portfolio or the issuers of the bonds changing approaches to regulation particularly with respect to the environment may have a negative impact on certain companies represented in a portfolio there can be no assurance that future legislation regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on a portfolio or will not impair the ability of the issuers of the bonds to meet their obligations certain tax matters litigation certain of the bonds in a portfolio may be subject to continuing requirements regarding the actual use of bond proceeds the manner of operation of the project financed from bond proceeds or the rebate of excess earnings on bond proceeds any of which may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal income taxation although at the time of issuance of each of the bonds in each portfolio an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on such obligations from federal income taxation and the issuers covenanted to comply with all requirements necessary to retain the taxexempt status of the bonds there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements established upon issuance of the bonds a failure to comply with such requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations is subject to federal income taxation perhaps even retroactively from the date of issuance of such bonds thereby reducing the value of the bonds and subjecting unitholders to unanticipated tax liabilities to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any of the portfolios it is possible that after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated with respect to bonds in any portfolio any such litigation may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxexempt nature of the interest thereon but while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted the opinions of bond counsel to the issuer of each bond on the date of issuance state that such bonds were validly issued and that the interest thereon is to the extent indicated exempt from federal income tax insurance on the bonds the bonds in the insured portfolios are covered by insurance policies obtained by the sponsor or

they do business by state insurance commissioners who regulate the standards of solvency which must be maintained the nature of and limitations on investments reports of financial condition and requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums losses and other matters a significant portion of the assets of insurance companies is required by law to be held in reserve against potential

medical care costs minimum standards for nofault automobile insurance national health insurance tax law changes affecting life insurance companies and repeal of the antitrust exemption for the insurance business can significantly impact the insurance business the above ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold the bonds and such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies any downward revision or withdrawal of either or both ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the bonds see the information supplement for further information concerning insurance because the insurance on the bonds if any will be effective so long as the bonds are outstanding such insurance will be taken into account in determining the market value of the bonds and therefore some value attributable to such insurance will be included in the value of the units of the insured portfolios the insurance does not however guarantee the market value of the bonds or of the units public offering price the public offering price of the units of each portfolio is equal to the trustees determination of the aggregate offering prices of the bonds deposited therein minus any advancement to the principal account of the portfolio made by the trustee plus a sales charge set forth in part a of this prospectus in each case adding to the total thereof cash held by the portfolio minus accrued expenses and any advances to the portfolio made by the trustee if any and dividing the sum so obtained by the number of units outstanding in the portfolio see unit value and evaluationin addition a portion of the public offering price during the initial offering period also consists of cash andor bonds in an amount sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a portfolio including costs for preparing the registration statement the trust indenture and other closing documents registering units with the securities and exchange commission and states the initial audit of each portfolio the initial evaluation legal fees the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and any nonmaterial outofpocket expenses if bonds are purchased with the portion of the public offering price intended to be used to reimburse the sponsor for the portfolios organization costs such bonds will be purchased in the same proportionate relationship as all the bonds contained in the portfolio these bonds will be sold to reimburse the sponsor for the portfolios organization costs at the earlier of six months after the initial date of deposit or the end of the initial offering period a shorter time period than the life of the portfolio also any cash reserved for these purposes will be paid to the sponsor at the earlier of six months after the initial date of deposit or the end of the initial offering period during the period ending with the earlier of six months  after the initial date of deposit or the end of the initial offering period there may be a decrease in the value of the bonds to the extent the proceeds from the sale of these bonds and any cash reserved are insufficient to repay the sponsor for the portfolio organization costs the trustee will sell additional bonds to allow the portfolio to fully reimburse the sponsor in that event the net asset value per unit will be reduced by the amount of additional bonds sold although the dollar amount of the reimbursement due to the sponsor will remain fixed and will never exceed the amount per unit set forth for the portfolio in part a of the prospectus this will result in a greater effective cost per unit to unitholders for the reimbursement to the sponsor see unit value and evaluation the sales charge applicable to quantity purchases is reduced on a graduated scale for sales to any purchaser of at least  or  units and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the purchaser for purposes of calculating the applicable sales charge purchasers who have indicated their intent to purchase a specified amount of units of any portfolio in the primary or secondary offering period by executing and delivering a letter of intent to the sponsor which letter of intent must be in a form acceptable to the sponsor and shall have a maximum duration of thirteen months will be eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the following tables based on the amount of intended aggregate purchases as expressed in the letter of intent due to administrative limitations and in order to permit adequate tracking the only secondary market purchases that will be permitted to be applied toward the intended specified amount and that will receive the corresponding reduced sales charge are those units that are acquired through or from the sponsor by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder agrees that the first purchase of units following the execution of such letter of intent will be at least  of the total amount of the intended aggregate purchases expressed in such unitholders letter of intent further through the establishment of the letter of intent such unitholder agrees that units representing  of the total amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the trustee pending completion of these purchases all distributions on units held in escrow will be credited to such unitholders account if total purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a unitholders letter of intent the units held in escrow will be transferred to such unitholders account a unitholder who purchases units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of units specified in a unitholders letter of intent the amount of which would cause the unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge reduction will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the purchase of units which caused the unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of units during the letter of intent period if the total purchases are less than the amount specified the unitholder involved must pay the sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied the unitholder will however be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level if such unitholder does not pay the additional amount within  days after written request by the sponsor or the unitholders securities representative the sponsor will instruct the trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed units to meet the required payment by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder irrevocably appoints the sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of such unitholders escrowed units with full power of substitution in the premises a unitholder or his securities representative must notify the sponsor whenever such unitholder makes a purchase of units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended amount sales

the portfolio a sales charge determined in accordance with the table set forth below based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity of each such bond see unit value and evaluation the effect of this method of sales charge calculation will be that different sales charge rates will be applied to the various bonds in a portfolio based upon the maturities of such bonds as shown the sales

percent of the net amount invested expressed as a percent of the public offering price the maximum sales charge on a portfolio for instance one consisting entirely of bonds with  years or more to maturity would be   of the net amount invested the actual secondary market sales charge included in the public offering price of any particular portfolio will depend on the maturities of the bonds in the portfolio pursuant to the terms of the indenture the trustee may terminate a portfolio if the net asset value of such portfolio as shown by any evaluation is less than  of the original principal amount of the portfolio at all times while units are being offered for sale the sponsor will appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the underlying bonds in each trust as of  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the new york stock exchange the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time and will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such appraisal such public offering price will be effective for all orders received by a dealer or the sponsor at or prior to  pm eastern time on each such day or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time orders received after that time or on a day when the exchange is closed for a scheduled holiday or weekend will be held until the next determination of price accrued interest from the preceding record date to but not including the settlement date of the transaction three business days after purchase will be added to the public offering price to determine the purchase price of units see accrued interest the graduated sales charges set forth above will apply on all applicable purchases of nuveen investment company securities on any one day by the same purchaser in the amounts stated and for this purpose purchases of this series will be aggregated with concurrent purchases of any other series or of shares of any openend management investment company of which the sponsor is principal underwriter and with respect to the purchase of which a sales charge is imposed purchases by or for the account of individuals and their spouses parents children grandchildren grandparents parentsinlaw sons and daughtersinlaw siblings a siblings spouse and a spouses siblings immediate family members will be aggregated to determine the applicable sales charge the graduated sales charges are also applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single

reduced sales charges provided in the table above for wrap account purchases notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this prospectus investors who purchase units as described in this paragraph will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases the initial or primary public offering price of the units in each portfolio is based upon a pro rata share of the offering prices per unit of the bonds in such portfolio plus the applicable sales charge the secondary market public offering price of each portfolio is based upon a pro rata share of the bid prices per unit of the bonds in such portfolio plus the applicable sales charge the offering prices of bonds in a portfolio may be expected to average between  to  more than the bid prices of such bonds the difference between the bid side evaluation and the offering side evaluation of the bonds in each portfolio on the business day prior to the date of deposit is shown in the discussion of each portfolio whether or not units are being offered for sale the trustee will determine the aggregate value of each portfolio as of  pm eastern time i on each june  or december  or if such date is not a business day the last business day prior thereto ii on any day on which a unit is tendered for redemption or the next succeeding business day if the date of tender is a nonbusiness day and iii at such other times as may be necessary for this purpose a business day shall be any day on which the exchange is normally open see unit value and evaluation market for units during the initial public offering period the sponsor intends to offer to purchase units of each portfolio at a price equivalent to the pro rata share per unit of the offering prices of the bonds in such portfolio plus accrued interest afterward although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for units of each portfolio at its own expense and to continuously offer to purchase units of each portfolio at prices subject to change at any time which are based upon the bid prices of bonds in the respective portfolios during the period ending with the earlier of six months after the initial date of deposit or the end of the initial offering period the price at which the sponsor expects to repurchase units the sponsors repurchase price includes estimated organization costs per unit after such period the sponsors repurchase price will not include such estimated organization costs see part a of the prospectus unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of the trustee or their broker as to the current redemption price see redemption in connection with its secondary marketmaking activities the sponsor may from time to time enter into secondary market joint account agreements with other brokers and dealers pursuant to such an agreement the sponsor will purchase units from the broker or dealer at the bid price and will place the units into a joint account managed by the sponsor sales from the account will be made in accordance with the then current prospectus and the sponsor and the broker or dealer will share profits and losses in the joint account in accordance with the terms of their joint account agreement in maintaining a market for the units the sponsor will realize profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which units are purchased and the price at which units are resold or redeemed the secondary market public offering price of units may be greater or less than the cost of such units to the sponsor certificates if any for units are delivered to the purchaser as promptly after the date of settlement three business days after purchase as the trustee can complete the mechanics of registration normally within  hours after registration instructions are received purchasers of units to whom certificates are issued will be unable to exercise any right of redemption until they have received their certificates properly endorsed for transfer see redemption accrued interest accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on bonds in each portfolio is accounted for daily on an accrual basis for this reason the purchase price of units of a portfolio will include not only the public offering price but also the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement accrued interest does not include accrual of original issue discount on zero coupon bonds stripped obligations or other original issue discount bonds interest accrues to the benefit of unitholders commencing with the settlement date of their purchase transaction in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest that investors would have to pay in addition to the public offering price the trustee has agreed to advance to each portfolio the amount of accrued interest due on the bonds as of the date of  deposit which has been designated the first record date for all plans of distribution this accrued interest will be paid to the sponsor as the holder of record of all units on the date of deposit consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the date of deposit to but not including the date of settlement of the investors purchase three business days after purchase less any distributions from the related interest account the trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other cost to the portfolios from interest received on the bonds deposited in each portfolio the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in the portfolios since municipal bond interest is accrued daily but paid only semiannually during the initial months of the portfolios the interest accounts consisting of accrued but uncollected interest and collected interest cash will be predominantly the uncollected accrued interest that is not available for distribution however due to advances by the trustee the trustee will provide a first distribution between approximately  and  days after the date of deposit assuming each portfolio retains its original size and composition and expenses and fees remain the same annual interest collected and distributed will approximate the estimated net annual interest income stated in part a of the prospectus however the amount of accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount that the trustee will have actually received and distributed to the unitholders therefore there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is included in the purchase price and the redemption price of the units interest is accounted for daily and a proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest computed from the preceding record date is added to the daily valuation of each unit of each portfolio see part a of the prospectus and distributions to unitholders as bonds mature or are redeemed or sold the accrued interest applicable to such bonds is collected and subsequently distributed to unitholders unitholders who sell or redeem all or a portion of their units will be paid their proportionate share of the remaining accrued interest to but not including the third business day following the date of sale or tender estimated long term return and estimated current return the estimated long term return for each portfolio is a measure of the return to the investor expected to be earned over the estimated life of the portfolio the estimated long term return represents an average of the yields to maturity or call of the bonds in the portfolio calculated in accordance with accepted bond practice and adjusted to reflect expenses and sales charges under accepted bond practice taxexempt bonds are customarily offered to investors on a yield price basis which involves computation of yield to maturity or to an earlier call date whichever produces the lower yield and which takes into account not only the interest payable on the bonds but also the amortization or accretion of any premium over or discount from the par maturity value inherent in the bonds purchase price in the calculation of estimated long term return the average yield for a portfolio is derived by weighting each bonds yield by the market value of the bond and by the amount of time remaining to the date to which the bond is priced this weighted average yield is then adjusted to reflect estimated expenses is compounded and is reduced by a factor which represents the amortization of the sales charge over the expected average life of a portfolio the estimated long term return calculation does not take into account the effect of a first distribution which may be less than a regular distribution or may be paid at some point after  days or a second distribution which may be less than a normal distribution for unitholders who choose quarterly or semiannual plans of distribution and it also does not take into account the difference in timing of payments to unitholders who choose quarterly or semiannual plans of distribution each of which will reduce the return estimated current return is computed by dividing the net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price in contrast to estimated long term return estimated current return does not reflect the amortization of premium or accretion of discount if any on the bonds in a portfolio net annual interest income per unit is calculated by dividing the annual interest income to a portfolio less estimated expenses by the number of units outstanding net annual interest income per unit used to calculate estimated current return will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trustee and the evaluator and with the redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds a unitholders actual return may vary significantly from the estimated longterm return based on their holding period market interest rate changes other factors affecting the prices of individual bonds in the portfolio and differences between the expected remaining life of portfolio bonds and the actual length of time that they remain in a portfolio such actual holding periods may be reduced by termination of a portfolio as described in other information since both the estimated current return and the estimated long term return quoted in part a of the prospectus are based on the market value of the underlying bonds on the business day prior to the date of deposit subsequent calculations of these performance measures will reflect the then current market value of the underlying bonds and may be higher or lower the sponsor will provide estimated cash flow information relating to a portfolio without charge to each potential investor in a portfolio who receives this prospectus and makes an oral or written request to the sponsor for such information  a portion of the monies received by a portfolio may be treated in the first year only as a return of principal due to the inclusion in the portfolio of whenissued or other bonds having delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit a consequence of this treatment is that in the computation of estimated current return for the first year such monies are excluded from net annual interest income and treated as an adjustment to the public offering price see part a of the prospectus composition of portfolios and tax status a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns and taxableequivalent returns on a portfolio and returns over specified periods on other similar nuveen portfolios with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the portfolio us government bonds for example are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and bank cds and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal government money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal but pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the shortterm debt market the investment characteristics of the portfolios are described more fully elsewhere in the prospectus evaluation of bonds at the date of deposit the prices at which the bonds deposited in the portfolios would have been offered to the public on the business day prior to the date of deposit were determined by the trustee on the basis of an evaluation of such bonds prepared by kenny sp evaluation services a division of j j kenny co inc kenny sp a firm regularly engaged in the business of evaluating quoting or appraising comparable bonds with respect to bonds in insured portfolios and insured bonds in traditional portfolios kenny sp evaluated the bonds as so insured see insurance on the bonds the amount by which the trustees determination of the offering prices of the bonds deposited in the portfolios was greater or less than the cost of such bonds to the sponsor was profit or loss to the sponsor exclusive of any underwriting profit see part a of the prospectus the sponsor also may realize further profit or sustain further loss as a result of fluctuations in the public offering price of the units cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the settlement date for a purchase of units or prior to the acquisition of all portfolio securities by a portfolio may be available for use in the sponsors business and may be of benefit to the sponsor tax status at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition with respect to state portfolios where applicable bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest on such bonds when held by residents of the state in which the issuers of such bonds are located from state income taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes for a discussion of the tax status of state portfolios see part a of this prospectus neither the sponsor nor chapman and cutler has made any review of the portfolios proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date of which interest is determined to be taxable gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unitholder is includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the portfolios is debt the interest on which is excluded for federal income tax purposes in the opinion of chapman and cutler counsel to the sponsor under existing law as of the date of this prospectus  the portfolios are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which is excludable from gross income under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code will retain its status for federal income tax purposes when received by the portfolios and when distributed to the unitholders however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches of foreign corporations see certain tax matters applicable to corporate unitholders below  each unitholder of a portfolio is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset of such portfolio under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when such portfolio disposes  of a bond or when the unitholder redeems or sells units if the unitholder disposes of a unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all the assets of the portfolio involved including his pro rata portion of all the bonds represented by the unit the taxpayer relief act of  includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain eg short sales offsetting notional principal contracts futures or forward contracts or similar transactions as constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain but not loss and for purposes of determining the holding period unitholders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to any such constructive sales rules unitholders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective portfolio if any on bonds delivered after the date the unitholders pay for their units to the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds before the date the portfolio acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller and consequently such unitholders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment at maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unitholder subject to various nonrecognition provisions of the code the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unitholders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unitholders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unitholder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the portfolio assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unitholder realizing a taxable gain when his or her units are sold or redeemed for an amount less than or equal to their original cost unitholders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the calculation of basis and  any amounts paid on defaulted bonds held by the trustee under policies of insurance issued with respect to such bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bonds on the date a unitholder acquires his units and the price the unitholder pays for his units unitholders should consult with their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application the revenue reconciliation act of  the  tax act subjects taxexempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to a statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price the portfolio pays for the bonds or the price a unitholder pays for his or her units under the  tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while the portfolio holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unitholders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unitholder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a portfolio is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal  residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units would generally not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of such units in the case of certain of the bonds in the portfolio the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes that he or she may be a substantial user or a related person as so defined should contact his or her tax adviser certain tax matters applicable to corporate unitholders in the case of certain corporations the alternative minimum tax and the superfund tax for taxable years beginning after december   depend upon the corporations alternative

respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities neither the sponsor nor chapman and cutler has made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for such opinions for taxpayers other than corporations net capital gain is subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate of   in the case of certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less the date on which a unit is acquired ie the trade date is excluded for purposes for determining the holding period of the unit capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income in addition please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are considered conversion transactions effective for transactions entered into after april   unitholders and prospective investors should consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this provision on their investment in units for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations interest on certain private activity bonds which includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds issued on or after august   is included as an item of tax preference however the assets of the portfolio do not include any such private activity bonds issued on or after that date in general section  of the code provides that  of social security benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of the social security benefits received exceeds a base amount the base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including taxexempt interest to the extent that social security benefits are includible in gross income they will be treated as any other item of gross income in addition under the  tax act for taxable years beginning after december   up to  of social security benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of social security benefits received exceeds an adjusted base amount the adjusted base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns although taxexempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion if any of social security benefits will be included in gross income no taxexempt interest including that received from the portfolios will be subject to tax a taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base  amount or the adjusted base amount must include  or  respectively of his social security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives any taxexempt interest a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income after inclusion of taxexempt interest does not exceed the base amount need not include any social security benefits in gross income ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain taxpayers including without limitation corporations subject to the branch profits tax financial institutions certain insurance companies certain s corporations individual recipients of social security or railroad retirement benefits and taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred or continued indebtedness to purchase or carry taxexempt obligations prospective investors should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences except as noted above and in part a of this prospectus the exemption of interest on state and local obligations for

in a portfolio for that portion of the portfolio that represents a particular plan of distribution provided however that for services performed prior to the record date for the second distribution from the interest account the trustees compensation shall be computed in respect of all units outstanding at the rate specified for the monthly plan of distribution the trustees compensation and the sponsors evaluation fee with respect to each portfolio is computed on the basis of the largest principal amount of bonds in the portfolio at any time during the period with respect to which such compensation is being computed the trustees fee may be periodically adjusted in response to fluctuations in shortterm interest rates reflecting the cost to the trustee of advancing funds to a portfolio to meet scheduled distributions in addition the sponsors evaluation fee and the trustees fee may be adjusted in accordance with the cumulative percentage increase of the united states

each case as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each unit of a portfolio outstanding and a year to date summary of all distributions paid on said units within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a registered unitholder of a portfolio a statement with respect to such

share of each unit outstanding each annual statement will reflect pertinent information in respect of all plans of distribution so that unitholders may be informed regarding the results of other plans of distribution unit value and evaluation the value of each portfolio is determined by the trustee on the basis of  the cash on hand in the portfolio or moneys in the process of being collected  the value of the bonds in the portfolio based on the bid prices of the bonds and  interest accrued thereon not subject to collection less  amounts representing taxes or governmental charges payable out of the portfolio  amounts representing unpaid organization costs and  the accrued expenses of the portfolio the result of such computation is divided by the number of units of such portfolio outstanding as of the date thereof to determine the per unit value unit value of such portfolio the sponsor may determine the value of the bonds in each portfolio  on the basis of current bid prices of the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by a portfolio  if bid prices are not available for any of the bonds on the basis of bid prices for comparable bonds  by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluating quoting or appraising comparable bonds or  by any combination of the above although the unit value of each portfolio is based on the bid prices of the bonds the units are sold initially to the public in the primary market at the public offering price based on the offering prices of the bonds  because the insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the issuers of bonds with respect to the bonds in the insured portfolios and with respect to insured bonds in traditional portfolios is effective so long as such bonds are outstanding such insurance will be taken into account in determining the bid and offering prices of such bonds and therefore some value attributable to such insurance will be included in the value of units of portfolios that include such bonds distribution of units to the public nuveen in addition to being the sponsor is the sole underwriter of the units it is the intention of the sponsor to qualify units of national long intermediate intermediate short intermediate and short term portfolios for sale under the laws of substantially all of the states of the

portfolios it is the practice of the sponsor to place all of the units as collateral for a letter or letters of credit from one or more commercial banks under an agreement to release such units from time to time as needed for distribution under such an arrangement the sponsor pays such banks compensation based on the then current interest rate this is a normal warehousing arrangement during the period of distribution of the units to public investors to facilitate the handling of transactions sales of units shall be limited to transactions involving a minimum of either  or  units whichever is less the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units the sponsor plans to allow a discount to brokers and dealers in connection with the primary

to the trustee in order for a replacement certificate to be issued although at the date hereof no charge is made and none is contemplated a unitholder may be required to pay  to the trustee for each certificate reissued or transfer of units requested and to pay any governmental charge which may be imposed in connection therewith replacement of lost stolen or destroyed certificates to obtain a new certificate replacing one that has been lost stolen or destroyed the unitholder must furnish the trustee with sufficient indemnification and pay such expenses as the trustee may incur this indemnification must be in the form of an open penalty bond of indemnification the premium for such an indemnity bond may vary but currently  amounts to  of the market value of the units represented by the certificate in the case however of a portfolio as to which notice of termination has been given the premium currently amounts to  of the market value of the units represented by such

equal to the unit value of such portfolio determined by the trustee as of  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time on the date of tender as defined hereafter plus accrued interest to but not including the third business day after the date of tender redemption price during the period ending with the earlier of six months after the initial date of deposit or the end of the initial offering period the redemption price per unit includes estimated organization costs per unit after such period the redemption price will not include such estimated organization costs see part a of the prospectus the price received upon redemption may be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the bonds on the date of tender unitholders should check with the trustee or their broker to determine the redemption price before tendering units the date of tender is deemed to be the date on which the request for redemption of units is received in proper form by the trustee except that as regards a redemption request received after  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time or on any day on which the exchange is normally closed the date of tender is the next day on which such exchange is normally open for trading and such request will be deemed to have been made on such day and the redemption will be effected at the redemption price computed on that day accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the interest account of the appropriate portfolio or if the balance therein is insufficient from the principal account of such portfolio all other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the principal account the trustee is empowered to sell underlying bonds of a portfolio in order to make funds available for redemption see removal of bonds from the portfolios units so redeemed shall be cancelled to the extent that bonds are sold from a portfolio the size and diversity of such portfolio will be reduced such sales may be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the redemption price is determined on the basis of the bid prices of the bonds in each portfolio while the initial public offering price of units will be determined on the basis of the offering prices of the bonds as of  pm eastern time on any day on which the exchange is normally open for trading or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time as of any given time the difference between the bid and offering prices of such bonds may be expected to average  to  of principal amount in the case of actively traded bonds the difference may be as little as  to  of  and in the case of inactively traded bonds such difference usually will not exceed   the right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period during which the securities and exchange commission determines that trading in the municipal bond market is restricted or an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable or for such other periods as the securities and exchange commission may by order permit under regulations issued by the internal revenue service the trustee will be required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholders tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations any amount so withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing his or her tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker at the time the certificate or book entry return confirmation is issued and this number is printed on the certificate or book entry return confirmation and on distribution statements if a unitholders tax identification number does not appear as described above or if it is incorrect the unitholder should contact the trustee before redeeming units to determine what action if any is required to avoid this backup withholding how units may be purchased by the sponsor the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price it may purchase such units by notifying the trustee before the close of business on the second succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the unitholder not later than the day on which payment would otherwise have been made by the trustee see redemption the sponsors current practice is to bid at the redemption price in the secondary market units held by the sponsor may be tendered to the trustee for redemption as any other units how bonds may be removed from the portfolios bonds will be removed from a portfolio as they mature or are redeemed by the issuers thereof see risk factors in part a of this prospectus and summary of portfolios herein for a discussion of call provisions of portfolio bonds the indenture also empowers the trustee to sell bonds for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which income may not be available under the indenture the sponsor is obligated to provide the trustee with a current list of bonds in each portfolio to be sold in such circumstances in deciding which bonds should be sold the sponsor intends to consider among other things such factors as  market conditions  market prices of the bonds  the effect on income distributions to unitholders of the sale of various bonds  the effect on principal amount of underlying bonds per unit of the sale of various bonds  the financial condition of the issuers and  the effect of the sale of various bonds on the investment character of the portfolio such sales if required could result in the sale of bonds by the trustee at prices less than original cost to the portfolio to the extent bonds are sold the size and diversity of such portfolio will be reduced in addition the sponsor is empowered to direct the trustee to liquidate bonds upon the happening of certain other events such as default in the payment of principal andor interest an action of the issuer that will adversely affect its ability to continue payment of the principal of and interest on its bonds or an adverse change in market revenue or credit factors affecting the investment character of the bonds if a default in the payment of the principal of andor interest on any of the bonds occurs and if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee whether to sell or continue to hold such bonds within

portfolios are rated by one of the rating agencies provided below the following descriptions are published by the rating agencies  standard  poors corporation the following is a brief description of the applicable standard  poors rating symbols and their meanings a standard  poors rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this assessment may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaaan obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on an obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highest rated issues only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings the letter p indicates that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project note ratings a standard  poors note rating reflects the liquidity concerns and market access risks unique to notes notes due in  years or less will likely receive a note rating notes maturing beyond  years will most likely receive a longterm debt rating note rating symbols are as follows sp very strong or strong capacity to pay principal and interest those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety characteristics will be given a plus  designation sp satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes moodys investors service inc the following is a description of the applicable moodys investors service inc rating symbols and their meanings aaabonds that are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of  protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well con bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally these are bonds secured by a earnings of projects under construction b earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience c rentals which begin when facilities are completed or d payments to which some other limiting condition attaches parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis of condition note ratings mig  this designation denotes best quality there is present strong protection by established cash flows superior liquidity support or demonstrated broadbased access to the market for refinancing mig  this designation denotes high quality margins of protection are ample although not so large as in the preceding group fitch ibca inc formerly fitch investors service lp the following is a brief description of the applicable fitch ibca inc rating symbols and their meanings aaaaaa ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk they are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events aaaa ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk they indicate very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events aa ratings denote a low expectation of credit risk the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered strong this capacity may nevertheless be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings bbbbbb ratings indicate that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity this is the lowest investmentgrade category to provide more detailed indications of credit quality the aa a and bbb ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within these major rating categories note ratings f indicates the best capacity for timely payment of financial commitments may have an added  to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature f good credit quality a satisfactory capacity for timely payment of financial commitments but the margin of safety is not as great as in the case of the higher ratings other information amendment of indenture the indenture may be amended by the trustee and the sponsor without the consent of any of the unitholders  to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision thereof which may be defective or inconsistent or  to make such other provisions as shall not adversely affect the unitholders provided however that the indenture may not be amended to increase the number of units in any portfolio or to permit the deposit or acquisition of bonds either in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds

certain circumstances and except as otherwise provided in the prospectus or the indenture the trustee shall advise the unitholders of any amendment promptly after execution thereof  termination of indenture each portfolio may be liquidated at any time by written consent of  of the unitholders or by the trustee when the value of such portfolio as shown by any evaluation is less than  of the original principal amount of such portfolio and will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that units not yet sold aggregating more than  of the units originally created are tendered for redemption by the sponsor thereby reducing the net worth of such portfolio to less than  of the principal amount of the bonds originally deposited in the portfolio the sale of bonds from the portfolios upon termination may result in realization of a lesser amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time for this reason among others the amount realized by a unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds originally represented by the units held by such unitholder the indenture will terminate upon the redemption sale or other disposition of the last bond held thereunder but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the calendar year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of its execution for national and state portfolios beyond the end of the calendar year preceding the twentieth anniversary of its execution for long intermediate and intermediate portfolios or beyond the end of the calendar year preceding the tenth anniversary of its execution for short intermediate and short term portfolios written notice of any termination specifying the time or times at which unitholders may surrender their

are allocable to such portfolios including estimated compensation of the trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges the trustee shall then distribute to unitholders of such portfolio their pro rata share of the balance of the interest and principal accounts with such distribution the unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution statement in substantially the same form as the annual distribution statement of the amount distributable at such time as the trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it shall make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner code of ethics the sponsor and the portfolios

low to moderate income families such issues are generally characterized by mandatory redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted value in the event of economic defaults and in the event of a failure of the operator of a project to comply with certain covenants as to the operation of the project the failure of such operator to comply with certain covenants related to the taxexempt status of interest on the bonds such as provisions requiring that a specified percentage of units be rented or available for rental to low or moderate income families potentially could cause interest on such bonds to be subject to federal income taxation from the date of issuance of the bonds the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and conditions affecting financed projects including among other things the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and adequate rental income employment and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets increases in taxes utility costs and other operating expenses the managerial ability of project managers changes in laws and governmental regulations the

purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period the redemption price of such issues may be more or less than the offering price of such bonds additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds single family  mortgage revenue bonds issued after

counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that such continuing

are taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects these projects are usually operated by corporate entities issuers are obligated only to pay amounts due on the irbs to the extent that funds are available from the unexpended proceeds of the irbs or receipts or revenues of the issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate operator of a project the arrangement may be in the form of a lease installment sale agreement conditional sale agreement or loan agreement but in each case the payments to the issuer are designed to be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator  of a project becoming highly leveraged which may have an impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected the irbs in a trust may be subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may provide for redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted value the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of irbs in a trust prior to the stated maturity of such bonds power revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from pollution control bonds as well as the sale of electric energy and oil and gas some of these obligations are backed by the credit of an investor owned utility iou the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the applicable public utility commissions the difficulty of financing large construction programs increased competition reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in a trust to make payments of principal and or interest on such bonds utility obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of natural gas or the combined net revenue of two or more municipal utility systems operating as a single entity the problems faced by such issuers include the

the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in a trust to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds transportation bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of airports public transit systems and ports the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for airport use occupancy of certain terminal space service fees and leases airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements the air transport industry is experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines are experiencing severe financial difficulties in particular facilities with use agreements involving airlines experiencing financial difficulty may experience a reduction in revenue due to the possible inability of these airlines to meet their use agreement obligations because of such financial difficulties and possible bankruptcy the sponsor cannot predict what effect these industry conditions may have on airport revenues which are dependent for payment on the financial condition of the airlines and their usage of the particular airport facility bonds that are secured primarily by the revenue collected by a public transit system typically are additionally secured by a pledge of sales tax receipts collected at the state or local level or of other governmental financial assistance transit system net revenues will be affected by variations in utilization which in turn may be affected by the degree of local governmental subsidization demographic and population shifts and competition from other forms of transportation and by increased costs including costs resulting from previous deferrals of maintenance port authorities derive their revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the facilities the rate of utilization of such facilities may fluctuate depending on the local economy and on competition from competing forms of transportation such as air rail and trucks water andor sewerage revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs

issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees education revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems of such issuers include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees bridge and tollroad revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which derive their payments from bridge road or tunnel toll revenues the revenues of such an issuer could be adversely affected by competition from tollfree vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes of transportation such revenues could also be adversely affected by a reduction in the availability of fuel to motorists or significant increases in the costs thereof specifically governmental regulations restricting the use of vehicles in the new york city metropolitan area may adversely affect revenues of the triborough bridge and tunnel authority dedicatedtax supported revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by tax revenues from a designated source which revenues are pledged to secure the bonds the various types of bonds described below differ in structure and with respect to the rights of the bondholders to the underlying property each type of dedicatedtax supported bond has distinct risks only some of which are set forth below one type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by the incremental tax received on either real property or on sales within a specifically defined geographical area such tax generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the underlying property or revenues another type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by a special tax levied on real property within a defined geographical area in such a manner that the tax is levied on those who benefit from the project such bonds typically provide for a statutory lien on the underlying property for unpaid taxes a third type of dedicatedtax supported bond may be secured by a tax levied upon the manufacture sale or consumption of commodities or upon the license to pursue certain occupations or upon corporate privileges within a taxing jurisdiction as to any of these types of bonds the ability of the designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such bonds may be affected by changes in the local economy the financial success of the enterprise responsible for the payment of the taxes the value of any property on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in a timely fashion each of these factors will have a different affect on each distinct type of dedicatedtax supported bonds municipal lease revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity such payments are normally subject to annual budget appropriations of the leasing governmental entity a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby special obligation to crossover some of the bonds in a trust may be issued with the intention of crossover refunding an outstanding issue at a future date these bonds are secured to the crossover date by us government securities purchased with the proceeds of the refunding bonds the revenues of such an issuer could be adversely affected by problems associated with the outstanding issue economic social and environmental policies and conditions that are not within the control of the issuer and governmental policies and regulations affecting the issuer civic organization obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the pledge of civic organizations including their assets the problems faced by such issuers include the ability to collect pledges made the unpredictable nature of an organizations composition and participation the quality and skill of management increased costs and delays attributable to organizations expenses and legislation regarding certain organizational purposes original issue discount bonds and stripped obligations certain of the bonds in a trust may be original issue discount bonds these bonds were issued with nominal interest rates less than the rates then offered by comparable securities and as a consequence were originally sold at a discount from their face or par values this original issue discount the difference between the initial purchase price and face value is deemed under current law to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxexempt interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption  gain if any realized in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain see what is the tax status of unitholders the current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its face amount at maturity in a stable interest rate environment the market value of an original issue discount bond would tend to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bond approached maturity certain of the original issue discount bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment of the face amount of the bond at its maturity the effect of owning a zero coupon bond is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of the obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield but at the same time also eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality that pay interest currently original issue discount bonds including zero coupon bonds may be subject to redemption at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption the accreted value plus if applicable some premium pursuant to such call provisions an original issue discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than its face value see the schedules of investments for more information about the call provisions of portfolio bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be stripped obligations which represent evidences of ownership with respect to either the principal amount of or a payment of interest on a taxexempt obligation an obligation is stripped by depositing it with a custodian which then effects a separation in ownership between the bond and any interest payment which has not yet become payable and issues evidences of ownership with respect to such constituent parts a stripped obligation therefore has economic characteristics similar to zero coupon bonds as described above each stripped obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount payable at maturity with respect to each unitholder the internal revenue code treats as original issue discount that portion of the discount which produces a yield to maturity as of the date of purchase of the unitholders units equal to the lower of the coupon rate of interest on the underlying obligation or the yield to maturity on the basis of the purchase price of the unitholders units which is allocable to each stripped obligation original issue discount which accrues with respect to a stripped obligation will be exempt from federal income taxation to the same extent as interest on the underlying obligations see what is the tax status of unitholders in part b of this prospectus unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the state and local tax consequences of owning original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations under applicable provisions governing determination of state and local taxes interest on original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there is no corresponding cash payment why and how are the bonds insured insurance on the bonds insured truststhe bonds in the trust are covered by

traditional trust are summarized below this information is derived principally from official statements and preliminary official statements relating to issues of maryland obligations and does not purport to be a complete description from  to  the state of maryland was negatively impacted by a downturn in the nations economy and decreased defense spending and subcontracting work since then however job creation has increased and the unemployment rate has decreased in  marylands unemployment rate was  compared to the national rate of  job creation has been strongest in the areas of business services construction finance insurance and real estate while the weakest have been banks utilities and several manufacturing industries  jobs were added to marylands employment base in  per capita personal income in maryland averaged  in  while in  the population reached nearly  million state and local government marylands fiscal year ends june  as of that date for  overall revenues for the state totaled  billion this figure represents an increase of  over revenues for fiscal year  income taxes sales taxes and transportation revenue constitute most of the states revenue during fiscal  the individual income tax the largest source of revenue produced an additional  in receipts over the previous year due to continued gains in employment personal income and capital gains corporate income tax revenues increased by  during the same time period the states total expenditures reached  billion in fiscal year  this figure represents a  billion or  increase over spending in the same period for  revenues exceeded expenditures by  million and the actual fund balance for the states general fund on june   was  billion an increase of  million over the previous year the public indebtedness of the state of maryland and its instrumentalities is divided into three general types the state itself issues general obligation bonds for capital improvements and for various state and local projects for which property taxes the debt service fund loan repayments and general fund appropriations are used for repayment in addition for transportation purposes the maryland department of transportation issues limited special obligation bonds payable primarily from specific fixedrate excise taxes and other revenues related mainly to highway use certain authorities issue obligations payable solely from specific nontax enterprise fund revenues and for which the state has no liability and has given no moral obligation assurance during fiscal year  maryland issued  million of new general obligation bonds the state currently has  billion in authorized but unissued general obligation bonds the department of transportation and the maryland transportation authority had  million and  million respectively in outstanding limited obligation bonds at the close of the same time period regional economic difficulties reductions in revenues and increased expenses could lead to further fiscal problems for the state and its political subdivisions authorities and agencies difficulty in payment of debt service on borrowings could result in declines in the value of their outstanding obligations and increases in their future borrowing costs the general obligation bonds of the state of maryland are rated by moodys as aaa by standard  poors as aaa and by fitch as aaa while the ratings and other factors mentioned above indicate that maryland and its principal subdivisions and agencies are addressing the effects of the economic recession and overall are in satisfactory economic health there can of course be no assurance that this will continue or that particular bond issues may not be adversely affected by changes in state or local economic or political conditions maryland taxable estimated current return table the following tables show the approximate taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are equivalent to taxexempt estimated current returns under combined federal state and local taxes using published  marginal federal tax rates and marginal state and local tax rates currently available and scheduled to be in effect the

to the highest income within that federal bracket is used the combined state local and federal tax brackets shown reflect the fact that state tax payments are currently deductible for federal tax
