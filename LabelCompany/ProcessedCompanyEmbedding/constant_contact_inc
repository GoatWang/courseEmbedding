object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

financial gain it seems constant contact will tell customers whatever they want to hear to make them happy or retain them as a customer i think its time big business be held accountable for misleading smaller businesses more » buyer beware  last year i was repeatedly told by constant contact customer service more than  rep too that they bill customers based upon the  of emailed contacts per month not the  of active contacts per month and constant contacts billing cycles are so backwards that its hard to decipher when you are billed for what nonetheless i just spent  minutes on the phone with them jeff in customer service and jillian in billing are the last people i spoke to explaining the problem constant contact is overcharging me for nonemailed contacts despite their staff telling me this could never happen please contact me s belisle at ce institute if the same has happened to you i imagine i am not the only customer who was provided this misleading information for constant contacts financial gain it seems constant contact will tell customers whatever they want to hear to make them happy or retain them as a customer i think its time big business be held accountable for misleading smaller businesses business response thank you for sharing your experience as we welcome and invite feedback so we can continue to improve the customer experience in reviewing your case and the documentation provided to you it appears there might be some confusion on how the pricing works we charge monthly based off of the highest number of contacts from the previous billing cycle so an account that fluctuates the number of contacts greatly could be affected by this our support team is always at the ready to help adjust your billing and settings accordingly to make sure every email marketing campaign is a success wed be more than happy to clarify any confusion or answer any question you have please feel free to reach out to our team at socialsupportatconstantcontactdotcom if you
