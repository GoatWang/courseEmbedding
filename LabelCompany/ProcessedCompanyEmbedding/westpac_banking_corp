dynamic lvr on inner city apartments is at  the lvr ratio on inner city apartments is of particular relevance in light of significant concerns over a housing bubble in this market it can thus be said that the bank’s asset quality and capital levels are reasonable though not the best of the australian banks earnings and dividend westpac banking corp is expected to yield  in  as analysts widely expect a dividend cut it is nevertheless the second highest forward dividend yield of the majors it may be worth noting that wbk’s dividend is ordinarily fully franked which means that there will be no dividend withholding tax for us investors source reuters the expected dividend cut would also be an event which is considered rather rare for australian banks as can be seen in the chart below wherefore many shareholders doubt the dividend will be cut this risk should not however be understated as the banks expected payout ratio at  is also the second highest of the majors source simplywallst the increased efforts to introduce banking levels will also have a negative impact on the banks earnings and increases the likelihood of a dividend cut if successful the national government introduced a banking levy on the five biggest australian banks in may which it expected to raise a billion in years these figures have since been disputed as the levy will have a negative impact on net profit and thus lead to a corresponding decrease in the corporate taxes paid by the bank the levy is nevertheless likely to cost wbk more than a million per annum lower than expected revenue for the state from the levy also increases the probability of it being increased to cover the shortfall despite the governments promises that it will not be increased the new banking levy by the state government of south australia intends on introducing the same levy as the national levy adjusted for its share about  of the total value of bank liabilities subject to the federal government levy the impact of this levy on wbk will likely be substantially lower than that of the national levy but would nevertheless likely exceed a million per annum the state treasurer of western australia has also since stated that his state would be looking into implementing a similar levy if successful in south australia in short it can thus be said that government officials seem to believe they have discovered a bottomless pit of money into which they can easily tap these levies are therefore likely to have a negative impact on customers and shareholders alike at a time when australian banks are already facing historically low return on equity roe levels wbk reported a  roe on a cash basis which is a  basispoint yoy increase from the first half of  this is also slightly above the  average roe for the majors as a group the bank also reported a basis point increase in its net interest margin nim and was the only one of the majors to see a rise in its nim valuation and conclusion wbk is trading at  times expected earnings for  which is the second highest of the majors this is also broadly in line with its year average forward pe ratio in the region of  source reuters when comparing the banks price to book value to its roe relative to that of its peers it also becomes apparent that the stocks valuation levels seem to be broadly in line with that of its peers source reuters it can therefore be concluded that wbk’s underlying fundamentals remain strong the potential of a dividend cut and increased taxes on australian banks does however heighten the risk of investing in the bank
