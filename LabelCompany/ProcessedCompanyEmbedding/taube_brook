aum at medley ended the quarter at  billion that was up over  million or  yearoveryear the fee earning aum at quarter end was over  billion during the quarter we issued  million in sevenyear unsecured notes the net proceeds from this bond offering combined with the previous issuance of bonds which is in the latter part of  these were used to fully repay the outstanding balance on our term loan and provide additional cash to support growth of the business these public debt offerings allowed us to extend our maturities term out and fix the rate on the debt all with new unsecured borrowings at this point the balance sheet at medley is in very strong position to support our growth in the years ahead overall at the firm we remain focused on building the business around the combination of permanent capital long dated private funds and separately managed accounts across all five of our investment disciplines we continue to see significant demand for the various yield solutions coming from both institutional and retail on the institutional side of the business over the past  months we received approximately  million of commitments from institutional investors and on the retail side sierra remains a leader in the retail channel and we continue to expand the product offerings sierra income corporation continues to raise capital and remains top performer among its peer group and i’m pleased to report that we have begun executing selling agreements with broker dealers and we anticipate selling shares in sierra total return fund in the near future and finally we’re on file with our third branded  sierrabranded product sierra opportunity fund and we expect to launch this fund in the latter half of this year or early  these product expansions are important steps as we continue to diversify our alternative asset management platform i am pleased to announce the addition of chris allen who came to the medley platform recently at medley he will be responsible for managing our structured credit strategy chris brings deep experience in structured credit and will add value to medley’s investment capabilities as we continue to scale and strength the products at medley for our investors i’d like to turn the call over now for a moment to rick to give you a quick update on the financials rick allorto thank you brook our results from operations for the three months ended march st were as follows total revenues were  million compared to  million for the same period in  revenue consisted of  million of management fees  million of other revenues and fees and a reversal of  million our performance fees the decrease in revenue was due primarily to  million decrease in part  incentive fees from our permanent capital vehicles and the reversal of performance fees total expenses were  million compared to  million for the first quarter of  this decrease was due primarily to  million decrease in esa expenses pretax core net income was  million compared to  million for the same period in  other income net was  million compared to other expense net of  million in the first quarter of  the variance was due primarily to a decrease in expense associated with our revenue share payable partially offset by an increase in interest expense core net income per share was  during the three months ended march   versus  for the three months ended march   core ebitda decreased by  million to  million compared to  million for the same period in  that concludes my financial review ill now turn the call back over to brook brook taube thanks rick as i said we continue to add high quality investment talent to the platform adding assets under management and our product expansion continues to diversify medleys platform all of this is going to continue to support our growth in the years ahead thank you for your continued support we can now open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler with credit suisse your line is now open craig siegenthaler so first just on the investing environment while youre not raising capital at the core bdc you are in your other strategies and refi activity is fairly high so i just wanted to see if you could let us know how easier challenging it is say to put that capital to work in good risk adjusted credits brook taube yearoveryear volumes have been a little bit higher but were coming off of an early  that was noticeably lower in volume and that related to the challenged market in that part of  as we look in this year activity is picking up but were seeing spreads compressing both in the public and in the private markets so there are some challenges at the same time we are seeing deal flow of our pipeline is strong and these are with sensible returns as well as sensible structure so were being careful but we are seeing volume does that answer the question craig siegenthaler and then just as a follow up on the lower part  incentive fees do you guys have any visibility on those fees into the second quarter just because were kind of already in the second quarter right now rick allorto craig this is rick we’d expect to return to our historical part  incentive and performance fees as we continue to grow the platform and add assets under management operator and our next question comes from the line of casey alexander with compass point research your line is now open casey alexander first of all to followup on that last question when you say you expect to return get historical part one incentive fees i guess question related to q was that q or at some point in time in the future rick allorto casey this is rick to clarify it’s really more into the future the latter part of ’ early ’ casey alexander secondly can you  now that you’ve finished the debt offerings what on a quarterly basis do you expect the run rate of interest expenses to be rick allorto casey on a run rate basis interest expense is going to be approximately  million for the quarter casey alexander and lastly just to followup on a question i asked last quarter i asked about the lack of reimbursable offering expenses and it was suggested that for forward modeling purposes we should look back at the historical rates of offering expenses and yet in this quarter there was again no reimbursement for fund offering expenses and as i said this is  at the time this is something that is highly challenging for us to model is there any better clarity that you can give us on the reimbursable offering expenses going forward because it obviously has a tangible impact on adjusted ebitda rick allorto and casey you’re specifically referring to sierra income corporation casey alexander no i’m referring to medley management rick allorto unfortunately i don’t have any additional guidance to give you at this point in time casey casey alexander okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of ann dai with kbw your line is now open ann dai first question i just wanted to touch on the lower comp i’m just curious if you think this is a descent run rate for the year and also wondering what areas of the firm the severance expense was driven by whether it’s just one departure or if there were if its more than that brook taube regarding the comp and the run rate the current quarter is a good run rate and then regarding the severance that was due to a onetime  departure of the single person ann dai and could you also give us some color on what specific products grow the growth in aum this quarter was it the clo platform or something else brook taube the growth in aum came from the expansion of the credit facilities in the joint ventures at the bdcs and then the growth in fee earning aum came predominately from the deployment of capital within the managed accounts operator operator instructions and im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to mr brook taube for closing remarks brook taube thank you can we just check i think ann had indicated she wanted to get back in the queue and maybe she was requeuing operator and we do have a follow from ann dai with kbw your line is now open ann dai i just have one more for you guys i guess if im just thinking about the current earnings power and the pace of capital deployment and the fact that theyre still building out a bunch of new product offerings does it make sense at this point to maybe revisit the dividend and give yourselves a bit more breathing room to invest into the business or are you very committed to that dividend brook taube looking at the business today we obviously have plenty of the cash on the balance sheet to support growth id say our current earnings level really includes limited part  incentive and performance fees so as rick alluded to our expectation is that we will earn these incentive and performance fees overtime on a runrate basis at the back half of  and for sure in  if everything were stable so if we look at that as well as our dry powder that’s assets we have that will be deployed in the quarters and years also with new products that are in queue launched and pending launch we remain optimistic about the earnings power both in the medium and longterm so at this point the board approved the dividend well obviously keep folks posted but we’re optimistic about the medium and longterm growth of the platform for sure operator im now showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to mr brook taube for closing remarks brook taube thank you very much again were pleased probably the best time here as the addition and continued addition of high quality talents the products are expanding selling agreements are being signed for sierra total return fund and other products are in queue the team is doing a great job were looking forward to growing product and people and look

financial review and then we’ll take the questions we continue to build the business around our combinations of our permanent capital and long dated funds and separately managed accounts as we’ve said before these sources of capital will continue to provide steady cash return to shareholders of mdly over time in this second quarter our fee earning assets under management continued to rise and with the end of the quarter permanent capital representing  of our total fee earning assets with the remaining  in the institutional side which is the funds and managed accounts as a firm we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued opportunity that exists in direct lending in the middle market in the us our team has continued to grow and we are excited about the opportunity that we are seeing in the market today and we are going to continue to seek ways and gain shareholder value at mdly in the quarters in the years ahead on a yearoveryear basis permanent capital fee earning assets under management grew by  while our institution capital fee earning assets increased by  during the second quarter permanent capital and institutional capital fee earning assets each grew sequentially  compared to the prior quarter the quarter over quarter growth on the permanent capital fee earnings side was primarily driven by our ongoing capital raise for sierra we’re pleased to see continued growth for sierra and look forward to further grow during the balance of this year in this segment of our business at medley capital corporation our publicly traded bdc there were three important developments since our last earnings call one we’ve increased the capital at our sbic  million and we expect this will be fully deployed by the end of this current quarter two at mcc we amended and extended our ing credit facility the maturity was extended we amended the facility to buy more flexibility to the company and we lowered the pricing and finally third on august th we added  million credit facility with credit suisse to support the activities of our senior loan joint venture at mcc these three developments at mcc demonstrates the very strong support we have institutional lending partners turning now to share repurchase as i mentioned in the initial remarks we received approval from the board to implement a  million share repurchase program and this program is approved for a one year period the purpose of the share repurchase program is twofold first to the extent that we grant rsus we’ll use the repurchase program to offset this issuance by purchasing an amount that will generally offset the number of rsus we’ll grant the magnitude of the rsu grant in the near future however is not expected to be significant and second from time to time based upon market price we may selectively acquire shares of mdly in the open market i’d like now to turn the call over to seth seth taube thanks brook as you see brook mentioned we continue to see growth sierra the order that we continue to add selling agreements we now have  selling agreements up  that’s an addition of  important new brokerdealer relationships during the quarter share now reaches over  independent financial representatives to those  selling agreements the increasing secular demand for alternative field products we sell is significant remains significant certain estimates have reached that exposure to alternative rising to as much as  trillion  this will be an increase of as much as  trillion and we’ll continue to focus on broadening and deepening our broker dealer and advisor relationships in the quarters ahead to meet this increasing demand last quarter sierra and mcc each announced the formation of separate senior loan joint ventures with great american life insurance as we announced on august th both medley capital corporation and sierra income corporation each completed raising  million credit facility to support these joint ventures as investments are allocated for joint ventures we expect these financial facilities will ramp in line with origination we have a pipeline of high quality opportunities and we expect to begin originate assets into the joint venture to begin ramp the financing of these joint ventures in the second half of  these joint ventures broaden up the product offerings and represented national extension of our lending franchise during the quarter our platform  across the whole platform we deployed  million of total capital to  borrowers in seven industries the average yield on these investments is  this new origination was  floating rate and  first lean we continue to remain selective and careful on our underwriting we continue to see attractive opportunities available in the market with various  vehicle and now i’d like to turn the call over to rick allorto our chief financial officer to review the second quarter financial results rick rick allorto thank you seth our standalone results from operations for the three months ended june   were as follows management fees increased by  or  million to  million compared to the same period in  this was primarily due to an increase in fee earning aum performance fees for the quarter were negative  million primarily due to valuation adjustment as a result of valuation adjustments this period total revenues decreased by  to  million to  million compared to  million for the same period in  total expenses decreased by ph or  million to  million compared to  million for the same period in  the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in our performance fee compensation payable total other expense increase by  million to  million compared to  million for the same period in  the increase was due primarily to a  million increase in interest expense partially offset by a decrease in other expenses pretax core net income increased by  million to  million compared to the same period in  core net income per share was  per share for the three month ended june  as compared to  per share for the same period in  core ebitda increased by  million to  million as compared to  million for the same period in  that concludes my financial review i will now turn the call back over to brook brook taube thanks rick and thank you all again for joining us today we had  sequential growth in fee earning assets under management this quarter and  growth on a yearoveryear basis we extended and amended our credit facilities at mcc providing increased flexibility and strengthening mcc balance sheet and in addition at mcc and sierra we secured important lending capacity to grow those senior loan joint ventures at sierra we continue to expand our relationship with brokerdealers and financial advisors and at medley we had several high quality professionals in the team in the past quarter and we’ll continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value at mdly appreciate your continued support and operator we can now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler with credit suisse please go ahead craig siegenthaler thanks guys it’s craig siegenthaler with credit suisse here if we take a step back and look at core earnings they are below the levels of last year so i’m wondering i think we all see how aum growth and lower yields have impacted the profit levels too but may be you can provide us a update on the level of kind of core eps growth going forward here brook taube craig it’s brook if the question is about the targeted growth in the core number on the balance of the year craig siegenthaler it’s actually two parts one is can you help us on your perspective in terms of your ability to grow earnings here at this point going forward and then the second part of my question would be may be you could remind us on the special dividend top up math just giving the buyback here so i’m just trying to forecast where the dividend could be heading brook taube sure let’s start with the first one if we take out the performance of – volatility that hit in each of the last quarter it was down in q up in q down here this represents a mark to market of something approximately like  up and down on our private fund due to the fact that our private fund are institutional business is passage rate and in it what we call it catch up phase the percentage change in the asset value material or otherwise is captured one for one in terms of our performance fees we expect and hope that that volatility will not continue although it might we normalize and hope that constant we would still expect to be able to grow core earnings over the balance of next year and into next year craig siegenthaler and then my second part there was could you remind us of how the dividend topoff fourth quarter and last quarter because i believe if you are able to grow earnings you’re – threshold it would be prospect for a topup dividend and may be this fourth quarter or fourth quarter ‘ so does that amount work brook taube sure we have not stated that we will pay special dividend by any specified equation i think we have – as you can see have the ability and continue to grow fee earnings assets under management that will translate into earnings growth and our intention is to increase the dividend over time at this point we have not specified a specific topup dividend to the extent that earnings rise which is our expectation through time we will be looking to increase the dividend and effective pay off per share craig siegenthaler okay thank you guys thanks brook brook taube thanks craig operator thank you your next question comes from the line of ann dai of kbw please go ahead ann dai hi good morning thanks for taking my questions on the roughly  million in commitment to the long dated funds and smas does that reflect in additional closings for – or was that capital drawn down for the managed account rick allorto hi ann this is rick the majority of that additional capital deployed was in the managed account ann dai okay great thank you and also just quickly on the repurchase program you guys mentioned that you’ll be purchasing membership units on a one for one basis alongside the class a shares i was just wondering what the reason for that was rick allorto ann that was set up initially preipo within the organizational documents ann dai great and just given how the stock has traded over the past couple of months you mentioned mof ii repurchase program to opportunistically buyback stock so do you view the current stock prices attractive and a buying opportunity here brook taube we do think it’s attractive and as i mentioned in the call we are going to do it selectively as we look into share price over the next year ann dai okay great thanks operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of alex – of goldman sachs please go ahead unidentified analyst great hey good morning everybody brook taube hi alex unidentified analyst so just to follow up on the capital management discussion i guess you were about  million of net debt from the balance sheet you are paying out something like  of your earnings and dividend just help me bridge the map on – if the dividend stays at  and kind of how can you operate in this environment  the cash flow flexibility can be managed by that stock rick allorto alex we do have – and you’re referencing net debt number we obviously do have in excess of  million cash on balance sheet that is available to us as well as  million undrawn revolver the liabilities are relatively longdated from today’s date and it’s a bullet maturity we’re amortized through  unidentified analyst okay and what is the kind of like the minimum amount of working capital or cash do you guys feel like you need more cash on balance sheet so  million cash number how low could it go brook taube alex this is brook we raised the capital we have the intention to continue to evaluate new product expansion i think the idea would be that the use of cash would be to drive ebitda and additional earnings we haven’t specified the minimum amount but i think you can put a pin in  million of cash on balance sheet as a minimum as we look out at this point we don’t have a specific use for the  million today between here and there but we are continuing to evaluate again both new product and other strategic alternatives each of which we expect would drive revenue and ebitda unidentified analyst got it that makes sense shifting gears a little bit so i think you guys mentioned lower fees at mcc just wanted to make sure i understand that correctly how is that if at all impacting i guess the management company is lower kind of fee already in the run rate or should we expect to see any kind of fee rate compression on the publicly traded – brook taube i’m not sure i exactly understand the question you’re talking about the nominal revenues from mcc at the moment unidentified analyst no just saying i think and if i misunderstood at the time i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks you lowered the fees in mcc brook taube that is not correct sorry i think i understand now the fees are not lower at mcc we have not made that comment unidentified analyst okay couple of other ones if we kind of take a step back just hoping to better understand the impact of higher interest rates on the business as a whole specifically under the scenario if were to go up  basis points to  basis points then it’s not fair just trying to understand how that dynamic would impact the management and i guess the overall profitability of business brook taube sure that’s a good question let me start at the high level as seth mentioned  of our investment for floating rate this quarter across the platform it’s not quite  but it’s in the mid s in terms of floating rate exposure what that means for us at our vehicles are that the assets yield will generally rise with libor in the short term there are some floors which are in place so the specific per basis point rise in the rate may not have a immediate impact but in a secular rising rate environment assuming that it takes the curve back over time you will see the nominal yields on our investments rise our view is that that is likely to occur when gdp is positive and that is compatible with the growth in the economy so to the extent that that’s happening in a positive gdp stable economic environment we would have rising asset yields and we would not be looking at a terribly difficult credit environment that will boil down to us from the margin is the higher revenues and better credit performance on the portfolio we have termed out our liabilities and we continue to do so on our vehicles the bdcs so we should have a very positive impact over time to rising rate if it occurs in that positive gdp scenario unidentified analyst okay gotcha thanks operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of mickey schleien of landenburg please go ahead mickey schleien yes good morning i wanted to ask if you could give us some background on what caused the weak performance at mof ii spreads look like they were generally stable so i would suppose it was probably company specific and i’m just curious if it was coinvestments and things like them indiscernible or was it something else like oil and gas brook taube good question mick it was really related to one position that you mentioned it mof i think you know that credit from the mcc portfolio that is also in mof ii on the balance of the portfolio there was no material changes on the institutional side mickey schleien okay and any background you can give us on how mof ii is doing this quarter trying to get an handle on the performance feed line which has been very volatile as you mentioned brook taube sure at this point we have not we’re kind of half way through the quarter it’s difficult to tell specifically but our sense is that it would be relatively stable as we look today and that is to say we would have a  normal quarter leak run rate on the institutional side but again it’s mid quarter mickey schleien yeah okay couple other question brook a question i’ve asked on medley on capital call capital debt equities  but the regulatory level is only  and it’s actually down since you’ve drawn the  of that so i’m just curious in terms of how you’re weighing potentially increasing the bond balance sheet leverage or you’re more focused on funding the off balance sheet to your loan fund brook taube we will focus on funding the off balance sheet senior loan fund as we said mickey we keep repeating at this point we do not intend to increase the on balance sheet leverage the key criteria that we’re focused on that mcc as well as the platform and that’s evidenced by the origination seth referred to  is first lean secured with covenant it’s not a call on the cycle but at this point it makes sense to stay secured with covenant so i would not expect any increase in leverage at mcc mickey schleien okay fair enough and my last question brook it relates to management i saw the hiring of david indelicato and i’m just curious whether his role will be the same – it was a ge or is he going to be shifting gears to help broaden the platform anything you can tell us about that would be helpful seth taube hi mickey this is seth here we are really excited to have david join the team to bolster this already existing strong credit management or the management system we have he’s really seasoned investment professional long track record across underwriting structure and restructuring so we are pleased to have him join the team i would say you can assume that he is deploying the skills that he’s developed very successful in the past he did a similar – mickey schleien and is he focused on a particular industry or a new industry for medley seth taube he joined the credit management so he is specific to his accountabilities range from the underwriting asset management and restructuring so not origination but specifically investment cycle really the credit management side which has those three specific accountabilities that are reported to him mickey schleien okay i understand thank you for taking my questions and for your time this morning seth taube thanks mick operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of casey alexander with gilford securities please proceed casey alexander yeah hi good morning most of my questions have been answered but i noticed that rcs capital was in the process of selling their wholesale distribution system did that include sc distributors your distribution arm and does that free up any new or regenerate any old brokerdealer agreements for you seth taube okay casey this is seth they did announce this week that a follow out strategic – rcs and that does include our wholesaler strategic capital take a general view is that all those commitment in nontraded space is terrific development for that sector and we’re still optimistic on the broker dealers that hadn’t resigned sierra or – maintain the suspension of sierra i think apollo false commitment very significant positive for accelerating resumption of that agreement casey alexander all right great thank you that’s good to hear thanks for taking my questions operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler from credit suisse please go ahead craig siegenthaler thanks guys for the follow up here so while we’re on the subject of distribution for sierra how has sierra’s commitments trended order to date in q relative to the  million that was in q seth taube yeah we were – this is seth we did just under  million capital raising in the second quarter and that was consistent with q so steady fund raising for sierra and i think you can assume that it’s little bit too early to tell what the full quarter will look like in the summer but we’ve seen steady consistent growth at sierra craig siegenthaler got it and then i have a housekeeping question may be for sam what was the permanent capital base rate – permanent capital level one and the longdated private fund management in q and i can say that again if you missed that sam sam anderson yeah i mean craig i don’t believe we specifically disclose fund to level but i’m happy to give you generalization there i mean generally we’re making – disclose the four to the  assets over  or  depending on the funds which is consistent with what we have historically done craig siegenthaler got it could you just disclose those three lines that you have pulled this quarter right sam anderson correct craig siegenthaler okay we can talk offline brook taube thanks craig operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of christopher nolan from mlv  company please go ahead christopher nolan hi thanks for taking my questions is the  million credit facility for the sls for both sierra and mcc based on your questions brook taube yeah they are separate we have  million for mcc and separate commitment from the  million that is also committed to sierra christopher nolan okay so they are two separate agreements both with their own – brook taube yes christopher nolan seth you mentioned what type of strategic opportunities are you currently evaluating you mentioned in your comments you are looking at strategic opportunities brook taube at a high level we continue to focus on expanding broadly our leverage finance capability at one end of the spectrum that would be moving toward more broadly syndicated loans in the limit that’s the clo business and a loan only business the risk retention rules that are pending have created a very interesting dynamic there and i think our insurance partners as well as other players in the market are evaluating the appropriate way to do that i think for the past  to  months we have indicated that that’s something we are looking at and we’ll continue to we have nothing to report specifically there yet secondly and i think it’s consistent with the comment seth made about the secular demand in yield both from institutional and also importantly from retail for evaluating yields alternative yield products some of the volatility obviously in the bdc sector and some of the growth but not at the – in the nontraded sector have caused us to evaluate both the product and the timing but we are still actively looking at new products that we’d feed into this secular for – christopher nolan would this be like the bdc type of product or realestate product or brook taube from an asset class perspective i think we have said that the realestate market opportunity is attractive to us the bdc is in the echo i would not rule out that bdc product in the nontraded share loan we are still picketing and focused on sierra but we intend to expand our product offerings and shelf space in that segment in the years ahead christopher nolan great final question on the repurchases what percentage do you think of that  million program do you think will be directed towards mdly publicly traded shares brook taube yeah just to clarify chris that share repurchase program is  million it’s authorized to mdly to buy mdly shares christopher nolan okay it wasn’t just to offset rcs or anything else brook taube well the two purpose of the share purchase program which will be only for mdly shares would be to buy as i said to buy an amount of mdly that would offset the any grant of rsus approximately that is in a sense to definitely keep the share constant and secondly would be to opportunistically acquire shares of mdly in the open market which would have the effect of reducing the total share count christopher nolan okay thank you for taking my questions brook taube thanks chris operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of alex – with goldman sachs please proceed unidentified analyst thanks just a quick follow up for you guys so there’s been a bunch of investigations i guess launched recently by few – understand that probably early stages but hoping you could help us understand what the risks are of these and then from a pl perspective is there anything on a elevated – sga or anything like that caused by that thanks brook taube are you referring to the announcements of the – from the class action firms unidentified analyst correct brook taube yeah we are aware of the announcements we don’t believe they have basis in any back so there are no numbers at this point running through any of our ga lines unidentified analyst so no like incremental legal expenses or anything else that you would think about things indiscernible quarter – brook taube i mean at this point i would say nothing material unidentified analyst okay thanks brook taube thanks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your questions i would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks brook taube thank you all again for joining us we expect continued growth on the fee earning assets under management our market growing and the opportunity and the products that strategic initiatives again thanks for joining us and have a good rest of the summer we look forward to speaking to you individually as well take care operator ladies
