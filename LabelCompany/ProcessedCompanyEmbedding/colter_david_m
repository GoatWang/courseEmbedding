conservative commentator ann coulter publicly shamed delta on twitter last week after she said she was forced to give up a seat with extra room that she paid for united airlines reached an “amicable” settlement in april with a doctor who went viral after he was forcibly removed from a flight sustaining significant facial injuries it’s a combination of the rising prominence of social media and a nearmonopoly of the airline industry that is contributing to the growing news of airline customers being unduly inconvenienced as they travel attorney arthur alan wolk who specializes in aviation law told fox news these incidents are “happening more because airlines feel that they’re empowered to abuse their passengers more and feel that there are no consequences” wolk said “the reality is if you need to go from philadelphia to san diego and there’s only one airline that flies you there the fact that they may have mistreated a passenger including yourself is not going to prevent you from taking that flight” he added “once you have a monopoly you have no incentive to give good customer service treat people fairly and perform in a manner that you would be expected to perform if there was competition” united airlines controversies wolk says that chances of the airline industry improving for customers is bleak even “nill” “the only way to really improve it…is to have competition”

anyway until she was told to move by a stewardess who was not able to give an explanation for the seat change “the other passenger was not an elderly person was not a sickly person a very tall person” coulter said wolk said coulter’s situation is indicative of another problem with airlines – the seat pitch airline didn’t allow blind man granddaughter on plane as airlines have decreased the seat pitch – the “area between the back of the seat in front of you and where your back rests in your seat” wolk explained –  there has been an increase in safety concerns in an emergency situation should

of  tickmenot kansas city gender female  stars out of  the amazing life of jessi colter and waylon jennings june   tickmenot kansas city gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for an outlaw and a lady a memoir of music life with waylon and the faith that brought me home waylon jennings even if you think you dont know his music if you ever watched the television show the dukes of hazzard you heard him sing the theme song and play the part of the narrator in this book his wife jessi colter also known as miriam eddy tells what life was like living with him she also shares her life story as well waylon was a trial to live with and he didnt try to hide the one night stands he sometimes indulged inespecially when he was on the road he was a drug user especially pep pills and cocaine although jessi loved him deeply and he loved her that wasnt enough to give her the strength to be married to him in fact she did separate from him once and spent much time in prayer about whether or not to stay in the relationship jessi knew that if she went back to him she would be going back to stay with him for life ultimately she did make the decision to reunite with waylon she returned to a life that had some amazing experiences but also some really rough times jessi credits two things for getting through it number one was having faith in god along with his help the other thing was expressing her feelings through music that she was creating jessi is a singer and composer in her own right she might be best known for the song im not lisa which was a huge hit in the s but she is a prolific writer of many other songs and has recorded a number of albums she was part of albums that included waylon and many of their famous friends many wellknown people have also sung her songs over the years they often rubbed shoulders along with calling them friends with such people as johnny cash willie nelson and kris kristoffersonjust to name a few the journey jessi was on after she made the decision to stay married to waylon would include his attempts to give up using drugs and his great desire to have a child with her waylon had some very big musical successes during this time and she often toured with him around the world however jessis one desire was that waylon would accept jesus christ as his savior and become a born again christian this book tells the story of whether or not jessi got her hearts desire along with a whole lot more about their life togetherbecause when she returned to waylon she stayed married to him i was intrigued by the story of jessi and waylons relationship and believe anyone else would be as well i really appreciated the christian aspect that jessi included in this book and the importance she placed on waylons salvation anyone who likes biographies stories about popular entertainers or literature written from a christian viewpoint will enjoy this star book thomas nelson publishers has
