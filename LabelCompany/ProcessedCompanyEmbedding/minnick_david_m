three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency

responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great

appeals see wis stat §  and rule  cir ct no cf apcr state of wisconsin in court of appeals district ii state of wisconsin plaintiffrespondent v david m minnick defendantappellant appeal from a judgment and an order of the circuit court for kenosha county anthony g milisauskas judge affirmed before neubauer pj reilly and gundrum jj ¶ per curiam david m minnick received a sentence quadruple that which he claims defense counsel guaranteed he would get he seeks to withdraw his no contest pleas because he contends they were induced by counsel’s ineffective assistance in making the alleged promises he also asserts that the trial no apcr court’s credibility findings were clearly erroneous and that it erred by refusing to admit documentary evidence relevant to making accurate findings we reject his contentions and affirm ¶ upset that his wife planned to leave him an intoxicated minnick struck her on the head with a rifle butt and attempted to shoot her she fled to her parents’ house down the street minnick followed firing shots in the neighborhood he then tried to break down the door of his inlaws’ house broke windows and shot inside their house grazing his fatherinlaw ¶ minnick was charged with aggravated battery attempted firstdegree intentional homicide four counts of firstdegree reckless endangerment and attempted burglary all by use of a dangerous weapon and with endangering safety by reckless use of a firearm the defense investigated a possible ngi plea due to minnick’s diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder ultimately he withdrew the ngi plea in favor of no contest pleas to all but the attempted firstdegree intentional homicide charge that count was dismissed and read in ¶ even with the dismissal of the attempted homicide charge consecutive sentences could have imprisoned minnick for over a century the court imposed a fortyoneyear sentence twentyseven years’ initial confinement and fourteen years’ extended supervision ¶ postconviction minnick sought plea withdrawal or resentencing he asserted that his no contest pleas were not knowing intelligent and voluntary because they were entered in reliance on defense counsel’s assurances that he would get concurrent sentences totaling no more than ten years the court denied minnick’s motion this appeal followed  no apcr ¶ a defendant’s postsentencing effort to withdraw a guilty or no contest plea must prove a “manifest injustice” by clear and convincing evidence state v negrete  wi  ¶  wis d   nwd  “the manifestinjustice test is satisfied if the defendant’s plea was the result of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel” state v hudson  wi app  ¶  wis d   nwd  review denied  wi   wis d   nwd  to establish constitutional ineffectiveness a defendant must show both deficient representation and resulting prejudice strickland v washington  us    we uphold a trial court’s factual findings unless clearly erroneous but decide de novo the legal question of whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective state v pitsch  wis d    nwd   a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when “it is against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence” state v arias  wi  ¶  wis d   nwd  citation omitted ¶ minnick and defense counsel laura walker testified at the postconviction hearing minnick testified that walker assured him that if he pled no contest he “would get five to seven years absolutely no more than ten” and that the sentencing judge “never never issued a consecutive sentence” he acknowledged however that walker “would say of course … i can’t say exactly” what the sentence would be and that he understood the sentence ultimately was up to the court ¶ walker conceded that she told minnick she believed he would be “looking at anywhere between six to ten years” and “probably would get a concurrent sentence” but denied telling him that the judge never ordered consecutive sentences she also testified that she told minnick “repeatedly” that  no apcr the disposition she believed likely was her opinion and that it “always had the caveat on the end that it’s ultimately up to the judge what’s going to happen” ¶ the trial court found minnick’s testimony not credible and walker’s credible deciding which witnesses are to be believed “is the exact function of the trier of fact” state v christopher  wis d    nwd   minnick contends that finding is clearly erroneous however because the court based it on a misinterpretation of his testimony and failed to consider the corroborating testimony of his friend brother and daughter who all had spoken to walker while minnick was pondering whether to enter no contest pleas ¶ the allegedly misconstrued testimony was elicited when postconviction counsel was questioning minnick about the events leading to the charges against him minnick confirmed that he did not dispute that “something very serious” had occurred that night this exchange followed q you’re not asserting that you weren’t there or that you didn’t pull the trigger or that— a q —you weren’t drinking or any of that correct a ¶ no no minnick contends that as at other points in his testimony in his nervousness he interrupted counsel’s single question with his “no” answer the court found however that minnick “lied under oath” having told the arresting officers that he had drunk about eight twelveounce beers and the fact that “the defendant under oath tells me he wasn’t drinking … goes to his credibility” ¶ assuming without deciding that the court’s finding about minnick’s testimony was clearly erroneous the error was harmless  the court made no apcr numerous other findings in regard to minnick’s claim that he pled in reliance on walker’s alleged promises it found that minnick had weeks to consider the plea offer knew that the attempted firstdegree intentional homicide charge—with the weapons enhancer a sixtyfiveyear felony—would be read in for sentencing and that the presentence investigation report recommended all consecutive sentences totaling twentysix and onehalf years and understood from the plea colloquy that the court could impose the maximum sentence on each count and that all sentences could be imposed consecutively the record confirms these findings ¶ minnick also contends the court failed to consider his supporters’ corroborating testimony his friend testified that walker “was very certain” that minnick “would do five to seven with an absolute possibility of maybe ten” years and that there was “no way” consecutive sentences would be ordered but he acknowledged he understood walker was conveying her professional opinion the brother testified that walker told him minnick’s sentence would be “something in the area of less than ten years but right around six and a half” that she was “really careful in her wording not to make an allout guarantee” and while “it was pretty clear that that’s what she was hinting at” it was “somewhat an interpretation” the daughter testified that walker said she “was strongly believing” “the judge wouldn’t give minnick any more than six years” but that she also “told me it was her opinion” the testimony of minnick and his supporters does not establish that walker gave unequivocal guarantees ¶ minnick has shown no more than that counsel predicted an outcome that did not come to pass her misjudgment of the likely sentence is not a basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim see state v provo  wi app  ¶  wis d   nwd  and minnick’s “disappointment in the  no apcr eventual punishment imposed is no ground for withdrawal of a guilty plea” see state v booth  wis d    nwd  ct app  ¶ in a related argument minnick contends that the trial court erred by refusing to admit at the postconviction hearing documentary evidence relevant and necessary to a proper assessment of walker’s credibility the documents were an office of lawyer regulation public reprimand walker received in regard to her handling of this and other of minnick’s cases and a criminal complaint alleging felony charges against her before she obtained her law license he claims they would have shown walker’s motivation to protect herself and her “willingness to act extremely when in conflict” ¶ the admission of evidence is left to the discretion of the trial court state v jackson  wis d    nwd   we will not find an erroneous exercise of discretion where the trial court applied the facts of record to accepted legal standards id ¶ walker served as power of attorney over minnick’s finances while she represented him and was responsible for paying herself from his accounts minnick’s complaint to olr arose from a fee dispute—minnick claimed he owed walker  in fees she claimed it was —and the state of his accounts at the end of her representation walker was reprimanded for violating supreme court rules relating to fee agreements her management and maintenance of the trust account and its records notice and manner of withdrawals and the failure to provide a full written accounting of the funds held in trust when her representation ended minnick argues that the olr matter should have been admitted as it gave walker a motive to protect herself through her postconviction testimony  no apcr ¶ we disagree consistent with walker’s claim olr noted that her original flat rate increased to  when the scope of her representation expanded beyond the criminal matter walker acknowledged failing to amend the fee agreement or draft a new one and violating other ethical rules and consented to the reprimand and while olr stated that minnick claimed about  was unaccounted for at the end olr did not make a finding that such was the case as the state notes evidence that olr apparently believed walker’s position is not relevant as it would not have a tendency to make her credibility less probable and thus not admissible see wis stat §§    ¶ further the statement about the allegedly misappropriated or at least unaccountedfor sums is double hearsay to be admissible each prong of hearsay within hearsay must conform with an exception to the hearsay rule see wis stat §  state v kreuser  wis d    nwd   neither does ¶ the olr decision also was not admissible as otheracts evidence of walker’s motive to testify falsely assessing the admissibility of such evidence requires the trial court to determine whether the evidence is offered for an acceptable purpose is relevant and its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice confusion or delay state v sullivan  wis d    nwd    all references to the wisconsin statutes are to the  version unless otherwise noted  no apcr ¶ while evidence of other bad acts is admissible to prove motive wis stat §  the olr decision is not relevant to prove that walker misappropriated minnick’s money it simply did not make that finding ¶ minnick also wanted admitted a copy of a fivecount criminal complaint against walker she allegedly broke into the home of a love triangle competitor and choked and threatened to kill the person walker was convicted of one count of misdemeanor battery the other counts were dismissed the incident occurred before walker was licensed to practice law the complaint minnick contends would have shown walker’s “willingness to act extremely when in conflict” even to the point of fabricating testimony ¶ the complaint was properly excluded first a complaint is not evidence and raises no inference of guilt state v oppermann  wis d   n  nwd  ct app  wis ji—criminal  beyond that the fiveyearold battery conviction would have been used to show that walker was capable of perjury now because she acted badly in the past that is classic unduly prejudicial “otheracts” propensity evidence that is irrelevant to a determination of credibility see wis stat § a see also state v clark  wis d    nwd  ct app  ¶ the record supports the trial court’s credibility findings and evidentiary rulings we will not disturb
