monetary system by jacob a frenkel book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide these two volumes present analytical work done in the fund on the international monetary system over the  period most of the articles were written by fund staff but the book also contains a number of countributions by academic consultants to the fund the aim is to provide not a comprehensive collection of work done in the fund the list would be too long for that but rather to bring together a set of papers that conveys the flavor of those live issues about the

monetary and exchange rate issues the ems emu and german unification exchange rate determination alternative exchange arrangements and reform of the system and foreign exchange markets exchange market intervention and international reserves the world economic system  performance and prospects book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide international vat harmonization  economic effects by jacob a frenkel book  editions published in  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper highlights key macroeconomic issues related to vat harmonization a model is developed which emphasizes the effects of changes in the profile of various taxes on international behavior dynamic simulations reveal that the macroeconomic and welfare implications of vat harmonization including conflicts of interest depend critically on the tax system and the degree of subsitution governing temporal and intertemporal allocations we also demonstrate that the effects of revenueneutral tax conversions between income and consumption tax systems undertaken by a single country depend critically on international differences in behavior international effects of tax reforms by jacob a frenkel book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper highlights the significance of openeconomy considerations in the analysis of tax reforms it focuses on domestic and international consequences of revenueneutral conversion between income and valueadded tax systems the principal result is that the direction of changes in key macroeconomic variables consequent on such tax conversions depends critically on the durrent account position for example a conversion from an income to a valueadded tax system lowers the world interest rate if the country adopting the reform runs a surplus in the current account of its balance of payments and vice versa from centrallyplanned to market economies  the road from cpe to pcpe by guillermo a calvo book  editions published in  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper deals with the early stages of transformation of centrally planned economies cpes into market economies during which expectations play a key role it focuses on the transitional phase during which the economy is not any more a cpe but has not yet become a market economy during this phase the economy is referred to as a previously centrallyplanned economy pcpe a simple model is developed to analyze the consequences of expected price liberalization the cpes undergoing transformation lack depth and breadth of financial markets the analysis illustrates the benefits from an early development of such markets it demonstrates the benefits from an early development of such markets it demonstrates the cost of a finetuning strategy and the benefits from a quick implementation of price reform the paper also examines means to reduce liquidity overhang and shows that they involve taxation of one form or another the consequences of privatization are analyzed and the benefits from an early development of an effective tax system highlighted functioning of the international monetary system book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide

the  period most of the articles were written by fund staff but the book also contains a number of countributions by academic consultants to the fund the aim is to provide not a comprehensive

economic effects by jacob a frenkel book  editions published in  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper highlights key macroeconomic issues related to vat harmonization a model is developed which emphasizes the effects of changes in the profile of various taxes on international behavior dynamic simulations reveal that the macroeconomic and welfare implications of vat harmonization including conflicts of interest depend critically on the tax system and the degree of subsitution governing temporal and intertemporal allocations we also demonstrate that the effects of revenueneutral tax conversions between income and consumption tax systems undertaken by a single country depend critically on international differences in behavior international effects of tax reforms by jacob a frenkel book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper highlights the significance of openeconomy considerations in the analysis of tax reforms it focuses on domestic and international consequences of revenueneutral conversion between income and valueadded tax systems the principal result is that the direction of changes in key macroeconomic variables consequent on such tax conversions depends critically on the durrent account position for example a conversion from an income to a valueadded tax system lowers the world interest rate if the country adopting the reform runs a surplus in the current account of its balance of payments and vice versa from centrallyplanned to market economies

transformation of centrally planned economies cpes into market economies during which expectations play a key role it focuses on the transitional phase during which the economy is not any more a cpe but has not yet become a market economy during this phase the economy is referred to as a previously centrallyplanned economy pcpe a simple model is developed to analyze the consequences of expected price liberalization the cpes undergoing transformation lack depth and breadth of financial markets the analysis illustrates the benefits from an early development of such markets it demonstrates the benefits from an early development of such markets it demonstrates the cost of a finetuning strategy and the benefits from a quick implementation of price reform the paper also examines means to reduce liquidity overhang and shows that they involve taxation of one form or another the consequences of privatization are analyzed and the benefits from an early development of an effective tax
