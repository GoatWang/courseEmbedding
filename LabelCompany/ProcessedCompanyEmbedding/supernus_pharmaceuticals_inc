approved products oxtellar xr and trokendi xr have seen a solid prescription growth since launchsupernus is developing two adhd candidates spn and spn with a market potential exceeding  billion dollars per yearwith an annual revenue of over  million the company has a secure runway for current and future phase  clinical trialssupernus pharmaceuticals incnasdaqsupn is a pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system diseasesthe company has two marketed products for epilepsy oxtellar xr extendedrelease oxcarbazepine and trokendi xr extendedrelease topiramate the company is also developing several product candidates to address large market opportunities in psychiatry including spn for the treatment of impulsive aggression in adhd patients and spn for the treatment of adhd supernus recently announced that they have received the final fda approval for trokendi xr for treatment of migraine prophylaxis in adults and adolescents over  years of age migraines are one of the most debilitating forms of headaches the two approved products have seen a solid prescription growth since launch and are continuing their growth in the target markets the combined target market potential for oxtellar xr and trokendi xr is estimated to be approximately  billion the potential peak sales for oxtellar xr and trokendi xr is estimated to be greater than  million the psychiatry pipeline of supernus also has two potential multi billion dollar products which are spn  spn spn for the treatment of impulsive aggression in adhd supernus is developing sp molindone hydrochloride with the potential to be the first product to address patients with implusive aggression ia who have adhd although molindone hydrochloride is previously marketed in the us as moban supernus designed sp at much lower strengths and different dosage than that was used in moban the reason for this is probably that moban has a number of unintended side effects including the problematic ability of this drug to cross the placental barrier and affect newborns hence the lowered strength of sp which the company is developing as a treatment for ia in patients who have adhd and if they are able to show efficacy in adhd then they have plans to develop sp as a treatment of cns disorders where ia is widely prevalent however the worry remains that even under a reduced dosage the drug may have some of the side effects of moban while these are not serious side effects in most cases the fda may want to take a different opinion on that impulsive aggression ia is a subtype of maladaptive aggression ia occurs across multiple disorders including adhd autism bipolar disorder schizophrenia alzheimers ptsd and disorders of traumatic stress  so the target market is broad in a phase b randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multicenter study spn demonstrated proof of concept in ia in adhd patients the study was conducted in  year old patients with ia comorbid with adhd the primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of spn in reducing ia as measured by the retrospectivemodified overt aggression scale rmoas after at least three weeks of treatment the trial demonstrated proof of concept and showed promising results which allowed supn to advance it to phase  trials patients who have completed the phase b study were offered the opportunity to continue into an openlevel phase of six months duration currently supernus is conducting a phase  trial for spn this phase  study consists of two clinical studies using their proprietary extendedrelease formulation run concurrently in three arms in approximately  clinical sites in us topline data from this phase  study is expected early next year the company estimates spn to be a billion dollar product for supernus potential gross revenue from adhd autism and ptsd is estimated to be    million with additional impulsive aggression opportunities like schizophrenia bipolar alzheimers oppositional defiant disorder etc spn nonstimulant adhd product supernus is developing spn viloxazine hydrochloride a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor as an oncedaily oral extendedrelease product to treat the symptoms of adhd in children aged  years spn seems to be an effective nonstimulant with tolerable side effects as seen from the initial clinical trials recently supernus conducted a phase b clinical study of spn the objective of the study was to assess the effect in reducing symptoms of adhd in children aged  years and also to evaluate its safety and tolerability the primary endpoint of this study was to show positive change from base line to end of study in the adhdrsiv total scorethis phase b study was designed as doubleblind placebocontrolled multicenter doseranging study three spn doses met the primary endpoint spn was also found to be well tolerated with little adverse events nysemktae spn which has completed the phase b trial successfully is expected to initiate the phase  trial by h the company expects spn to be a billion dollar product for supernus and estimates spns peak gross revenue to be    billion  this assumes peak at  years post launch the companys financial results from last year is promising with net product sales of  million which was up by  over  operating income was  million which was up by  over  as of december  cash cash equivalents marketable securities and long term marketable securities were  million the company has exceeded the original  net product sales and operating income guidance the full year financial guidance for  estimates net product sales to be in the range of  million   million operating income to be  million to  million and rd expenses to be approximately  million supn is at the cusp of a breakthrough in terms of growth like all cusps this can go either way the company really doesnt have a lot of financial backup to survive any large fluctuation in its situation however if the two pipeline products see success supn will have established itself as a solid cns biopharmaceutical investors will see a lot of profit if these two drugs get regulatory approvals however two concerns remain one as outlined above is the side effects of sp which will be a bother for the company until approval perhaps even beyond the other is not specific to supn but to the entire cns biopharma industry which has historically seen much lower approvals than other sectors those are the two hurdles supn must cross in order to see success disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks
