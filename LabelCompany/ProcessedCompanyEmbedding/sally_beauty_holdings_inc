hereto include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap and are therefore referred to as nongaap financial measures  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net earnings basic and diluted earnings per share  adjusted sga expenses and  operating free cash flow we have provided definitions below for these nongaap financial measures and have provided tables in the schedules hereto to reconcile these nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measuresadjusted ebitda  we define the measure adjusted ebitda as gaap net earnings before depreciation and amortization interest expense income taxes sharebased compensation costs related to the company’s previously disclosed data security incidents management transition plan executive separation expenses and asset impairment chargesadjusted net earnings basic and diluted earnings per share and sga expenses – adjusted net earnings basic and diluted earnings per share operating earnings and sga expenses are gaap net earnings earnings per share diluted earnings per share operating earnings and sga expenses that exclude costs related to the company’s previously disclosed management transition plan executive separation expenses data security incidents asset impairment charges and the loss on extinguishment of debt and overlapping interest expense for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying nongaap reconciliations to the comparable gaap financial measureswe are unable to reconcile forecasted adjusted sga as a percent to sales and adjusted operating income growth to us gaap measures without unreasonable efforts because a forecast of certain charges such as restructuring charges and costs related to data security incidents is not practicalwe believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings basic and diluted earnings per share and sga expenses provide valuable information regarding our earnings and business trends by excluding specific items that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of our businesses providing a useful way for investors to make a comparison of our performance over time and against other companies in our industryoperating free cash flow – we define the measure operating free cash flow as gaap net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe operating free cash flow is an important liquidity measure that provides useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated from operations after taking into account capital expenditureswe have provided these nongaap financial measures as supplemental information to our gaap financial measures and believe these nongaap measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information regarding our operating performance and cash flow our management and board of directors also use these nongaap measures as supplemental measures to evaluate our businesses and the performance of management including the determination of performancebased compensation to make operating and strategic decisions and to allocate financial resources we believe that these nongaap measures also provide meaningful information for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and cash flow these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results furthermore the nongaap measures presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies     supplemental schedules   consolidated statements of earnings           a segment information b nongaap financial measures reconciliations adjusted
