returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility such that an investor’s shares when redeemed or sold may be worth more or less than their original costwindhaven’s riskmanagement process includes an effort to monitor and manage risk but should not be confused with and does not imply low risk or the ability to control riskthere are risks associated with any investment approach and windhaven strategies have their own set of risks to be aware of first there are the risks associated with the longterm core strategic holdings for each strategy the more aggressive the windhaven strategy selected the more likely the strategy will contain larger weights in riskier asset classes such as equities second there are distinct risks associated with windhaven strategies shorterterm tactical allocations which can result in more concentration towards a certain asset class or classes this introduces the risk that windhaven could be on the wrong side of a tactical overweight thus resulting in a drag on overall performance or loss of principaldiversification strategies do not ensure a profit and do not protect against losses in declining marketsinternational investments may involve additional risks which could include differences in financial accounting standards currency fluctuations political instability foreign taxes and regulations and the potential for illiquid markets investing in emerging markets may accentuate these riskswindhaven diversified strategies are available through schwab’s managed account connection® program please read schwabs disclosure
