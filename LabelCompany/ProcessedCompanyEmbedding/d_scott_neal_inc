wealth management services ameritrade financial services fidelity charles schwab tiaa cref financial services contact an advisor economicsbased longrange planning a more valid approach to retirement planning by scott neal cpa cfp there are many approaches to financial planning today the most popular are typically divided into two  conventional goal seeking and  the economics’ approach it is important for you to know the difference and to understand which one your financial advisor is using and why he or she may choose one over the other at d scott neal inc we view these two approaches as different tools in our planner’s tool bag just as in carpentry and mechanics one must use the right tool for a particular job in order to achieve optimal results conventional financial planning focuses on how much you need to set aside for a specific future goal ie buying an asset such as a car a boat putting a down payment on a house or funding a child’s college education each targeted objective has a specific usually very shortlived time frame for getting it done note the nature of the transaction you save money for some period of time to spend it rather quickly of course college funding requires expenditures over  or  years but that is still a relatively short period of time compared to retirement for example unfortunately many financial planners use the same approach to plan for retirement or to produce other longrange plans that is like using a wrench to drive a nail or a hammer to change a flat tire the primary reason that we believe the traditional approach is such a poor tool choice for retirement is two fold  the length of time that one expects to be retired and  the incredible number of variables that must be taken into consideration to make the projection relevant over that period of time recall that the traditional approach asks you to set a date for retirement some will even give you the opportunity to set a date for semiretirement prior to full retirement further it asks you to estimate the amount that will be needed from savings each year it then calculates the total sum that will be needed on that date that will enable you to live long and prosper make a mistake in the calculation or estimation of any of these variables at age  and by the time you reach old age the error will be huge we argue that this approach to financial planning for retirement or any other longlived objective is better for the advisor than it is for you the client the advisor whose fee is determined by assets under management has a clear and compelling interest for you to save even more than may be necessary for example if you ignore any one resource available to you ie social security or funds from downsizing your residence before or during retirement you will automatically oversave overestimate the amount needed in retirement and you will oversave oversaving is almost as bad as undersaving because it comes at the expense of some part of your living standard today let’s be very clear we don’t intend to underplay the importance of saving we know that setting aside money while working in order to provide resources for the years when you do not earn money is vital for most of us underestimate the need at retirement and you will undersave and run the risk of outliving your money the point is that you do not have to rely on guesstimations with the economics’ approach to financial planning most of our clients have told us that their very real concerns about retirement are two fold  outliving their money and  having to reduce their living standard as they age when pressed on the issue they are also concerned about having to reduce their current living standard in order to fund what some financial advisor or online tool has told them is the right amount to save for some this is a valid concern for others it is not the answer to most of these questions and a host of others can be found in the economics’ approach to financial planning it focuses on planning for a smooth living standard for a long enough period that will cover most any lifetime the approach has been popularized by laurence kotlikoff economics professor at boston university and described in his book spend ‘til the end but is built on research by none other than the late irving fisher of yale university the concept of consumption smoothing has been around for over a century but only now have we had the computational power for it to be used efficiently our firm uses kotlikoff’s program economic security planner esplanner it is vitally important to understand that one’s living standard is supported by how much he or she spends each year not how much is in the bank at any given point in time a restatement of our clients’ concerns above implies that most of us would like to have minimal disruption to our living standard throughout the remainder of our lives even if we have very long lives in other words we would like our living standard to be smooth or perhaps enhanced because of the decisions that we make today of course economists tell us that by operating in an inflationary economy such as ours the cost of living will go up more dollars will be required in the future to maintain the same living standard enjoyed today smoothing your living standard means spreading your spending power evenly over time so that you never have to worry about running out of money even as the amount is adjusted for the rising cost of living and even as earnings stop at some point consumption smoothing does take into account the law of diminishing returns that is economists believe that one can have too much of a good thing and that sooner or later another dollar of spending does not yield another dollar’s worth of fulfillment however it also means protecting your living standard—making sure that it stays relatively steady in good and bad times in other words we believe that you do not want to suffer disruptions to your living standard due to adverse changes in income certain expenses taxes government benefits and inflation additionally you would want to make sure that the added risk of choosing one investment over another is actually worth it in terms of its effect on your living standard we acknowledge that financial planning is truly about making decisions we view our job as one which helps you make better decisions regarding a lot of different financial variables thus we define a better decision as one that provides you with more money to spend for the same effort expended the first task then is to determine an amount that represents your maximum spending power this year that will remain smooth for the remainder of your life when adjusted for inflation finally the economics’ approach to financial planning affords you the opportunity to know what it costs to do the things that you really love to do these may include taking a wonderful but lowerpaying job retiring sooner rather than later buying a vacation residence moving to a different climate contributing to charity or any other passion that may be uniquely yours it is easy to quantify the immediate cost of a vacation home but what if you could know the longterm effect of that decision on your living standard for the rest of your life using the economics’ approach we can make that determination so how do we do this  identify and quantify current and future resources first of all we consider the amount of your resources that would sooner or later throughout your lifetime be available to spend to support your living standard resources typically consist of earned income from now until retirement gifts or inheritances but should be included only if they are certain to occur both income and principal if you are willing to spend your capital as you age of investment accounts social security cash value of life insurance policies cash flow generated from the sale of an asset such as a vacation residence or a business interest note because you will always need a place to live we do not consider your primary residence or your personal belongings as assets resources that will be used to fund your living standard you could however instruct us that you would be willing to downsize at some future date or even turn to renting if that made sense we can make modifications to our analyses based on your specific needs and goals  identify and quantify special expenditures there are some things that you will want to be certain get funded even at the expense of your current and future living standard typically these fall into two categories necessary and discretionary the necessary may be to pay off existing debts to fund the cost of longterm care or the premium for longterm care insurance to fund a certain bequest upon death or to fund funeral expenses discretionary goals can be anything that you dream about we add the ongoing cost of your housing to these other expenditures and these make up the “special expenditures” for things that you want to make sure get funded before arriving at the amount available to spend on your living standard  build a base case scenario some will view this as the “most likely” scenario while others see it as the “worst case” to arrive at the base case we assume that taxes will have to be paid at the rates that are currently in the law adjusted for inflation where necessary to calculate the true maximum sustainable living standard we assume that at a certain age we default to age  unless you tell us otherwise you will have all your resources except for your personal residence spent using dynamic programming we are then able to plan backwards from that target age to your current age to determine the amount of spending that will smooth your consumption adjusted for inflation perhaps you can see the complexity of the math that must be involved in such intricate computations the number that arises from this analysis is the maximum amount of money that you will be able to spend this year that can be adjusted for inflation for each year for the rest of your life  plan for improvement in living standard as financial planners our aim is to help you improve both your financial and personal wellbeing by working toward finding a higher smoother and more rewarding living standard once the base case is established and assumptions agreed to we can then build alternative scenarios to demonstrate the effect of our ideas on your living standard some of our ideas have been  increase or decrease funding of a taxdeferred retirement account  convert a traditional ira to a roth  move to a state with lower or no income taxes  downsize residence  pay off debt earlier or later  start social security earlier or later  pay back social security and restart at a later date  retire later andor  annuitize a pension or take a lump sum  provide decision support with scenario planning in addition to our planning ideas outlined just above there are times when clients have particular and pressing questions about their financial lives can i afford  you fill in the blank is working until age  really worth it what is my safe rate of spending in retirement am i saving enough to sustain my living standard should i accelerate payoff of my debt should i have my child borrow money to go to school how much can i afford to give away to children grandchildren or charity each question is also a version of can you raise your living standard can it be preserved can it be sacrificed to some extent in order to reach other goals by now you can see that each of your financial decisions should be evaluated on the merits of its effect on your living standard now and throughout the future having built the base case we can then in very short order quantify the effect of the decision under consideration we can isolate the relevant facts and circumstances of that decision into an alternative scenario and recommend whether a certain course of action will increase or decrease your living standard and by how much imagine how you will feel having made a more fully informed decision the latest on financial planning seven steps to your

team to focus on putting the clients’ best interests first more than three decades of financial expertise are shared by d scott neal’s partners this team has been through the good times upanddown times and the challenging times of the financial roller coaster the team’s passion is enhanced by sensitivity to the unique needs of each person our mission in summing up the firm’s mission scott cited a recent article from gallup “money may not buy happiness but it is hard to be happy if you cannot meet your basic needs beyond that the actual amount of money you have has less of an impact on your overall wellbeing than financial security and how you manage and spend your money financial wellbeing is about effectively managing your economic life” added scott “the d scott neal team is a strong proponent of wellbeing it’s what we are all about we craft strategies for security which are intended to lead to greater wellbeing for our clients jerry and i have surrounded ourselves with a group of professionals who are singularly dedicated to client service” this dedication to service crafted the firm’s unique way of working with clients jerry explained“we help you first calculate the amount of resources that you have today and then partner with you to determine the realistic amount of the resources that you’ll likely have throughout your lifetime improving your standard of living now and throughout the remainder of your life is our focus and passion” our services the firm’s offerings fit into two broad categories broadbased financial planning and investment management services financial planning in developing a financial plan the firm works with families at each stage of life paying particular attention to the key transition periods such as planning and paying for education launching into a career making a job change planning for retirement paying for retirement leaving a legacy investment management a key differentiator with d scott neal is the firm’s fee structure “when i started our firm it was a conscious decision to be an independent feeonly registered investment advisor rather than a representative of a broker dealer” added scott this distinction delivers several benefits to clients money is managed on a continuous basis rather than as a onetime sale as an independent firm d scott neal can select investments from the entire universe of products with only the client’s best interests in mind as a feeonly advisor team members do not collect commissions or work with hidden fees of any kind they only work for the client jerry sums things up “we strive to help our clients simplify their lives and are passionate about helping individuals and families reach their goals we do it with sensitivity to the uniqueness of each person”  d scott neal inc

investments cash flow debt education elder planning tax planning posted on sunday july   how to set “smarter” goals achieve more now comment share tweet print email as financial planners we spend a lot of time helping our clients set goals and reduce them to writing in fact that is one of the standards of professional conduct imposed by the certified financial planners board of standards  nearly every client comes to us with a long range goal in mind ie retire with enough to live on into old age pay for college get out of debt etc we have to pause to ask if the goals welldefined  usually they aren’t in order to become better equipped to help our clients set goals i attended michael hyatt’s best year ever live event earlier this year and have subsequently participated in his activation workshops to build on that experience  i just returned from the second of those workshops designed to assess progress made in the quarter just ended and to refine the goals for next quarter  in the program michael presented a method of “how to set goals” and has graciously granted me permission to share the method with you here you can learn more about michael and his work at michaelhyattcom step  select a life domain  ask yourself where do i want to make progress  these could be in the realm of being spiritual intellectual emotional physical relating marital parental social or doing vocational avocational financial step  state an aspiration  an aspiration is simply an expression of a desire usually it starts with the words “i want   ”  unfortunately we see many clients starting and stopping at this point and the goal remains simply a wish aspirations are important in that our best goals tap into our deepest desires but stopping here cuts the legs out from under our goals as financial planners we listen for critiques that each client places on his or her own financial management for clues related to finding the aspirations step  decide if it is an achievement or a habit goal  achievement goals have a welldefined target that will be easily measured when you get there retire at age x  accumulate x by age y we usually default to achievement goals but we really need to ask whether a habit goal will best serve the outcome we desire a habit goal is used when the aspiration is rather vague and  or hard to measure  a habit goal can often become a means to accomplishing an achievement goal  for example one of my goals is to remain healthy–an achievement goal that will elude me if i don’t have a good habit of exercising every day and getting  –  hours of sleep each night  so one of my  habit goals is “exercise  minutes a day  days a week beginning on january   for  weeks” i figured it would take that long to establish it as a habit given my reluctance to exercise another is “get to bed at a time that will provide  hours of sleep each night starting on january   for  weeks”  i was able to mark these off this quarter because those habits are now firmly installed step  understand the characteristics of each type  michael has developed his own variation of the smart goal i learned smart goals  years ago in the army  he has suggested that both habit and achievement goals need to be smarter  specific measurable actionable risky timekeyed exciting and relevant  “risky” you might ask  he advises that our goals should be in our discomfort zone if we are to make significant progress in the chosen area of life our job as financial planners is often to help clients stay out of their delusional zone  notice that achievement goals and habit goals have different timekeys  achievement goals have a deadline whereas habit goals have a start date habit frequency time trigger and streak target step  write the goal using the appropriate template  start with a verb action include the words that make it specific measurable risky and exciting and end with by  the date  an example would be retire with no reduction in living standard by age    a habit goal will also begin with a verb the action followed by the terms that make it measurable risky exciting and specific which are in turn followed by the habit frequency  time trigger starting date and streak target  an example might be exercise the action every morning for at least  minutes  days a week the measureable and exciting part starting on july  start date for  weeks the streak length which is the time that i think it will take to install the habit often our financial planning recommendations are actually the short term goals that will lead toward the accomplishment of long term goals for example the planner might calculate and advise the client to spend not more than x in order to reach the long term goal of retirement at a certain age if you haven’t set your goals using such framework perhaps your next goal should be “write my goals using a smarter framework by the end of this month  drop down and leave a comment or question july       posted on friday june   news or noise time to focus on what matters comment share tweet print email the steady diet of headlines pouring out of washington has been unsettling for many americans regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum  even lloyd blankfein ceo of goldman sachs jumped into the fray and wrote his first ever tweet criticizing president donald trump’s move to withdraw the us from the paris climate change agreement  one has to ask whether he is truly interested in the environment just wants to compete with trump or if gs holds a lot of twitter stock beaten down lately we all know that equity markets stocks hate heightened uncertainty what is happening in washington is generating an enormous amount of political uncertainty  even the word “impeachment” has been bandied about in conventional circles some pointed to that “news” to explain the oneday selloff that caused the dow to drop  points last month but political as well as international uncertainty has yet to translate into main street economic risk it is here that you and i live  to assess main street economic risk we look at gdp both nominal and real household income consumption and nonresidential fixed investment the standard deviation of those elements is a measure of economic risk according to dr woody brock economic risk has decreased by well over  during the eight decades since  indeed there was a spike in the ’ decade  but so far each of the metrics with the exception of household income has shown a decrease in volatility a standard measurement of risk this decade the economy has improved from a riskiness standpoint many will posit that the fundamentals of the economy extrapolated from the news drive the market if that were the case one could reasonably expect that the risk of the market would have also declined by more than  over those same decades that simply hasn’t been the case in that same period there has been only a  decline in market volatility a standard measurement of risk much will be said about the economy improving and that will likely be given as the reason for this or that happening in the market  in reality it is very difficult for anyone including professionals to make correct investment calls based on the news that’s because mistakes in interpreting the news are rampant remember when nearly everyone believed that house prices almost always go up and almost never drop furthermore the price paid for a house didn’t really matter  that led to overshoot of the price and the ultimate bursting of the bubble we all now know that that belief so widely held by investors was a mistake the news in my opinion represents mere noise  today we must concern ourselves with the prevailing stories that may turn out to be wrong so what should we be concerned about today  a possible list includes excessive debt levels margin debt is at a record high and student loan debt now exceeds other forms of debt increasing levels of pricing model uncertainty  discerning the true value of an investment today is quite different than it was a few years ago before the advent of today’s large hitech companies despite the frequent distractions from the popular press we are keeping a firm eye on the market fundamentals as well as the technical signals to navigate through these uncertain times you might want to turn off the tv and enjoy your weekend and summer june
