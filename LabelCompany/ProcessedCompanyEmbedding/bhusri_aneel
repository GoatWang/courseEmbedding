bhusri thank you michael id first like to also thank everyone for joining our q  earnings call im pleased to report that our first quarter of fiscal year  was one of our strongest quarter todate indeed net new acv experienced our highest yearoveryear growth rate in almost three years our human capital management business remains strong with continued performance across customer size geography and vertical we also had a strong quarter for our financial management suite of applications as we had a  new core financial management customers starting out with workday hcm we had another strong quarter as we continue to lead the market with an industry leading true cloud platform the deepest product capabilities and unparalleled user experience and the highest levels of customer success in q we added target aecom los hotel ph and puma among the wave of new hcm customers we continue to land marque fortune  accounts in part due to our proven ability to support our customers large volumes of data and transactions a capability that neither of our legacy competitors has been able to demonstrate in the cloud while these new wins are very important to us we remain equally focused on delivering excellent service to our current customers and that includes delivering on our commitments to them amongst the many golives of q i would like to highlight qantas airways who became a customer in  and went live after nine months project covering all  employees and contractors in  countries a special kudos to their great effort and excellent project team we also saw a strong momentum for the workday financial management suite of applications we believe that a combination of our expanded set of offerings the cfos increasing comfort with the cloud and our high levels of customer satisfaction are beginning to drive broader adoption of our financial management applications to that end new workday financial management customers in q included nasdaq and adventist healthcare and nuffield health the largest notforprofit healthcare provider in the uk im also delighted to report that in the first month of q we saw a two existing hcm customers st century fox and cna financial corporation expand their use of workday to include our financial management applications taken together with our q success we believe these wins collectively demonstrate both the growing momentum of our financial management applications amongst large companies and the benefit of having a happy hcm customer base in q we also continue to add to our sales leadership team across the globe and are delighted to welcome gonzalez benedict as our new president of emea and apj gonzalez brings a strong background in enterprise applications and will report to chano fernandez our executive vice president of global field operations shifting to the product development front we moved all customers to workday  during q with this update which by the way took less than five hours for all of our customers we expanded our global foundation and industry specific capabilities in workday financial management and delivered a suite of new features in workday hcm that equip customers with even more flexibility to meet their performance to management needs we also continue to deliver against the roadmaps for workday planning and workday learning by adding new features that expand the global breadth and depth of these products indeed these two new offerings continue to perform very well in terms of new sales workday planning now has over  customers as it continuous to be one of the best new product launches in our companys history and workday learning has experienced a similar ramp and now enjoys a base of over  customers as we look forward to the rest of fiscal year  and beyond we will continue our relentless focus on innovation and expect to see continued momentum for our growing family of applications on the hills of the success of workday planning and workday learning we are seeing increased levels of activity around workday financial performance management a new sku we introduced at the start of the fiscal year and high levels of interests in workday prism analytics our advanced analytics offering that will become available with workday  in the fall and stay tuned for some other exciting offerings that we will discuss in the upcoming months i would like to end on a note about a topic that is near and dear to me and dave and the rest of the management team continuing to build a value based organization that stands the test of time in the past year loan we have invested heavily in manager and leadership training including and off sight leadership summit where our  people manager spend two full days learning about our way of managing and leading at workday we also continue to invest in development programs for our individual contributors to drive much of the performance of the company and we believe this investment in our people continues to payoff in the quarter we were named one of the  best companies to work for by fortune and great place to work institute for the third consecutive year ranking number  on this years list we ranked number one in the large company category of the san francisco business times best places to work in the bay area list and rank number one on the great place to work institutes list of irelands best workplaces for  in the best large company category were very proud that even as we maintain our very fast pace of employee growth around the world the company culture remains strong all in all this quarter was a great start to our fiscal year with that over to you robynne robynne sisco thanks aneel and good afternoon everyone as aneel mentioned we continue to execute against our large and growing addressable market the momentum from the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter with strong product adoption for both hcm and financials lets start with our top line results for the first quarter we delivered total revenue of  million reflecting yearoveryear growth of  our subscription revenue was  million up  which represents our third consecutive quarter of accelerated subscription revenue growth subscription revenue outperformance was driven by strong net new acv growth as well as better than normal linearity within the quarter professional services revenue came in at  million representing growth of  we continue to be excited by the expansion of our global footprint total revenues outside the us grew  to  million reaching  of the total revenue for the first time were still early in our expansion outside of the us and this will be an area of continued investment for us our nongaap operating profit for the quarter was  million resulting in an operating margin of  the strength reflects higher top line growth improvement in our gross margins and the benefit of overall spends being lower than expected we did not see any material impact from fx changes within the quarter we achieved a record high for cash flow from operations of  million in q our trailing  month operating cash flow was  million up  yearoveryear our trailing  months free cash flow was  million up  yearoveryear note that in calculating our  month free cash flow weve excluded a  million related to our own real estate investments as we consider such investments nonrecurring in nature as always our cash flow results can vary with the timing of customer invoicing as well as seasonal and varying spending patterns our business model clearly demonstrates strong economics as we scale and were confident in our ability to deliver future operating margin and cash flow improvement over time it is important to reiterate however that given the large growth opportunities still ahead of us well continue to prioritize growth over near term margin improvement moving to the balance sheet total unearned revenue at the end of q grew  yearoveryear to  billion current unearned revenue which will be recognized over the next  months was approximately  billion or strong annual growth of  even with the very strong q on a sequential basis current unearned was relatively flat a result of the compounding seasonality were seeing over time noncurrent unearned revenue was down  yearoveryear driven primarily by fewer customers electing to pay more than one year of subscription fees upfront as we discussed last quarter and as part of our adoption of the new accounting standard asc  were pleased to provide two new quarterly subscription revenue disclosures the first disclosure referred to as our remaining performance obligation under asc  we will simply refer to as our subscription revenue backlog this number represent all future revenue from existing customer subscription contracts regardless of contractual billing schedules this means that amounts already billed which are on our balance sheet in the form of unearned revenue are included in the subscription backlog number as are amounts that will be billed at later date in accordance with the underlying contracts at the end of q our subscription revenue backlog was  billion with two thirds expected to be recognized within the next two years and the remaining balance to be recognized thereafter second we are providing the amount of our subscription revenue within the quarter that was in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the quarter for q  million of our  million of subscription revenue or  came from the balance sheet this compares to q of last year were  million of our  million of subscription revenue also  came from the balance sheet we believe the new disclosures are good proof points in the predictability and longevity of our business and that they will be helpful over the long term we also believe however that there are significant limitations in trying to deduce current period performance using these metrics as they will fluctuate in the short term based on many factors including seasonality contract durations invoicing term the timing of renewal and other contractual dynamics subscription revenue growth continues to be one of the best indicators of our performance from a top line perspective we continue to see the annual dollar value of contracts from renewing customers exceed the original contract value during q supporting our thesis that satisfied customers become long term customers which will drive long term shareholder value we continue to invest in our people and in attracting top talent to workday during q we successfully added and integrated approximately  net new employees to workday bringing our total workforce at the end of the quarter to almost  operationally we executed exceptionally well on the first quarter delivering over performance on both the top and bottom line were extremely pleased with our results and have gotten off to a great start for fiscal  ill now turn to guidance as a reminder all our financial reporting and guidance is under the new asc  accounting standard and our growth rates are calculated using the restated historical numbers provided last quarter based on our strong q results we are raising our fiscal  outlook and providing q guidance as follows for subscription revenue were raising our full year estimate to be in the range of  billion to  billion or growth of  to  we expect our q subscription revenue to be  million to  million or  to  growth the sequential improvement in q and q of  and  respectively this pattern reflects our increasing seasonal trends towards larger q we expect professional services revenue to be approximately  million in fiscal  and  million in q we therefore estimate the total revenue for fiscal  will be  billion to  billion or growth of  to  with q total revenue in the range of  million to  million or growth of  to  for nongaap operating margins we now estimate q and full year operating margins of  to  the sequential decline in nongaap operating margin from q reflects typical seasonality and is primarily a result of our annual employee compensation cycle which took effect at the beginning of q in addition we expect nongaap operating margins to decline quarteronquarter in q to approximately  primarily due to continued headcount growth and seasonal marketing spends before sequentially improving in q the gaap operating margin is expected to be lower than the nongaap margin by approximately  to  percentage points in each remaining quarter and for the entire fiscal year we still expect strong operating cash flow of  million or growth of  as you know following our seasonally strong qs q is consistently our strongest cash collections quarter and correspondingly q is traditionally our weakest we are currently expecting cash flow from operations in q to be negative driven by the combination of seasonally low collections and the seasonally high sequential increase in expenses driven by our annual employee compensation cycle mentioned earlier there is no change to our fiscal  plans for capital expense for our owned realestate projects or other capex provided on our last call and finally i’ll close by thanking our amazing customers partners and employees for their continued support and hard work we are still in the early stages of executing against our longterm vision as a company but our progress wouldn’t be possible without a shared goal we’re off to a great start to the year and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year operator lets begin the qa process questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from justin furby with william blair your line is open justin furby maybe robynne just to start can you give a sense for this new metric on the subscription backlog for q what the yearoveryear compare looks like was it a similar growth rate that you saw in terms of q on backlog or are there any more contracts around q would be helpful and then i’ve got a followup for aneel thanks robynne sisco so if you look back to when we were disclosing backlog previously if you take that backlog number and add in unearned balance you’ll get a total number that was fairly comparable to the new disclosure under  so last quarter we disclosed that amount to be  and then you’ve got disclosures for every yearend previous to that so you’ve got some pretty good points of comparability there if you look back in time justin furby i was just wondering robynne for q of last year what that might have looked like in terms of yearoveryear growth if not sequential robynne sisco we have not disclosed q of last year justin furby and then  i thought id try aneel i haven’t asked this question in at least a few years i wanted to take a shot at it again just based on what you see today in terms of financials and traction in pipeline how long do you think it is for that product line would reach parity with hcm from a new booking standpoint and when we get there whenever it is what sort of growth story do you think workday has at that point aneel bhusri these questions are hard to predict so its still several years down the road weve seen really nice pipeline growth in financials we talked about the two big wins actually i put nasdaq in the  through the three big wins nasdaq st century fix and cna so were beginning to see that market move and that market is bigger at the same point though the hcm market has a lot of legs in front of it and if you look at the reacceleration in this subscription growth rate thats still primarily driven by hr and that hr needs to slow down for finance to reach parity at some point and were not seeing that we dont want to see that but id say its clearly down the road but now this finance business is becoming more predictable and its growing faster but the hr business is really holding its own right now operator your next question comes from kash rangan from merrill lynch your line is open kash rangan a couple of questions for you robynne and aneel one is you said that acv growth rate was the fastest in almost three years can you help us understand what exactly drove acv growth rate and what could have been otherwise a seasonally slow q and also is this a precursor that deferred revenue growth and how we calculate billings should also accelerate just because acv growth rate was so solid and if i could  actually someone asked the backlog question so this is the only question for me aneel bhusri so in terms of q id say it was strong execution and ill turn it over to chano in a second to talk about it but very strong sales execution and i do think that were seeing this phenomenon that especially in large companies in the market that are out in the market for an hr system were just so far ahead of our main competitors in terms of proof points of success so if youre fortune  company weve got dozens of  actually over  points of success and not just winning the account but the customers actually in production and our competition has very little and we just saw some of those actually trickle into q which historically hasnt seen a lot of fortune  accounts but we did as well maybe chano you want to add something to that chano fernandez i think companies continue to move to the cloud clearly as the leader in hcm and financials we continue to gain share i think the momentum from q continue in q on both medium enterprise and large enterprise were strong and clearly as aneel mentioned were at the beginning of our global expansion so we had a trickle quarter outside of the us and we continue really excited about the opportunity ahead of us robynne sisco kash on your billings question as you know we stopped guiding that because we dont believe the billings number really correlates to any meaningful metrics that are good to gauge our current period performance so it will continue to vary as it has against the other metrics that we do manage to give like net new acv kash rangan appreciate that robynne but nonetheless acvs growth rate should lead to something else accelerating as the rest of the year progresses i would assume it has a lag effect i would assume aneel bhusri well so kash the thing to understand is that given now that the revenue recognition rules have changed were not as focused on getting a years worth of cash or more than a years worth of cash up front it doesn’t impact revenue recognition and frankly that gives us more tools in the bag to potentially lower discount rates right there is only so many knobs you have and not pushing the customers on cash means you might be able to avoid some additional discounting so were just not focused on collecting cash in the same way that weve  its kind of odd because your name is kash but were not focused as collecting as much cash as we have historically kash rangan wonderful aneel bhusri it doesn’t matter to our revenue recognition anymore kash rangan thanks so much operator your next question comes from alex zukin with piper jaffray your line is open scott wilson this is scott wilson on for alex aneel maybe one for you and then a followup for robynne a large contender and here is over the last month or two technical difficulty senior leaderships of their hcm competitive alternative just curious if you have any thoughts on these changes and as a result any changes in some kind of deals dynamics aneel bhusri our large competitors change their leadership in the field on what seems a pretty regular basis so i think the previous individual was as highquality person if i think that the companys sap so im not sure what that means other than our win rate against both sap and oracle has been consistently high and i think it will continue to remain consistently high scott wilson got it and then robynne maybe a bigger picture question got you i think some people have kind have been trying to get at this but setting aside kind of invoicing flexibility and billings seasonality and it would seem as though bookings growth is outpacing kind of billings growth and even subscription revenue growth given that its been the strongest in the past three years so what is the metrics that you kind of point us to to judge your quarterly success i guess robynne sisco yes so scott we believe that the best top line metric is really subscription revenue growth and while there is a little bit of a lag effect there because we guide we think thats the best insight to give you in terms of how we are doing scott wilson got it alright thanks guys operator your next question comes from karl keirstead from deutsche bank your line is open karl keirstead thanks maybe two questions for robynne robynne back on the seasonality issue if you look at total differed revenues it was i think down  yearago it was plus  so maybe thats an example of the seasonal impacts that youve been highlighting so i guess my question is as we look out to the rest of fiscal  should we expect in q and q to have that similar dynamics sort of less sequential dr growth compared to the year ago and then q perhaps better just directionally does that make sense and ive got a separate followup robynne sisco yes so i think what were seeing right now what were seeing is our compounding seasonality and as you look at one of our large peer companies you see the exact same dynamics its just because they are a little more mature than we are it took us a little while to hit that i don’t think for this year we would expect sequential declines in the next few quarter over the year but overtime we certainly could more closely follow the pattern of over a large peer on that front karl keirstead okay thats helpful and then maybe a separate question on the service to side it looks like thats where a decent chunk of the revenue outperformance versus your guide came in q and your guide robynne for services was  million on q suggests that growth will be pretty good is there anything happening on the services side worth calling out robynne sisco were just seeing very strong new contracts from the services side and good execution so nothing really in particular just continued growth on that front if you look at the yearoveryear growth we still are seeing declines because as you know we view professional services as a vehicle more for customer success getting customers live than for driving revenue growth karl keirstead got it okay thank you very much operator your next question come from kirk materne with evercore your line is open kirk materne aneel weve obviously heard a lot about the bigger deals over the last quarter or two but i was kind of curious just on your commentary round the commercial business and some of your efforts in the midmarket and how those are going and maybe just an update on the competitive environment there aneel bhusri so we had a very strong quarter competitively against both ultimate and netsuite i think that probably the part that we anticipated was the netsuite one our win rate is the highest it’s been against netsuite in some time at the same point the number of competes against netsuite dropped pretty significantly so i do think that they are in some disarray over there so were not seeing them as much in the competitive market part of it is were also moving up market but when we do see our win rate expanded in q kirk materne if i could just ask a really quick follow up for robynne just robynne on cash flow you guys obviously outperformed this quarter but  not only in cash flow but on margins but youre leaving the cash flow guide sort of in place for the full year i assume some of thats just seasonality through the year you mentioned that you sort of maybe little bit too conservative on spending in first quarter so i expect you guys might be accelerating a little bit on that front can you just talk about sort of the sort of the factors that led leaving cash flow growth for the full year or guidance for the full year alone robynne sisco yeah kirk i mean we were very pleased with our cash flow results for q but they were in line with what we had expected for the quarter as aneel mentioned previously we have less of a focus on getting multiple years of cash upfront from customers so that is also the factor in our annual guide for cash flow and the years early so we just need to see how it unfolds over time kirk materne understood thanks for answering the questions operator your next question comes from keith weiss with morgan stanley your line is open unidentified analyst hi this is justin ph for keith weiss robynne i know its in the press release you certainly called it out the margin and the cash flow performance so dovetailing from the previous question have you guys thought about introducing sort of a framework some of your saas peers have done something similar where they look at various scenarios of growth you know   and then give investors sort of a framework about how to think about margin expansion and margin levels over time have you guys thought about introducing that now that were sort of in positive operating margin territory now for workday robynne sisco yeah its something we have thought about and that we will do it some point in time were not quite ready yet but we realize that its important to give you some more longerterm visibility so youll hear more from us on that front at some point in time unidentified analyst then as a quick follow up on the international side of the business you delivered some healthy growth i was wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of the penetration what your view of penetration rates are in the us versus europe versus maybe rest of world where do you see the opportunities at acm and how long will it take for financials to follow chano fernandez we are still in early days globally for hcm the period that us markets are more mature but opportunities outside of the us remained robust and i think aneel commented on the financial structure and following the hcm going forward aneel bhusri i would add that nuffield health in the uk is a great data point its a very large healthcare organization in the uk and they subscribed to all of our hr and financial products so its not a medium size its a large enterprise that chose us for finance in the uk and i think that’s a good sign and a good start to selling financials outside the us operator your next question comes from mark murphy with jp morgan your line is open mark murphy aneel in the past you have mentioned one of the drivers of your opportunity set being the cycle of the legacy deployments that people saw in sap that are becoming fully depreciated or outdated or are for some reason being sunsetted and i am just curious what you’re observing there in terms of the vintaging of those replacement cycles in hcm and financial and i think what some of us are trying to get at is just the sustainability of this incredible wave of large shield winds that you’ve had and whether this feel sustainable for a while to you aneel bhusri so we’re now getting into the later versions not the really old versions but the later versions of the legacy systems coming off maintenance and so i do believe that’s a factor and i am not sure what’s happened in the past two quarters but activity has definitely picked up there’s no question about it in q and q my other hypothesis is that the cloud at least for hr is clearly moving to mainstreet and its becoming more accepted historically retail has not been one of the industries that’s been an early adopter of new technology its been historically technology and financial services the hightech and the finservices worlds have been early adopters so now as its getting to some of these markets like healthcare and retail i think its telling you that we’re moving into another level of adoption of hr and the cloud and at the same time the systems even the most current legacy systems are coming off maintenance so i think there are a couple of factors at work right now mark murphy and also as the followup to that i wanted to ask are you seeing cases where you can allow companies to put a workday financials kind of a front end on top of a legacy financials backend with the help of connectors if you will kind of creating a reporting layer on top of that existing financial system as a preliminary step to ultimately displacing the general ledger in the future aneel bhusri absolutely that was actually a big driver of our financial performance management sku which we introduced at the start of the sales here be able to bringin not just the financial reporting but actually planning analysis and consolidations into an environment likely that’s already an hr customer and come back for the gl later and that is a newer initiative but the products are actually fairly mature with the exception of planning that’s getting mature quickly and we’re definitely getting traction with that message and with that offering and so i think it just need continued pushing of that offering into our customer base and to our prospect base operator your next question comes from mark marcon with rw baird your line is open mark marcon on the hcm side i missed the total number of new logos that you may have brought onboard and then i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the source of growth there splitting it out between new logos versus existing clients bringing on new module aneel bhusri so we didnt announce the hcm number and well do it from timetotime we announced the financials number just because there seems to be so much interest in that number i think just at a high level a lot of that growth was driven by new accounts as opposed to selling back into the installed base that still is a big opportunity in front of us there is definitely some of it at every quarter but mostly q was landing new accounts mark marcon and then with regards to the big accounts that you ended up mentioning like target did they bring you on for all modules or was it primarily the hcm backlog aneel bhusri im not exactly sure i know its core hr i believe its at least the couple of the modules well get back to you on that  well get back to you on that one i mean some of these larger ones they start out with the core hr project come back for payroll recruiting and learning later but well get to the exact details of that maybe in the callback operator your next question comes from richard davis with canaccord your line is open richard davis i think i recall at the analyst day there was some discussion about kind of opening up and building out a platform strategy where you have your kind of partners and isvs ph and things like that where are we on that angle aneel bhusri well i alluded in my script that theres other exciting announcements coming down the path this year ill probably just leave it right there i would just say that weve been working on that initiatives since david clark committed to at that financial analyst meeting in the fall so and we had actually been working on it for a while before that so just stay tuned richard davis got it and then just a real quick followup i mean you guys have done a good job of building a good reputation for a good culture are you guys on track in terms of hiring for your sales and development staff how does that field these days aneel bhusri ill answer development piece and ill ask chano to comment on sales we continue to hire very well on the development front i would say that that silicon valley is just more challenging than it has been both in terms of not just competition but just the cost of living here so weve been relying more on places like boulevard colorado and dublin ireland to begin building out our development organization so were finding the talent its maybe not all in silicon valley the way it was five to seven years ago chano fernandez on the second front the company is becoming more attractive as appealing to customers satisfaction and innovation and were on track we just to continue to be focused on the right mix between culture performance and cultural fit operator your next question comes from brad reback with stifel your line is open brad reback a little while ago you guys filed the mid shelf can you give us some sense of what use of proceeds might be for given the magnitude of the balance sheet right now robynne sisco yes brad we actually had a shelf registration that expired just a short time ago until this is just replacing that before we filed our next q which will be tomorrow there is no current intended use for that shelf registration at this time operator at this time we have only time for two more questions our next question comes from ross macmillan with rbc capital markets your line is open ross macmillan one for aneel and one for robynne aneel coming into this year you had alluded to the fact that you’re going to be as you focused on maybe selling edge financial applications as core financial applications but it sounds like q got off to a stronger start on the core financial applications so i was just curious as to whether that was driven by any additional incentives whether its in sales force whether its driven by just deals closing faster than you expected just curious for any color around why you maybe got positively surprised on strength of financial management core in q aneel bhusri i would attribute it to two things chano has brought focus to financial sales not that we didn’t have it before but i would say more intense focus to financial sales and we just executed really well and i’d also say that the strength of financials wasn’t limited to core financials it included strength and planning which we alluded to in the press release  in the script expenses projects i mean really across the board and so not just limited to core financing it was just the strong quarter across the board and i think its a couple of things there is no question that finance market is moving into the cloud we’re all trying to figure out the pace at which its moving into the cloud and what we’re seeing is we’re beginning to see healthy levels of adoption and our sales force getting more focused and getting better frankly at selling financials ross macmillan and robynne one for you just on the contracted recurring backlog i heard you give us something on duration but it was a little confusing to me i sounded like you gave us a two year recognition and then beyond two years i felt we were maybe going to get something more like an average duration maybe you could just recap on what you said and how we should think about your disclosure and duration going forward thanks robynne sisco so what i said was the twothirds of that  billion number would be recognized as revenue over the next two years we thought long and hard about what the right disclosure should be to give you guys some color around term you have a lot of information around what’s going to roll off over the next  months including subscription revenue guidance from us including the unearned current balance on the balance sheet so we thought that giving you a little further out would help give you some color on that duration the disclosure requirements are pretty flexible on what we can do so we were trying to find something that was quite useful as our peers adopt next year if there’re other conventions that seem to emerge amount that front then we’ll certainly take a look and reevaluate the way we’re disclosing it at that time operator our final question comes from pat walravens with jmp securities your line is open matt spencer this is matt spencer on for pat thank you for taking my question if you wouldn’t mind could you please just explain some of the demand drivers you’re seeing within learning and also who in particular are you competing against there thanks aneel bhusri i’d say its the same demand drivers we’re seeing across the other products its the benefits of moving to the cloud the better user experience but then i’d add that our learning products its just different what else is on the marketplace it’s a lot more than just the administration and tracking of classes its the ability to create content track that content and really engage the employee base on how they are learning within the organization much more like a corporate youtube i think in some places were replacing some of the best degree players and in other places were coexisting for the time being were not really necessarily focused on replacing were focused on delivering learning to our customer base if they chose to replace an existing system great so i know weve replaced success factors learning quite a few times i suspect that were replacing cornerstone in some places in other places weve partnered with cornerstone operator we thank you for your participation in todays earnings call you may now disconnect and have a great day
