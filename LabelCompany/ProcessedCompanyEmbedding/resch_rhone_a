pro technical editor david brearley spoke on the phone with rhone the day after president obama’s inauguration and again after passage of hr  the american recovery and reinvestment act on feb  db you must be optimistic about working with the new administration do you think we will see progress on global warming legislation what form do you think this legislation is likely to take and what kind of schedule do you anticipate for a vote rr yes we are absolutely going to see global warming legislation introduced this year it will be in the form of a capandtrade program it will be a fairly substantial rewrite of the bills we saw last year you now have henry waxman as the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and congressman ed markey leading the climate initiative so you have two very pro commandandcontrol officials who are going to lead the effort to pass this legislation my sense is you will see legislation developed over the course of the next  or  months that will be very favorable for solar energy it will include substantial incentives as well as opportunities for solar to participate in the carbon marketplace i think the big effort that we are making as an industry is to ensure that those technologies that generate carbonfree electricity are able to monetize that carbonfree generation and to receive credits for it that certainly hasn’t been the case in the past db what seia asked for in the second round of the stimulus package changed in a meaningful way the investment tax credit is secured for  years but seia announced that it would like to see that credit changed to a tax refund can you put this in perspective for our audience rr the problem for an economy in a recession is that the typical tax equity players are no longer participating in the tax equity market in  and  there were about  companies that participated in this tax equity market today there are only five so monetizing the investment tax credit for solar or the production tax credit for wind has become much more complicated and expensive and even though we had a longterm extension of our tax credits the economy is making that incentive unusable at this point what we have asked congress and the administration to do is adjust the tax credits so that they can be used during a recession originally we asked for refundability this would have meant that if you didn’t pay taxes this year you could still get  of the cost of the system it would come in the form of a refund from the treasury we received a lot of pushback on refundability if we get that every industry out there with a business tax credit is going to ask for refundability therefore legislators are unwilling to go there then we said “what about a grant program” they are open to the idea of having the tax credit monetized through a direct grant if you put in a  million solar system you would be eligible for a  grant from doe the catch of course is that the solar energy system has to be put into service within  years this is a shortterm stimulative measure to try to keep the industry growing we have also made some other adjustments to the investment tax credit in this bill that i think are very important—slightly esoteric but very important the first is subsidized energy financing if you receive a low interest loan from a community or state program you have to decrease the basis on which you take the  tax credit by the full value of the loan so if you have a  system and you get a  loan—and that loan is at a  interest rate—currently you can’t use the federal tax credit what we have done is remove that subsidized energy financing clause so if you do receive low interest loans you can still use the  tax credit this is particularly valuable to a program like the one in berkeley california which is simply the city issuing bonds that it will use to finance the installation of solar in homes and businesses homeowners then have an increased property tax assessment on their homes for the amount of the solar system they can pay that off over time through their property taxes the beauty of this program is it becomes a very low interest loan to homeowners and small businesses it removes the upfront cost of installing solar almost completely if someone were to sell the house or the building the solar energy system conveys as property to the next owner you eliminate the whole issue of people not wanting to install solar thinking they will sell their house within  years view as one page pages  next › last » article discussion log in or register to view article discussion related

credit extensions  tuesday december    wwweenewsnet advertisement eetv renewables seias resch discusses industrys tough climb on tax credit extensions onpoint aired tuesday december   with congress overlooking renewable energy tax credit extensions during its final days in session for the year what are the next steps for the credits and renewable industries during todays onpoint rhone resch president of the solar energy industries association explains how a lack of the  treasury grant will impact investments in the solar sector he also previews the outlook for the extension of other tax incentives that are set to expire next year transcript monica trauzzi hello and welcome to onpoint im monica trauzzi joining me today is rhone resch president of the solar energy industries association rhone great to have you back on the show rhone resch thank you monica for having me monica trauzzi rhone its been a tough climb for the renewable energy industry on tax incentives this year senate finance chair max baucus says he plans to take up tax credits at the beginning of next year rhone resch right monica trauzzi but the industry was really hoping to get this resolved sometime this month whats your take on this new timeline and the fact that were not going to see an extension this year rhone resch were disappointed i represent about  businesses in the united states most of them are small businesses whove been using the  treasury program very effectively this program has supported over  solar projects across  states and so weve gotten to a point where this is an effective job creating mechanism thats about to expire so here you have one of the fastest growing industries in the country were about to see a significant dropoff when this program expires at the end of the year so were disappointed but obviously were working within the congress is timeline well be back here in the new year and hopefully it will get it extended monica trauzzi do you think that there is a majority of support in congress for the renewables industry and these continued tax extensions rhone resch you know part of the problem i think with the approach the congress is taken towards renewables is theyre giving these one year twoyear kinds of extensions rather than making them over a longer duration and then curtailing them after you dont need them the  program was created to deal with a very tough economic climate where you didnt have enough tax equity in the market to support growth of these industries well this program is still needed today because you dont see those tax equity players have come back into the market yet so here we have a very effective program that is absolutely critical that we keep going i think in the long run what you see is that congress understands this is good policy this kind of program creates jobs im seeing you know development in my district in rural nevada or in colorado or in texas and i never thought the renewable industry would be in my home state so you know here you have a program thats effective and is really supporting job creation throughout united states again difficult to deal with these shortterm durations though monica trauzzi  brought some impressive numbers for q for the industry how do you think a lack of that program might affect future growth rhone resch well its important to point out the good things that are happening in solar industry today we grew by  percent year over year in the third quarter we installed about  megawatts just in the third quarter thats more than we installed in the entire year of  so those small businesses who maybe theyre electricians or homebuilders who have gotten into the solar industry are seeing their business grow and thrive the big question is what happens january  what happens  days from now when this program expires i think for small businesses theyre going to find it extremely difficult if youre a large business you can go to wall street and get some tax equity for a  million or a  million project but if youre a small developer whos doing   projects you dont have the ability to go to wall street so theyre the ones who are going to be hurt most we estimate that a oneyear extension of this program will create  additional jobs in the solar industry alone none of those jobs are going to be created unless  is extended monica trauzzi the industry performed at slightly lower than expectations for the year how do you account for that is it the uncertainty that exists right now rhone resch well growing at  percent year over year is pretty good were the fastest growing industry in the united states today and i think the other great news is that weve seen the price of solar come down dramatically as we have scaled up the industry the cost of solar panels has come down by percent in the last year alone so theres almost no better time to go solar than today and i think a lot of people are kind of looking at their energy bills going through the roof and saying hey solar has come down its more cost effective theres new business models where i dont have to pay them any money upfront were going to invest in solar now so i would say actually weve done extremely well as an industry even in these tough economic conditions in order to grow all market sectors monica trauzzi so with all of this great progress then why does the industry continue to need these incentives rhone resch well as you know monica every single sector of the energy industry is built on policy and built on some form of support for the solar industry we have an underlying  percent tax credit thats in place out through  but if you cant use those tax credits to develop your project you have no ability to finance that project so the  program was created to address the inadequacies in the market those inadequacies still exist today unfortunately and so what i think ultimately is critical is that we create the policies for renewables that are similar to what you see for the oil and gas industry which are permanent incentives or you know the kinds of policies that last long enough so you have business certainty especially for proven job creators like solar monica trauzzi have you noticed a shift in tone in congress towards renewables and just the outlook for the role that renewables will play in our energy policy rhone resch theres no doubt i mean you see congressmen starting to talk very positively about solar not in the future but today new factories being opened up throughout the united states largescale projects that we couldnt even dream of five years ago are now under construction and frankly almost everybody knows somebody working in solar today thats a big difference from where we were just a couple of years ago so weve made a very aggressive transition from being kind of a nice cute you know technology or an issue really into an industry an industry that employs over  people in the united states and as i mentioned is the fastestgrowing industry in this country and we expect to add another  to  this next year alone if we have that policy certainty monica trauzzi i want to shift gears slightly and talk about the role that china is playing in the us solar industry do you think that the us industry is disadvantaged because of chinas production of solar technology and its exportation of solar technology rhone resch well we have a global marketplace for solar meaning we export and import products here in the united states in fact in  we were a net exporter of solar equipment products and finalfinish product to the tune of having a trade surplus of over  billion with the rest of the world in fact we were a net exporter to china now what were seeing is the major investment in new manufacturing of the finished product is occurring in china and so theyve scaled up their manufacturing and lowering their perunit costs so that they are able to compete globally now unfortunately we havent made that same investment in the united states for a lot of companies and so competing with a lower cost product is proving very very difficult its exactly what we saw with solyndra where here you had a technology and a business model that was based on a price point in the market that was good  and  numbers well as i pointed out the price of solar has come down  percent in this last year alone so you have to be efficient in your manufacturing you have to lower your costs in order to be cost competitive and for some companies in the united states theyre not able to do that a the united states theyre not able to do that but the same holds true for some companies in china and in europe and in other places so as the cost comes down for solar there are going to be some companies that go out of business but in the long run thats healthy for us to expand the use of solar and ultimately deliver clean electricity to the customer monica trauzzi all right well end it right there thank you

read preview magazine article un chronicle giving life with the sun the darfur solar cookers project by resch rhone kaye noah read preview article excerpt for the  displaced citizens of darfur living in refugee camps in chad the simple task of cooking a meal poses serious risks since wood for cooking is scarce in the desert region refugees must travel several miles outside the camp to gather firewood where they are highly vulnerable to attacks by the janjaweed militia and other predators a  report by medecins sans frontieres found that  per cent of rape attacks occur when women are outside the populated villages usually while searching for firewood but in the iridimi camp with  refugees in eastern chad families have cut their firewood use by  to  per cent using simple solar cookers to prepare their meals most solar cookers work on sunlight being converted to heat energy that is retained for cooking while there are many successful designs the most adaptable to the needs of refugees is cookit from solar cookers international which is made of cardboard or other local material and is cut into a specific shape to effectively reflect the solar light rays toward a black metal pot the pot when painted black on the outside absorbs and retains solar heat a clear polypropylene bag tied around it creates an insulating barrier and allows the pot to easily reach degrees fahrenheit about degrees celsius which is more than enough to cook several litres of food in a few hours illustration omitted the kozon foundation a dutch nongovernmental organization that trains women in developing countries to solarcook brought the devices to the iridimi camp for the first time in february  after it obtained funding from the dutch foundation for refugees and a project approval from the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr kozon volunteer derk rijks and chadian trainee marierose neloum provided  cookers to several women refugees for a demonstration which proved to be a success a second demonstration was organized in april  in which kozon trained and tested the ability of the refugees themselves to manufacture  cookers emphasizing the creation of a selfsustaining economic activity a basic workshop completed in february  provided the necessary tools and space for the manufacture of the cookers several refugees were also trained as auxiliary trainers who would teach others how to solarcook the solar cooker project accelerated in may  when a coalition of  synagogues in southern california in the united states the jewish world watch jww stepped in to fund the largescale introduction of the cookers throughout the iridimi camp … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over  million more from
