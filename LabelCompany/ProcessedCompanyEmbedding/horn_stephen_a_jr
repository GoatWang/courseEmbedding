a heart condition that causes the upper chambers of the heart to contract randomly creating an irregular or abnormally fast heartbeat atrial fibrillation often occurs alongside other heart conditions medication may be prescribed if the condition is causing discomfort or if there are underlying conditions atrial fibrillation increases the risk of potentially fatal cardiovascular complications including stroke full description atrial fibrillation also called afib is a heart condition that causes an irregular or abnormally fast heartbeat when at rest the heart normally beats between  and  times per minute a person with atrial fibrillation may have an unpredictable heart rate or a resting heart rate of over  beats per minute when the heart beats the muscle walls around it contract forcing blood out and around the body when the muscles relax the heart fills back up with blood in atrial fibrillation the upper chambers of the heart contract randomly they often contract so fast that the heart muscles cannot relax properly between contractions this reduces the heart’s efficiency and performance abnormal electrical impulses can start firing randomly overriding the heart’s natural pacemaker creating an irregular pulse ratewhile the exact cause of afib is unknown it is more common in certain age groups and can be triggered by drinking or smoking it commonly occurs in conjunction with other conditions such as high blood pressure atherosclerosis and heart conditions individuals with atrial fibrillation may not have any symptoms some people are aware of a change in heart rate or experience chest pain dizziness shortness of breath fatigue and palpations while the condition is not directly lifethreatening atrial fibrillation increases the risk of serious complications including stroke and heart failure paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may come and go and stops within  hours without treatment persistent atrial fibrillation may last as long as  days depending on treatment longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation is continuous atrial fibrillation that occurs for more than a year permanent atrial fibrillation is the most severe form and is present at all timestreatment for atrial fibrillation varies depending on the person the symptoms and the severity of the condition treatment focuses on supporting comfort and preventing complications medication can be used to help prevent a stroke as well as control heart rate and heart rhythm in some cases the heart can be given a controlled electrical shock to restore normal rhythm in extreme
