injectionmolded plastic gaming chips became one of the most popular american styles of chips used in european far east asian and south african casinos jones in fact sold more chips overseas than he did in the united states through an exclusive british distributorby the s the bud jones company had customers in more than  casinos in  nations around the worldalong with endy jones became one of the most trusted and wellloved vendors in the business bud jones is also a member of the gaming hall of fame his greatest love was in overseeing the production of his precisioncrafted dice and gaming chips for personal reasons he named no successor and because jones shared the same values as bg ceo gérard charlier he sold his business to the french company in gpi will surely take good care of the business that was bud’s passion and will continue the tradition of quality craftsmanship and service that jones personified for some  years   paulson gaming supplies paul s endy jr had gaming supply in his blood born in monterey park california in  he worked as an electrician before going into sales and service at his father’s business a gaming supply distributor and dice manufacturer called tr king  companypaul sr’s business which endy joined in the early s would provide the seeds that paul jr would eventually turn into the top gaming supply company in the nation in  with the help of his father endy and a partner curley ashworth bought a bankrupt dice company in las vegas because endy brought his three sons in to help run the business and in a tribute to his own father he decided to name his new company paulson gaming supplyit would be gaming chips that paulson would become most known for endy’s company developed custommolded clay chips with personalized inlays—intricate graphics photography and other features never before seen on a chip—and a constantly increasing number of anticounterfeiting features over the years the security features built into the clay chips became more and more sophisticated after the merger with bourgogne et grasset and thanks to their knowhow and a long established experience in adding security features to a chip paulson security features culminated in the development of the microchipembedded chip in  paulson also began offering its clay chips to home poker enthusiasts through its paulson pro series retail chip line and continues to develop and produce new and unique limited edition designsby the s paulson had grown with the industry establishing offices around the united states and nurturing relationships with table game operators both in las vegas and atlantic city the explosive growth of the industry in the early s with emerging riverboat and indian casinos added more customers which prompted endy to take his company public in  an initial stock offering transformed paulson gaming into paulson gaming corporationthe new public company offered an expanded product line that included not only chips and dice but playing cards table layouts and other equipment making paulson a onestop shop for everything in table game supply the expanded product offerings and burgeoning business necessitated a manufacturing facility much larger than paulson’s las vegas headquarters so the company established a plant in san luis mexico to handle production of all paulson productspaul endy jr died in april of  leaving a legacy not only of the best in table game supply but of the best in service to the communities in which he operated endy had served as chairman and director of westcare a nonprofit treatment center for drug and alcohol abuse and contributed to numerous other community organizations including high school baseball unlv baseball and the boy scouts of america in mexico he and his wife funded the expansion of a home for elderly women and contributed extensively to local orphanagespaul endy is a member of the gaming hall of fame and gpi aims to continue that tradition   bourgogne et grasset bg the company that is now the gpi sas subsidiary of gaming partners international corporation was known to casino operators across the globe for decades by the names of the two pioneers of table game supply who were its founders bourgogne et grasset or as it was more commonly known bgbg’s mission—which carries on in the form of gpi sas —was always to provide the highest quality chips plaques and jetons and more recently roulette wheels while working with its customers to ensure the highest level of security possible for the sensitive equipmentin fact security was the main reason for the founding of bourgogne et grasset in the s in beaune in the burgundy region of france lithographer etienne bourgogne and engineer claudius grasset were working to pioneer the use of plastics for use in items such as brooches hair slides and plastic playing cards the partners were the first to master the art of plastic film printing one day in  claudius grasset read in the newspaper le figaro that a player had broken the bank at the monte carlo casino to the tune of  francs and after he had left the casino’s managers realized he had done it with counterfeit chips made of solid ivory and mother of pearlbourgogne and grasset saw an opportunity to use their plastics research and their technical skills to address the counterfeiting problem the partners got to work on producing a new generation of chips that would offer casinos total security they perfected an ingenious process by which the impression of the chip was protected by a thin plastic film which made it practically impossible to imitate themthe partners sent some samples to the general manager of the monte carlo casino monsieur blanc blanc’s reply came in the form of a first chip order and bourgogne et grasset was born as a gaming supplierbg built a solid reputation over its first two decades and in  the company was purchased by another innovator daniel senardsenard who purchased bg following his return from five years in a nazi detention camp during world war ii gave the company a new dimension developing even more security features for the products he added features such as color stripes seethrough windows “lunettes” white and golden lace lamé and invisible prints all groundbreaking anticounterfeiting features that gave bg chips plaques and jetons an unprecedented level of securitysoon the company’s service area had expanded across europe in short order the word was out about the high quality and counterfeitresistant properties of bg products and soon the vast majority of casinos not only in france but in all of western europe were buying their chips from bg the bg logo appeared in germany spain holland belgium italy greece and england and the company’s round chips and rectangular plaques would eventually be dominant in all corners of the world—macau the philippines malaysia australia chile argentina south africa and canada the late shah of iran and the late king farouk of egypt both had their personal chips made in bg’s beaune plantbg always adapted quickly to new challenges and market conditions when the bud jones plastic injectionmolded gaming chip developed in the s and s gained widespread popularity in europe during the s bg developed its own line of “americanstyle” plastic injectionmolded chips and launched it in this was a turning point for bg production expanded dramatically from the traditional jetons and plaques creating a product line with the widest range of gaming chips available on the market daniel senard decided to sell his company in february  to a group of investors led by one of his sons in law gerard p charlier a stanford university graduate who had been on the board of bg since  and involved in the reorganization of bg since  daniel senard died in  with the introduction of the euro in january  as the new currency for most of the eu countries bourgogne et grasset was chosen in  and  as the sole chip and plaque supplier by more than  european casinos that is to say  percent of the market the company’s growing list of customers around the world eventually prompted bg to expand its product line beyond the chips plaques and jetons that had been its mainstay for decades fifteen years ago the company started to manufacture quality roulette wheels in the beaune plant in addition to wheels for both american and french roulette games the company began supplying gaming tables and other supplies until its mission to diversify into a fullservice gaming supply house led executives to the acquisition of the bud jones company in
