technology of carbon nanotubes cnts originally developed at rice university by our founders our technology delivers fibers and films that are made of essentially pure cnts without the use of binders and additives our process is scalable to large volume manufacturing and cost effective dexmat’s cnt fibers and films conduct electricity like metals yet have the flexibility lightweight and corrosion resistance qualities of polymers—the best of both worlds previousnext brief history of dexmat the fundamental technology used by dexmat was developed over the last ten years by a multitude of researchers in prof pasquali’s lab at rice university professor pasquali’s vision to build a  cntbased macroobject from an infinite number of nanosized cnt molecules using a process that could be scaled to large volume manufacturing culminated with the highly cited research paper published in science  jan  pp  late in  dexmat’s founders met in houston to discuss forming a private company to capitalize on the technology the deal was sealed over a few glasses of barolo and amarone the company was incorporated in early february  productsdexmat carbon nanotube products are for detailed

functional group content cnts today are available for industrial applications in bulk quantities of metric ton quantities several cnt manufacturers have  ton per year production capacity for multi walled nanotubes a nanotube may consist of one tube of graphite a oneatom thick singlewall nanotube or a number of concentric tubes called multiwalled nanotubes when viewed with a transmission electron microscope these tubes appear as planes whereas single walled nanotubes appear as two planes in multi walled nanotubes more than two planes are observed and can be seen as a series of parallel lines there are different types of cnts because the graphitic sheets can be rolled in different ways the three types of cnts are zigzag armchair and chiral it is possible to recognize zigzag armchair and chiral cnts just by following the pattern across the diameter of the tubes and analyzing their crosssectional structure multi walled nanotubes can come in an even more complex array of forms because each concentric singlewalled nanotube can have different structures and hence there are a variety of sequential arrangements the simplest sequence is when concentric layers are identical but different in diameter however mixed variants are possible consisting of two or more types of concentric cnts arranged in different orders these can have either regular layering or random layering the structure of the nanotube influences its properties  including electrical and thermal conductivity density and lattice structure both type and diameter are important the wider the diameter of the nanotube the more it behaves like graphite the narrower the diameter of the nanotube the more its intrinsic properties depends upon its specific type here is an overview of the most important and
