proteins which are large molecules that can perform many functions for skin muscle hormones and thousands of other specialized activities proteins themselves are composed of strings of some combination of the same twenty amino acids connected like beads on a necklace the sequence of the beads amino acids determines how the necklace protein folds on itself reacts with water and takes on a shape or function that gives it its unique abilities how does any given cell know how to make a protein it reads the instructions from the source code of dna deoxyribonucleic acid which operates as a blueprint of biological guidelines that a living organism must follow to remain functional dna dna itself is comprised of four nucleotide building block bases shortened as a t c and g every human cell contains dna comprising approximately  billion of these bases in order for a cell to make protein from this dna code the dna is first changed to a sister code called rna ribonucleic acid which contains a similar fourletter coding system rna the different rna letters make up unique threeletter words called “codons” codons tell the cell how to order the  amino acids in the proper order so that the right protein is made individual cells in the body pay more attention to certain sections of the dna than others for example a cell in the stomach may pay more attention to the dna instructions that code for gastric acid while ignoring the instructions that encode for hemoglobin alterations alterations in the dna code such as changing a letter deleting a letter inserting a letter or moving sections around can lead to proteins with abnormal functions if these abnormal functions cause the cell to grow divide ignore regulatory signals or assume new functions cancers can develop fortunately normal cells are good at repairing mistakes should they occur and have multiple systems for ensuring that the dna code is properly transmitted to its two daughter cells when it divides normal cells even have suicide programs if the mistakes are beyond repair a process that causes cell death known as apoptosis passenger vs driver alterations cancer cells typically harbor dna changes or more technically genetic alterations however not all genetic alterations are created equal a key challenge for drug developers like loxo oncology is distinguishing between genetic alterations that “drive” the growth of tumors versus “passenger” alterations which result from the underlying genetic instability of the cancer the automobile references acknowledge that drivers make a car go while passengers are merely along for the ride if by analogy the cancer cell is an out of control car targeting the driver not the passenger is the best way to stop the vehicle types of genetic alterations cancer cells typically harbor dna changes or more technically genetic alterations   however not all genetic alterations are created equal a key challenge for drug developers like loxo oncology is distinguishing between genetic alterations that “drive” the growth of tumors versus “passenger” alterations which result from the underlying genetic instability of the cancer the automobile references acknowledge that drivers make a car go while passengers are merely along for the ride if by analogy the cancer cell is an out of control car targeting the driver not the passenger is the best way to stop the vehicle gene fusion gene fusions occur when chromosomes which carry genetic information break apart and the wrong pieces fuse back together forming a hybrid gene that can activate a signaling pathway or a way cells communicate with each other mutation mutations are the result of a defect in one of the four nucleotide building block “bases” that create dna the human genome contains over six billion nucleotides amplification amplifications are when too many copies of a gene lead to an abnormal amount of protein being produced ultimately the cell can acquire abnormal growth and survival behaviors leading to cancer protein overexpression protein overexpression occurs when a cell produces abnormally high amounts of protein from the dna and rna building blocks gene fusions occur when chromosomes which carry genetic information break apart and the wrong pieces fuse back together forming a hybrid gene that can activate a signaling pathway or a way cells communicate with each other when this happens in a cancer cell the fused gene is like a light switch that’s always in the “on” position causing tumor growth research suggests that gene fusions have a very high likelihood of being driver events in cancer due to the dramatic genetic change that occurs in the cancer cell mutations are the result of a defect in one of the four nucleotide building block “bases” that create dna the human genome contains over six billion nucleotides small changes deletions or insertions in a gene’s nucleotide sequence can change the functional behavior of the final protein leading to cancer however sometimes a mutation has no functional effect on the final protein most cancers simply have hundreds of accumulated mutations that don’t play an active role in tumor cell proliferation the rapid reproduction of cells at loxo oncology we aim to help determine the “driver” mutations vs the “passenger” mutations in order to best predict which patients may derive benefit from our drugs amplifications are when too many copies of a gene lead to an abnormal amount of protein being produced ultimately the cell can acquire abnormal growth and survival behaviors leading to cancer amplifications do not always cause cancer because in some cases the gene amplification does not lead to protein overexpression or the number of extra copies is relatively small it is important to understand which amplifications may predict patient benefit from our drugs protein overexpression occurs when a cell produces abnormally high amounts of protein from the dna and rna building blocks depending on how much of the protein exists in the cancer cell and the context in which the protein is overexpressed this can indicate that the protein is causing the cancer trk fusions our lead therapy larotrectinib loxo is being developed as a targeted cancer therapeutic for tropomyosin receptor kinase trk genetic alterations focused initially on patients harboring trk gene fusions trk consists of a family of three cell receptor proteins known as trka trkb and trkc which are encoded by the ntrk ntrk and ntrk genes respectively under normal conditions trk receptors are found primarily in nerve cells trk receptors become activated when they bind to proteins circulating outside the cell such proteins are referred to as ligands for trk the activating ligands are collectively referred to as neurotrophins neurotrophins bind to trk receptors causing activation of a kinase signaling pathways of kinases these signaling pathways help regulate how neurons function in the setting of pain cognition movement memory and mood when an trk gene abnormally fuses to another gene the hybrid gene that is created as a result causes this process to go awry leading to cancer and driving tumor growth these gene fusions no longer require the neurotrophins to become activated instead they are constantly active simply as a result of the gene fusion event our clinical trials are intended to help understand if loxo can be a safe and effective therapy for patients whose tumors harbor this trk fusion genetic event patients with advanced cancer who seek out tumor profiling or comprehensive cancer genetic testing may discover that their tumor harbors a trk fusion as this genetic event has been described across many tumor types including acute myeloid leukemia astrocytoma brain lowgrade glioma breast cancer colorectal cancer congenital mesoblastic nephroma gastrointestinal stromal tumors glioblastoma multiforme head and neck squamous cell cancer intrahepatic

understanding the biological basis of genetically defined cancers cancer is a disease of the dna with specific cancers often arising from distinct activating gene alterations in the case of any given patient’s specific cancer the “driving” gene alteration orders the cell to continue to divide causing the cancerous tumor to form in order to continue to survive these tumors depend on the continued alteration of this gene and are uniquely vulnerable to any drug that is able to disrupt the faulty signaling pathway loxo oncology is focused on developing therapies for cancers that are uniquely dependent on single gene abnormalities such that a single drug has the potential to treat the cancer by directly inhibiting a tumor’s driving genetic alteration learn more learn more patient resources
