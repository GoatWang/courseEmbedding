robert k hamiltonbaltimore sun another big prime money market fund has changed its stripes the t rowe price prime reserve fund became the t rowe price government money fund effective monday scores of prime money market funds which invest in lowrisk shortterm debt securities and repurchase agreements have either changed to government money market funds or liquidated  this year according to crane data llc which tracks the industry the changes come in advance of new securities and exchange commission rules that take effect on october  the new requirements call for certain funds including institutional prime and taxexempt money market funds to allow their net asset values or navs to fluctuate instead of effectively fixing them at  a share as they currently do institutional funds cater to corporations and other institutions such as pensions and retirementplan sponsors the trowe fund with  billion in assets as of june   had a mix of retail and institutional assets according to portfolio manager joseph lynagh as a result of the new sec rules money market funds under certain circumstances will be granted the authority to impose liquidity fees and gates to prevent redemptions and in some cases be required to do so government money market funds are exempt from such requirements government and retail money market funds also will be able to continue to use the fixed   a share nav the change at t rowe price  will help round out its lineup of money market offerings according to mr lynagh “we wanted a landing spot for all our shareholders” he said the company maintains another prime fund formerly  t rowe price summit cash reserves fund  which was renamed t rowe price cash reserves fund on monday the firm also plans to launch a new institutional  prime money market fund in september peter crane president of crane data said the difference in yield between prime institutional funds which recently yielded  and government money market funds that invest in treasuries yielding  is less than half its historical spread of  hundredths of a percentage point assets held by prime money market funds fell to  billion for the week ended july  the first time since september  that the total has fallen below  trillion according to a spokeswoman for the investment company institute a fund industry trade group the total is down  billion from a week earlier share this cash
