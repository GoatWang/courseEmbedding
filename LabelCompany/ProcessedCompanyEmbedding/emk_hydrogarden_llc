you expect of the company from which you buy your system hydrogardens has been blending chemgro custom hydroponic nutrient formulas since  and has been selling vegetable greenhouse complexes since  hydrogardens began growing hydroponic tomatoes in  and expanded the production facility to  acres during the mid ’s our greenhouse complex was well known in the colorado springsdenver area for its quality tomatoes and european cucumbers the internationally known broadmoor hotel has been a long time customer of hydrogardens’ and we installed their hydroponic facility during the early ’s hydrogardens developed and introduced to the industry the vertical bag system for tomato production this method quickly replaced the flood and drain growing technique then in use during that same period our experimentation and interest led to the introduction of the deruiter line of greenhouse hybrid tomato and european cucumber seed to american growers this line of seed found in our catalog contains the standard varieties that continue to be preferred by most growers in  hydrogardens understood how the changing regulations for insecticide use would soon effectively eliminate them from the growers arsenal we searched through the available predatorparasite producers and obtained the licensing rights to bring those beneficials direct to you the grower in  hydrogardens developed the insect barrier flybarr this is currently the only insect barrier available that does not significantly reduce incoming air flow yet will stop white fly and greatly reduce if not stop thrips from entering your greenhouse we began growing the beneficial nematodes you will find in our catalog that same year introduced in  is a line of organic fertilizers all the products you need to grow healthy
