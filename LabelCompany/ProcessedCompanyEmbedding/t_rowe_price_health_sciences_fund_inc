invest at least  of net assets in common stocks of companies engaged in the research development production or distribution of products or services related to health care medicine or the life sciences while the fund can invest in companies of any size the majority of fund assets are expected to be invested in large and midcapitalization companies riskreward potential click on the riskreward spectrum below to view the funds in that category higher moderate lower this fund offers the potential for longterm growth of capital by investing in companies engaged in the research development production or distribution of healthrelated products or services the health care field is experiencing unprecedented change driven by attempts to hold down costs and by an aging population companies that can provide quality products at competitive prices should perform well technological breakthroughs in areas such as biotechnology can also lead to superior earnings growth due to the funds concentration in health sciences companies its share price will be more volatile than that of more diversified funds further these firms are often dependent on government funding and regulation and are vulnerable to product liability lawsuits and competition from lowcost generic products this chart displays relative risk of each us mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart methodology we evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific riskreturn category on an annual basis a fund is generally placed in a riskreturn category based on the year standard deviation of its performance if a fund is less than  years old the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years for an asset allocation fund with less than  years of performance history substrategy returns are used when a substrategy is less than  years old the actual substrategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years risk return categories overlap a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories denoted by a plus  is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of t rowe price when a fund has a cashlike benchmark denoted by a double plus  its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns if the fund is less than  years old benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate all investments are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal standard deviation of returns a measure of price volatility is one measure of risk please consult the funds
