thank you cheryl and welcome everyone to our first quarter  earnings call we certainly appreciate your continued support and whether youre an employee analyst client investor or valued thirdparty resource we welcome you to the call  first quarter was a very strong quarter were very pleased with our results its a  its part of the process and the stock market keeps score and the metrics keep score but i think it reflects that were just continuing to make progress in the business and as you saw from todays earnings release all major metrics were up significantly across the board we saw doubledigit yearoveryear growth in our cloud sale  and other key metrics including revenue gross margin ebitda sales were up in the double digits so very very pleased with those results we also increased our cloud revenue as a percentage of total revenue to  many of you have asked through the years how do we get our cloud revenue as a percentage to total revenues up and with the  acquisitions and our migration to the cloud and our emphasize in the cloud last year at first quarter we were  this year  which is a big increase as you know migrating existing clients has been a major initiative as well as new sales and its encouraging to see a very clear metric go from  to  and that means that were positioning asure not only for success today in the first quarter but also down the road acquisitions in addition to our improving financials our cloud sales our metrics first quarter was a very dynamic period for us from an operational perspective notably we had  acquisitions personnel management systems inc or pmsi which is a leading provider of outsourced hr solutions when we sell our cloudbased solutions many times clients also want to know how to input or what are the best practices of hr to put into the software and were able to provide that service ultimately nationwide and globally with our acquisition of corporate payroll inc or cpi and psnw which is payroll specialties nw inc were tuckin acquisitions where the service bureaus already had our technology and we were able to buy them and now service them under our payroll hr product this is a model that were going to use going forward more and more were very pleased with the synergies the results the growth that weve gotten out of the  acquisitions that were tuckin acquisitions and brad will provide an overview of the financial terms and later well talk about why this is  the strategic rationale is going to make sense for us to do this again and again and again and we have operational and financial synergies in addition to crosssell opportunities that will continue for years client activity from a client win perspective quarter  was another busy period for us at asure our expanded sales infrastructure we now have  sales reps it enabled us to reach and secure some major wins most notable procter  gamble worldwide we were able to take an account that weve had a very good relationship with nationally and now take that throughout the world that will be a key  a marquee account for us merck is going to the cloud with us pfizer was another strong win and then in the hcm area weve had some real good success with great lakes airlines and atmosphere commercial interiors our sales pipeline in general eyal goldstein our cro came aboard in december we really upgraded in management of that revenue and sales and marketing function and he has had some pretty favorable results so far pipeline is up  from the prior quarter  in a year and the big thing were doing with our salespeople is now our salespeople sell all the products as opposed to product line specific what thats led is crosssell opportunities and its allowed us to have a more effective sales force along that line we also have upgraded the management brad burrows came from adp new position director of client sales brad brings over a decade of experience in helping clients in their hcm or human capital management at workplace strategy as well as organization goals with asure now im very pleased with some of the top level of people that are leading sales and i feel like were going to have further success and were early in that journey of further success finally i mentioned that we have  salespeople theyre entirely selling the platform not just individual products and i would say also weve had visibility to some good wins in the second quarter and some verbal kind of wins that give us confidence for the rest of the year looking at our sales metrics cloud bookings were up  our backlog at the end of the quarter was up  from the prior quarter we continue to expect that our clients will continue to drive through the backlog and will turn to revenue growth however before i go into further detail about our operational progress and our outlook for the rest of  id like to turn the call over to our cfo brad wolfe wholl walk us through the financial details for the quarter brad brad wolfe thank you pat and good morning everyone turning to our financial results for the quarter ended march   revenue for the first quarter was up  to  million from  million in the same quarter last year the increase in revenue was driven by increases in cloud hardware and onpremises software license revenue which was offset by decreases in maintenance and support revenue and professional services revenue our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue improved to  compared to  in the prior quarter and  in the first quarter of  our cloud revenue increased  hardware revenue increased  onpremises software license revenue increased  while maintenance and support revenue declined  and professional services revenue declined  from the first quarter of  and as pat mentioned our cloud bookings in the quarter increased by  from the first quarter of  looking at our revenues by source revenue for our workspace management solution asurespace in the first quarter totaled  million an increase of  from the  million in the same quarter last year asurespace cloud hardware and onpremises software license increased offset by decreases in maintenance and support and professional services revenues cloud revenue increased  or  hardware revenue increased  or  and onpremises software license revenue increased  or  over q last year professional services revenue decreased  or  primarily due to the timing of services in q revenue for asureforce our workforce management solution was  million an increase of  million or  from the  million recorded in the same quarter last year this increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of mangrove in march of  and the acquisitions of pmsi cpi and psnw in january  resulting in  million of revenue in the first quarter of  cloud and professional services revenues both increased driven by a  or  million increase in cloud revenue and professional services revenue of  or  over the same period a year ago these increases were offset by a decrease in asureforce hardware maintenance and support and onpremises software license revenue of  or  as compared to q  primarily in maintenance and support revenue which decreased  or  this decrease was primarily due to the timing and size of contracts and renewals as well as our continued emphasis on transitioning clients from our onpremises to ondemand revenue gross margin for the first quarter was  million or  of total revenue which was consistent with our gross margin of  million or  of total revenue in the prior quarter and a  increase from the  million or  of total revenue in the fourth quarter of  our ebitda excluding onetime items totaled  million compared to  million in the prior quarter and  in the first quarter of  we incurred  of onetime costs this quarter which included  of costs related to the acquisition of pmsi cpi and psnw our gaap net loss totaled  million or  per share which was an improvement from the net loss of  million or  per share in q last year excluding onetime items our gaap net loss for the first quarter of  totaled  or  per share compared to a  or  per share in the same year ago period last quarter we introduced a new metric nongaap net income which we defined as gaap net income excluding stockbased compensation onetime charges and amortization of indefinitely lived intangibles arriving from acquisitions we believe this metric more accurately portrays the operations of our business and provides a clear picture of our financial performance our nongaap net income for the first quarter of  totaled  or  per share which is an improvement from our nongaap net loss of  or negative  per share in the same year ago period please see todays earnings release which is posted on our website for further details including a reconciliation of gaap net earnings to net  before  to net earnings to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and stock compensation expense and ebitda excluding onetime items cash flow used in operations for the quarter was  million an increase of  over q last year included in the cash flow used in operations was  of costs related to the acquisitions of pmsi cpi and psnw id like to turn to our backlog which is defined as sales bookings that have not yet turned into revenue or deferred revenue including both repetitive and nonrepetitive product lines for repetitive products one year of value is included in backlogs our backlog totaled  million a  increase compared to the prior quarter and a  increase from the year ago quarter as pat mentioned we expect many enterprise clients will move through the implementation process throughout  which will result in conversion from backlog to reported revenue growth were also increasing our financial expectation for fiscal  that we presented last quarter we now expect revenue for the full year to be between  million to  million which represents an increase of  to  compared to  for ebitda excluding onetime charges we now expect this metric to range between  million to  million which is a  to  increase over the prior year we also expect our net income per share excluding onetime items to be between  to  which is up from the  we reported in  and finally we now expect nongaap net income per share to be in the range of  to  compared with  we reported last year and finally as pat alluded to in q we acquired pmsi cpi and psnw id like to take a few moments now to provide additional details around the financials related to these acquisitions for pmsi we acquired all the outstanding shares of common stock with the aggregate consideration for the stock consisting of  million in cash and a subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of  million subject to adjustment we funded the cash payment with proceeds from our public stock operating which occurred last december the pmsi note bears interest at an annual rate of  and matures on april   for cpi the aggregate consideration for the assets consisted of  million in cash which we funded from the proceeds from our equity offering as well as subordinated note  promissory note in the principal amount of  and  shares of common stock valued at  million subject to adjustment the cpi note bears no interest and matures on april   the psnw  for psnw the aggregate consideration for the assets consisted of  million in cash and a subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of  subject to adjustment as we did with pmsi and cpi we funded the cash payment with proceeds from our public offering the psnw note bears interest at an annual rate of  and matures on april   this concludes my prepared remarks at this time id like to turn the discussion back to pat who will discuss our operational highlights for the quarter as well as our outlook for the rest of  patrick goepel thanks brad the january acquisitions that brad mentioned some of the detail have already proven to be quite effective financially as well as strategically and strategically cpi provides us a beachhead in the midwest to grow from psnw provides us a beachhead in the northwest to grow from pmsi as we mentioned before will give us a beachhead in the hr outsourcing area to help midsize companies grow and use our software the ma approach that we have where people already use our software we will roll those back up we feel like we have a model thats very very effective i think youll see us do more of those this year and in the future and we feel that thats a good way to grow organically were very very pleased with our sales department they were up big in cloud sales eyal goldstein gets it he is a good leader hes hired some good people both  that report to him we have some good leaders that weve hired in the last  months here with matt absher in charge of benefit sales brad burrows coming from adp in addition to that we have a couple of people that we think very fond of that have been with us a couple of years sharon weldon and where we feel we have the opportunity and the metrics the pipeline has gone way up visibility on some big space deals is high and then the hcm crosssell product where we have  now is our average deal size clearly the january kind of positioning to sell all products is working so with that visibility weve updated our guidance on the revenue side from  million to  million to  million  million i would mention also that the repetitive revenue now at  and the fact that  is cloud has taken that to  in our strategic direction we made significant progress in fact more progress this quarter than anytime over the past couple of years so really really feel pleased that all the hard work for couple of years is starting to come together as far as our channel strategy we do think there are space opportunities available in other channels were growing out that area to  because we do believe that there is more demand worldwide than what we can add feet on the street so i think youll see our channel strategy build out over the next year or  and that will kick in from a sales revenue perspective over the next couple of years this quarter weve had some analyst activity canaccord just recently has covered us i wouldnt be surprised if we have a couple of more analysts interested in the human capital management and space management and our company in particular is very high right now we have our annual client conference coming up and we should have about  of our customers in austin the following week here so excited about the opportunities that that brings in last year at this time we had our initial client conference procter  gamble was at the client conference and has been turned into a multimillion dollar global sale so real excited about where were going from client experience and employee experience financial experience i think the metrics are up we want to keep that going throughout this year and beyond were going to grow organically in addition to some tuckin acquisitions where we already own the software as far as first quarter we will now open the dialogue for questions and love to hear your questions comments and were focused on building the company and taking it to a short term over the next couple of years  million company and beyond so with that questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of david hynes with canaccord david hynes first pat i want to ask you high level maybe just on the ma pipeline what youre seeing out there and then maybe more specifically the cpi psnw model i mean how many of these opportunities are there out there and then maybe you could just talk about kind of the economic value that accrues to you guys by bringing these service bureaus inhouse versus just licensing them your technology patrick goepel yes thank you david and  what we have is we have  when we bought mangrove we had  service bureaus weve acquired  so that would leave  left theyre already using our technology we believe that the best outcome from an exit strategy for those service bureaus is to go to us because theyre already using our technology we have the most possible synergies as opposed to going to another payroll provider because the last thing the end clients want to do is switch software and we also have familiarity with them over years and years and years so were growing our service bureaus and helping those service bureaus grow but were also being opportunistic in providing them an exit strategy as far as the economics we believe that there is almost a  gross margin capability  ebitda capability i should say when you combine the resources because were already hosting the same set of software were already servicing were already implementing were already selling so theres quite a bit of an economic value or incentive for us to be able to sell and then from a paying or price the owner of the service bureau gets a lot of comfort that there isnt a huge disruption its a continuation of their legacy and they get a payment from somebody now thats very fair and very market value and then we could enjoy the synergies going forward and in many cases they can either have a job or not depending on what their exit strategy is so we have about  of those left as far as the overall ma marketplace were active in our pursuit to double the company and to continue to grow the company we have been active in the past and will continue to be active in the acquisition market and then organically we feel really good about the structure and the process of where were in and how we build the business going forward david hynes yes perfect and then i wanted to ask about the sales force a bit i mean you have those guys selling all the products now which is great i mean that increases the crosssell opportunity but is there any worry or risk of kind of elephant hunting now that they have all the products in their bag i mean how do you ensure that kind of the velocity of deals keeps up as the scope and size of the opportunity increases and im sure with new sales leadership thats a lot of the focus but maybe you could kind of give us your highlevel thoughts patrick goepel yes  no i appreciate the concern and the questions and eyal and i have spent a lot of time talking about this really  we really are pleased  we just upgraded the whole sales function in a big way from the previous management our thought process here is top down were going into accounts strategically as opposed to bottom up we almost had an activity focus instead of a strategic focus and now that were going strategically were getting in at the cfo the vp of it the ceo the vp of hr and what were doing is were selling a tops down roibased solution and were using our technology in the cases of facial recognition or sensor technology to really prove our thesis and prove results what thats done is put data on the front end of the cycle in a higher level than before and what thats led to so far is quicker sales cycles and bigger kind of sales deals so were very pleased with that progress we have a long way to go by no means are we done or could we stall were early in a journey but what i would say the results are very very encouraging and the pipelines are very encouraging and were hoping that the fact that were solutionoriented and roibased and selling top down will add velocity to the sales  the speed of the sales cycle because in the past we were more a featurefunction tactical in selling bottom up and as you know when you go bottom up youre kind of begging the cfo for an order as opposed to getting there buy an upfront and then getting the deal to execute so were cautiously optimistic and the first quarter results were pretty good david hynes great and then maybe if i could sneak one last one in for brad brad help us think about what we should see sequentially on the cloud line i know some payroll businesses have kind of onetime form filing revenues in q is there any of that and should we expect to see sequential growth in cloud revenues or how does it kind of  the linearity of it unfold over the balance of this year brad wolfe yes i think youre going to see  youre going to continue to see growth in cloud revenue i do think there is some seasonality which drives some of that in the first quarter but i dont think thats going to cause us to come down substantially going forward and as pat has said and i said in my remarks you look at the pipeline you look at the bookings you look at all the metrics all that volume is increasing so our expectation would be that cloud revenue would continue to increase and cloud revenue hopefully as a percentage of overall revenue will increase operator and our next question comes from the line of eric martinuzzi from lake street capital markets eric martinuzzi i was just curious to know  the backlog one of the things that you talk about is how thats going to be rolling out throughout the year but it was roughly flat i think it was up  yearonyear talk to me about  because i would have thought it would have been higher given the acquisitions patrick goepel yes thanks eric and  on the acquisitions the acquisitions in many cases are midmarket kind of payrolls that really arent as sophisticated as public company reporting so they start  i mean they kind of start on the same day if you will and theyre selling in many cases the payroll services as we layer more services onto those acquisitions in the area of cobra time and labor management health and welfare space management you may see backlog go up in the second and third and fourth quarter as it relates to those acquisitions it did go  up yearoveryear weve been fortunate in some of our bigger deals over the last couple of years we were early in the space deals early on the sensor deals a lot of that backlog has worked itself through the system so even though sales are up pretty good our backlog was  sequential  yearoveryear so were working through some of that backlog i would say backlog now is at a place where now that pssi was installed morgan stanley was installed metlife has been installed weve had some  really big deals get installed and those were global deals we have some global in procter  gamble we anticipate a few wins in the second quarter that will be over a year but i would think backlog will go up maybe half as much as sales growth or so over time but in this quarter we worked through a lot of the backlog and especially the january  starts eric martinuzzi okay and then one more question for me on the gross margin obviously terrific expansion there  certainly a nice bump versus a year ago but you do have a consulting business now just wondering how we should think about where gross margin winds up finishing the year or maybe just if we could focus on q just so we have a sense of how the business has changed with the acquisitions and the increased cloud revenue as well brad wolfe yes i think  this is brad wolfe i think the gross margin  we talked about this before sort of that  to  even with the addition of pmsi we expect those numbers to hold we dont expect any significant lessening of the margins and certainly as we grow i think there is even some  opportunities for that to expand so i think youre going to see us end the year in that  to  range and on pmsi a portion of that revenue we would consider recurring because they have contracts that renew and so thats just renewed revenue for us so i dont think its going to  youre going to see pretty much what youve seen in the past operator and our next question comes from the line of mike latimore from northland capital michael latimore i guess pat do you still think you could see some organic growth rate improvements sort of throughout the year just so indiscernible patrick goepel absolutely i think last year we entered the year about  organic this quarter there is some noise in the numbers with the  acquisitions and the mangrove partial but i think if you take the noise out and some of the double count revenue of service bureaus we probably grew about  or  i still think organically well probably be in that   improvement per quarter or so so the goal would be  organic layeron acquisitions and  ebitda and well continue to drive that formula for success michael latimore okay and the huge growth in the pipeline again this quarter just want to clarify thats mainly  youre seeing mainly crosssell opportunities with your broader product portfolio and its mainly cloud patrick goepel it exactly  its exactly that and what it is is when were leading with a roibased strategy a bigger sales cycle more products to the solution we were able to get bigger opportunities now we got to close those opportunities its still relatively new for us so while were excited about the pipeline and excited about the opportunities and excited about the early results we still have ways to go but we think we have the right leadership the right secret sauce if you will and the right aggressiveness in the marketplace to continue to work through and get the results michael latimore great and just last question you mentioned some big space fields in the pipeline i guess can you just provide a little more color around that other than having great products for that vertical whats sort of the catalyst with the customer to be making these decisions is it tied to lowering of real estate cost is it initiatives around nextgen work environments what do you see as kind of driving those individuals patrick goepel yes  no mike i appreciate that i think theres really  one is the ability to track top talent hr people today and especially in some of the bigger cities lets say in london singapore new york chicago san francisco wherever  geneva what theyre looking is they want to track top talent top talent doesnt always want to go in the office every day and what they want to do is have a flexible workspace so to attract that top talent many times hr people are looking for how do i attract top talent how do i get a responsible accountable worklife balance and how do i get a work from home and a work from office strategy i  and thats perhaps the toughest question that hr people face because many of them have gotten it wrong by doing it too decentralized or not having people come on in the office enough and yet some people have gotten it wrong by forcing everybody in the office every day so theyre working through that issue meanwhile the cfo is taking numbers and saying wow if i can go to a  employee to desk ratio i can save  in many cases to the bottom line and thats a very attractive cost offering and then three the millennials are voting with their feet and voting where they work and if theyre not getting what they want they go somewhere else then unemployment being at  they have some power right now so i think its a combination of those  things what i would say is our activity is very high in some of these areas and we anticipate selling some figure deals here over the second and third quarter and we feel good about our solution in that area operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of ryan macdonald with wunderlich securities ryan macdonald really i guess starting on sort of looking at the income statement here when you  can you talk about with an expectation of gross margin sort of staying in that  to  range moving forward can you talk about what sort of expectations are for sga it seems like it was a bit higher than we initially expected in the first quarter and is this something that we should expect as being a high watermark for the remainder of the year patrick goepel yes welcome ryan and thank you for the question what i would say on the sga first quarter expenses we did have  we closed  deals as well as theres a lot of training a lot of how we do business we were changing especially in the front end of the business we have our customer conference in the second quarter that were working towards and getting people so  and then  and in the first quarter we pay employer taxes and a number of different things that we dont smooth out through the year so we take the burden of some of the taxes upfront et cetera we also have a few tuckin acquisitions that were looking at so weve had a busy quarter and a fruitful quarter but costs were a little bit up but brad as far as operating expenses brad wolfe yes  no im just going to echo what pat said i think the first quarter traditionally has been and will continue to be our weakest quarter in terms of bottom line ebitda but if you look at that yearoveryear there is a substantial improvement there is leverage as we get volume to run through the system also were reinvesting back into growth i mean were a growth company now so while we want to keep  i think pat said  organic and  ebitda i think if we ran this company just to maximize ebitda over time we could get that margin up substantially but we plan to invest back into primarily i think sales and marketing and product so thats driving some of it the other factor is pat has said were going to be active in the ma market so there are some cost to going out and hunting for deals and things like that but if you take  strip out all that stuff and you look at it operating expenses are actually better yearoveryear than they were last year so i think things are going very well in that regard ryan macdonald got it and then just quick followup weve got the  sort of the new accounting standards with asu  coming out and being sort of an impending i guess issue that a lot more software are having to tackle and while i realize that asure is obviously focused on moving more to the cloud as a percent of the total revenues and had success there can you talk about sort of  if youre expecting to see sort of any impact from that materially related to the onpremise and license business and does this impact or affect the way you look at your strategy moving forward between the balance of sort of onpremise versus the cloud brad wolfe thats a great question weve been talking with our auditors i dont know since midlast year since this first came out we just hired a new controller to come in who has  experience so hes very familiar with the methodology in that regard based on those conversations we dont expect this to drive strategy we dont expect this to drive any meaningful changes but were working through it right now we will have to go back and restate for comparability purposes and its high in our radar and in fact we had an audit committee meeting a couple of days ago and every audit committee we talk about this particular topic but i dont expect thats going to drive strategy or any change in what we  what were doing strategically today patrick goepel and that brad will go in effect probably for asure in  right brad wolfe correct but well have to restate to be able to do comparability for prior years so were working on it and i think as it becomes more  theres more clarity we can give the investor community and investors insights into it but i dont expect it to drive strategy or any meaningful change in the economics for asure patrick goepel i think thats all the questions that we have today so i think in summary the big takeaway asure is making nice progress the organic engine is  we feel really good about  we feel good about the change in methodology around sales we think that there is operational leverage were going to continue on a hunt for acquisitions we like the tuckin acquisitions that especially are already on our technology that model works very nicely were pursuing the shorttointermediate goal of  million we believe were in an oligopoly kind of marketplace where you have some big companies and then you have a lot of small companies and nobody in the middle and were going to stake that ground where were going to get to be a midcap company et cetera and continue to grow through that were going to do that both organically and with acquisition and we feel that there is a need for our services were going to delight our clients our metrics are very sound and were really excited to be in this position and look forward to future quarterly calls thanks for your time operator ladies and gentlemen thank you
