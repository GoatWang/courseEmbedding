he was our technical liason our collaborator and our guide his knowledge of the industry and the technology associated with it made our experience simple and painless and provided a great insight into our audience years later our paths crossed again during my time at the international film festival summit where chris returned as a conference sponsor and marketing partner he was tireless in his
