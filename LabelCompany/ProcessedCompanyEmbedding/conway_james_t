that point to locate weapons of mass destruction in iraq he replied in part it was a surprise to me then it remains a surprise to me now that we have not uncovered weapons its not for lack of trying weve been to virtually every ammunition supply point between the kuwaiti border and baghdad but theyre simply not there what the regime was intending to do in terms of its use of the weapons we thought we understood—or we certainly had our best guess our most dangerous our most likely courses of action that the intelligence folks were giving us we were simply wrong but whether or not were wrong at the national level i think still very much remains to be seencitation needed conway is sworn in by general peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff on november   us marines of the st
