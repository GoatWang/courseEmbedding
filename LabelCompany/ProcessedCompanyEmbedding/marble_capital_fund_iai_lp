funds are shorting october   by matthew mcalister share tweet share  share hedge funds manager analysis manager monday roystone capital management karan katyal senior analytics associate todays manager monday takes a look at a roystone capital management which has had a hard time generating alpha in the current environment thus far our manager mondays have tended to focus on popular funds that have no trouble generating alpha today we’ll examine a manager that public data indicates has had a slightly more difficult go of it albeit over a much shorter time period in a low dispersion environment roystone capital management is a valueoriented hedge fund founded in  by rich barrera formerly of redwood and glenview the fund invests both long and short in equities and credit all the below analysis is purely on their long equity book they’re required to publicly file so does not encapsulate their entire book given the asset class profile of roystone’s investments and the fact they did not reach sufficient size to file till q  this is an important disclaimer this analysis does not include their first year and the multiasset class longshort nature of their portfolio means actual performance and portfolio composition may differ greatly asset growth  transmission roystone has grown explosively aum as measured by market value has roughly doubled from where it was in the first filing in q  as we’ve pointed out a few times in the past an increase in assets is typically reflected in an equity fund’s portfolio through three metrics an increase in the number of securities as the manager tries to find new names to deploy the capital a rise up the market cap spectrum as the manager searches for names big enough to be able to accept the additional money andor a decrease in liquidity as the manager decides to double down on the same names when we inspect roystone’s portfolio we first see that the number of securities they’ve publicly filed on has stayed roughly stable with some ups and downs meanwhile d liquidity has actually increased given this one would posit that roystone has likely pushed the third lever to accommodate asset growth – and sure enough examination of their portfolio shows that on a weighted average basis the fund has crept up the market cap spectrum later we will explore whether this shift has been a good thing absolute and relative analysis on an absolute basis roystone seems to have done a decent job generating nearly bps of contribution of the  names they’ve filed on since q  they’ve made money on  of their names what we here at novus refer to as a batting average and have deployed  of capital into these winnings these impressive metrics have been hamstrung slightly by the fact their average winner makes bps whereas their average loser detracts  bps this unimpressive winloss ratio of x suggests that roystone may have some issues around sizing up their winners and cutting their losers see this novus paper that goes into some more depth about the importance of the winloss ratio more worries come up when we look at roystone’s performance on a relative basis comparing each security to the market and to its relevant sector benchmark we can dissect how much of the fund’s contribution from that security has come from exposure to the marketsector “beta” and how much has come from security selectiontrading “alpha” the results of this analysis across the portfolio can be seen below the data suggests that the entirety of the bps that roystone has generated on its long equity book has come from beta security selectiontrading detracted bps while this obviously isn’t great there is an interesting observation one can make upon examining the biggest alpha generatorsdetractors with the exception of valeant on the long side and media general on the short side none of these names are particularly popular amongst hedge funds indeed when we examine the novus top  the  most popular names among hedge funds our research has found we find just  overlap with roystone’s book what this means is for better or for worse roystone unlike numerous other funds is not collecting  and  to go to “idea lunches” and schmooze stock picks off the competition sector analysis since their first filing the fund has been focused on three main sectors consumer discretionary healthcare and tech more recently they have increased exposure slightly to industrials and utilities and have exited the financials space entirely as we dig in further we see that the book has generated alpha primarily in healthcare positive performance in other segments has largely been driven by marketsector exposure worryingly significant alpha has been detracted in the core consumer discretionary and tech sectors in the chart below the lighter bars are beta and the darker bars are alpha additionally despite relatively small allocations utilities and materials have been the heaviest detractors with the lack of success in their core sectors the manager can’t be blamed for exploring other options but these do not seem to be working out market cap analysis as we previously noted the avenue that roystone has appeared to have gone down to incorporate asset growth is a move into larger market capitalization names often this can be a sign that a manager’s style is drifting into an area in which they don’t have expertise let’s see if that’s the case here as expected mega and large cap exposure have risen since late  at the expense of mid and small cap exposure fortunately it appears that this move up the market cap spectrum has been additive to the portfolio substantively all alpha has been generated by large and mega cap names position sizing position sizing is another way for a manager to generate alpha getting one name in ten right is fine if  of your money is in that winning name splitting roystone’s book into various position sizing buckets we can examine the returns they generated across the buckets what the chart above is showing is had they deployed  of their capital into names in the bps bucket roystone would have annualized at  this points to an underlying issue with conviction the right securities are being picked but are not being sized up final thoughts in previous manager mondays public data has shown managers to be rock stars while the data does not show roystone in equally favorable light all this analysis needs to be taken with a grain of salt – their shorts along with their credit positions may have performed very differently to the names we examined additionally the time period in question is probably not statistically significant especially given the low dispersion environment that has made it difficult for most managers to generate alpha finally there are a few positives to be taken their relatively unique portfolio along with a move up the market capitalization spectrum into names where they’ve been able to generate more alpha activist vs activist vs activist one of the most polarizing strategies a hedge fund manager can employ is to be an activist investor carl icahn the largest and most renowned of activists recently weighed in on the issue stating “there are bad activists and we agree that it’s bad all they want to do is get in and rock the boat and make a quick trade” but we have found that data speaks favorably of activist managers or at the very least the returns they are able to generate for their investors without opining on the “good” or “bad” it’s clear that activists can be very different in the strategies they use to create value for the companies they target and their investors this article performs a deepdive holdings analysis on three prominent activist hedge fund managers who’s in the report novus’ exclusive activist

making better investment decisions may   by stan altshuller share tweet share  share healthcare sector hedge funds how hedge funds are making billions in healthcare stan altshuller chief research officer hedge funds have made billions by investing heavily in healthcare we use our platform to break down manager investments and biggest wins healthcare stocks have been on a tear recently and have nearly doubled on average from january  through march  the date range for this analysis looking at the performance of the sp by industry healthcare is the highestperforming sector by a wide margin trouncing it consumer discretionary industrials and the dividendrich utilities sectors buoyed by the affordable care act aging baby boomers as well as increased global demand for medical devices the sector shows no signs of cooling cumulative return of the sp  by sector january  – march  hedge funds increase exposure this outperformance has not gone unnoticed by the hedge fund industry while the index weighting of healthcare grew due to the recent outperformance hedge funds have moved aggressively into the sector consider this in  hedge funds were underweight the sector relative to sp  by almost  but recently they have moved their dollars to healthcare and are currently overweight the sector here is their relative weight through time as tracked by the novus alpha platform relative weight of hedge funds to the healthcare sector january  – march  what this means for hedge fund investors given the increased importance of the healthcare sector to hedge funds the question that every investor should now be asking is whether hedge fund managers actually pick stocks that outperform the broad healthcare index or are they simply chasing a different flavor of beta the answer surprised even us they are chasing some beta but they are generating tons of alpha in the sector as well let me briefly explain how we got there first we took every hedge fund manager that files with the sec and constructed a comingled valueweighted portfolio of all hedge funds we call that the hedge fund universe hfu and it currently tracks over t in long market value next we ran our own attribution framework called novus framework on that portfolio speaking simply novus framework allows us to decompose returns and understand the portion of returns attributable to market volatility versus picking stocks below you can see the results so let’s digest them the sector contributed bps of cumulative return since jan  right most column in the below table of that bps were simply a result of market movement and  was due to being in the healthcare sector but an extra bps was generated by hedge funds picking the right stocks within the healthcare sector this number is the largest of all sectors so while there was beta to be had for sure hedge funds did their jobs and picked stocks that also generated alpha that has made the sector a godsend for hedge funds in the recent years novus framework on hedge fund universe by sector january  – march  novus framework on hedge fund universe by sector security selection and sector effect only january  – march  greatest wins in healthcare over the period analyzed hedge fund managers invested in  unique healthcare stocks  of which were profitable more importantly the average contributor made managers bps while the average detractor cost only bps – a great risk reward ratio the biggest contributors were valeant allergan and actavis followed by gilead and thermo fisher digging deeper if you assume that all hedge funds generate the same amount of alpha in the healthcare sector – you would of course be mistaken while on average hedge funds picked outperforming stocks many funds detracted value looking at just the ones that have managed to outperform we constructed a list of the top healthcare stock pickers among hedge funds from  these managers have been exceptional at picking the right stocks within healthcare see if some of your funds have made the list name  hc  contribution from selection in hc  –  great point partners llc   ra capital management llc   baker brothers advisors llc   palo alto investors llc   broadwood
