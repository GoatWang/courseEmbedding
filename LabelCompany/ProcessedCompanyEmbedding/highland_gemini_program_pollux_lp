nasa gemini missions this website is funded by your donations about earthly issues contact site map president trump  nasa gemini missions the national aeronautics and space administration announced december   a plan to extend the existing manned space flight program by development of a twoman spacecraft the program was officially designated gemini on january   it was named after the third constellation of the zodiac featuring the twin stars castor and pollux the program was operationally completed with the gemini xii flight the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini v the manned spacecraft center gemini effort was headed by dr robert r gilruth director of the center and charles w matthews gemini program manager  program objectives  the gemini program was conceived after it became evident to nasa officials that an intermediate step was required between project mercury and the apollo program the major objectives assigned to gemini were to subject two men and supporting equipment to long duration flights  a requirement for projected later trips to the moon or deeper space to effect rendezvous and docking with other orbiting vehicles and to maneuver the docked vehicles in space using the propulsion system of the target vehicle for such maneuvers to perfect methods of reentry and landing the spacecraft at a preselected landlanding point to gain additional information concerning the effects of weightlessness on crew members and to record the physiological reactions of crew members during long duration flights a brief summary of the gemini flight results reveals how successful the gemini program was all of the major objectives were met as well as many other objectives assigned to each mission with the exception of land landing which was canceled from the gemini program in  however the precision control necessary to achieve the land landing objective was demonstrated gemini goals the second us manned space program was announced in january  its twoman crew gave it its name gemini for the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux gemini involved  flights including two unmanned flight tests of the equipment like mercurys its major objectives were clearcut to subject man and equipment to space flight up to two weeks in duration to rendezvous and dock with orbiting vehicles and to maneuver the docked combination by using the target vehicles propulsion system to perfect methods of entering the atmosphere and landing at a preselected point on land its goals were also met with the exception of a land landing which was cancelled in    the spacecraft  the spacecraft was an enlargement of the familiar mercury capsulem  ft long m  ft in diameter and about  kilograms  pounds in weight engineering changes simplified maintenance and made it more maneuverable for the pilots the titan ii rocket more powerful than the redstone placed the larger spacecraft into orbit sometimes referred to as geminititan for the craft and its launch vehicle each flight was designated by a roman numeral only the first capsule was nicknamed command pilot virgil grissom called it the molly brown in reference to his mercury spacecraft

between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in  and concluded in  the gemini spacecraft carried a twoastronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions between  and  putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union geminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extravehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations all gemini flights were launched from launch complex  lc at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the gemini–titan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbmnote  gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight controlnote  the astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the  astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini  this mission was performed by the backup crew the only time that had happened in nasas history to date gemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late  he believed gemini could perform lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in  mcdonnelldouglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to  astronauts to the planned space stations in the apollo

external links program origins and objectivesedit after the existing apollo program was chartered by president john f kennedy on may   to land men on the moon it became evident to nasa officials that a followon to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo specifically jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo in february  he presented two initial versions of gemini at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march  scale models of mercury mark ii were shown in july  at mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis nasa approved project gemini on december   the mcdonnell corporation was contracted to build it on december   when it was publicly announced on january   it was formally rechristened project gemini gemini in latin means twins or double which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux the major objectives were to demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a moon landing to a maximum of two weeks to effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle to demonstrate extravehicular activity eva or spacewalks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there to perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a preselected location on landnote  teamedit the twocrew member carrying gemini capsule was designed by a canadian jim chamberlin he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with  senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the us space task group’s engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule astronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft the other mercury astronauts dubbed the gemini spacecraft the gusmobile grissom writes in his posthumous  book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini a guenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad closeout procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a goodhumored rapport with him spacecraftedit a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraft nasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in  to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in  the spacecraft was  feet  inches  m long and  feet  m wide with a launch weight varying from  to  pounds  to  kg the gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components reentry moduleedit many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solidstate electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair geminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solidfuel rocket but instead used aircraftstyle ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle the main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats maxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand lessthanenthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about  seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach  speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected inflight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape gemini was the first astronautcarrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft onboard computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed  pounds  kg its core memory had  addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables all numeric data was bit twoscomplement integers sometimes used as fixedpoint numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a bit opcode and  bits of operand could go in any syllable unlike mercury the gemini used inflight radar and an artificial horizon—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august  the original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule adapter moduleedit the adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module retro moduleedit the retro module contained four solidfuel tem stare retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center reentry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during liftoff would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket equipment moduleedit gemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forwardbackward leftright updown in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes early shortduration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft gemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighterlike features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capabilitynote  the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program launch vehicleedit main article titan ii glv the titan ii had debuted in  as the air forces secondgeneration icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygenrp however the titan had considerable difficulty being manrated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy astronautsedit astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini  spacecraft  gemini  prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast  deke slayton as director of flight crew operations had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the gemini program each flight had a primary crew and backup crew and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the mercury seven alan shepard grissom cooper and schirra john glenn had retired from nasa in january  and scott carpenter who was blamed by some in nasa management for the problematic reentry of aurora  was on leave to participate in the navys sealab project and was grounded from flight in july  due to an arm injury sustained in a motorbike accident slayton himself continued to be grounded due to a heart problem titles used for the lefthand command and righthand seat crew positions were taken from the us air force pilot ratings command pilot and pilot sixteen astronauts flew on

gemini  and schirra and young for gemini  which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini  was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini  to be the first longduration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini  delays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini  and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their longduration mission assigned to gemini  the second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed ménières disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini  slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the longduration gemini  again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini  to pilot of gemini  and borman to backup command of gemini  finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini  the third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini  he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini  and put scott as pilot of gemini  and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini  the fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini  capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the redesignated gemini a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini  to be the backup crew of gemini  this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini  along with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo  this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon missionsedit gemini mission

by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program edward h white became the first american to make an extravehicular activity eva or space walk on june   during gemini  gemini  demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power gemini a and  accomplished the first space rendezvous in december  and gemini  set a day endurance record gemini  achieved the first space docking with an unmanned agena target vehicle gemini  set a manned earth orbital altitude record of  nautical miles  km in september  using the propulsion system of its agena target vehicle this record still stands as of  edwin buzz aldrin on gemini  became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without lifethreatening exhaustion rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts edward white during spacewalk gemini  june  rendezvous of gemini  and  december  first docking

gemini mcdonnell aircraft the main contractor for mercury and gemini was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used offtheshelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing big geminiedit main article big gemini big gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august  it was intended to provide largecapacity allpurpose access to space including missions that ultimately used apollo or the space shuttle the study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station landlanding at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements two baseline spacecraft were defined a nineman minimum modification version of the gemini b called minmod big g and a man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new stateoftheart subsystems called advanced big gcitation needed three launch vehiclessaturn ib titan iiim and saturn int sicsivb were investigated for use with the spacecraft military applicationsedit the air force had an interest in the gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini  spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice the usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini at first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in  by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments mol was canceled by secretary of defense melvin laird in  when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more costeffectively in mediaedit two gemini capsules codenamed jupiter are featured in the plot of the  james

nasas second human spaceflight program conducted between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in  and concluded in  the gemini spacecraft carried a twoastronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions between  and  putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union geminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extravehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations all gemini flights were launched from launch complex  lc at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the gemini–titan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbmnote  gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight controlnote  the astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the  astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini  this mission was performed by the backup crew the only time that had happened in nasas history to date gemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late  he believed gemini could perform lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in  mcdonnelldouglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to  astronauts

references  notes  citations  books  articles  external links program origins and objectivesedit after the existing apollo program was chartered by president john f kennedy on may   to land men on the moon it became evident to nasa officials that a followon to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo specifically jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo in february  he presented two initial versions of gemini at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march  scale models of mercury mark ii were shown in july  at mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis nasa approved project gemini on december   the mcdonnell corporation was contracted to build it on december   when it was publicly announced on january   it was formally rechristened project gemini gemini in latin means twins or double which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux the major objectives were to demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a moon landing to a maximum of two weeks to effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle to demonstrate extravehicular activity eva or spacewalks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there to perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a preselected location on landnote  teamedit the twocrew member carrying gemini capsule was designed by a canadian jim chamberlin he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with  senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the us space task group’s engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule astronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft the other mercury astronauts dubbed the gemini spacecraft the gusmobile grissom writes in his posthumous  book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini a guenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad closeout procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a goodhumored rapport with him spacecraftedit a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraft nasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in  to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in  the spacecraft was  feet  inches  m long and  feet  m wide with a launch weight varying from  to  pounds  to  kg the gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components reentry moduleedit many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solidstate electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair geminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solidfuel rocket but instead used aircraftstyle ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle the main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats maxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand lessthanenthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about  seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach  speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected inflight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape gemini was the first astronautcarrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft onboard computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed  pounds  kg its core memory had  addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables all numeric data was bit twoscomplement integers sometimes used as fixedpoint numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a bit opcode and  bits of operand could go in any syllable unlike mercury the gemini used inflight radar and an artificial horizon—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august  the original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule adapter moduleedit the adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module retro moduleedit the retro module contained four solidfuel tem stare retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center reentry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during liftoff would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket equipment moduleedit gemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forwardbackward leftright updown in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes early shortduration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft gemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighterlike features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capabilitynote  the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program launch vehicleedit main article titan ii glv the titan ii had debuted in  as the air forces secondgeneration icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygenrp however the titan had considerable difficulty being manrated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy astronautsedit astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini  spacecraft  gemini  prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast  deke slayton as director of flight crew operations had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the gemini program each flight had a primary crew and backup crew and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the mercury seven alan shepard grissom cooper and schirra john glenn had retired from nasa in january  and scott carpenter who was blamed by some in nasa management for the problematic reentry of aurora  was on leave to participate in the navys sealab project and was grounded from flight in july  due to an arm injury sustained in a motorbike accident slayton himself continued to be grounded due to a heart problem titles used for the lefthand command and righthand seat crew positions were

selectionedit in late  slayton selected shepard and stafford for gemini  mcdivitt and white for gemini  and schirra and young for gemini  which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini  was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini  to be the first longduration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini  delays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini  and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their longduration mission assigned to gemini  the second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed ménières disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini  slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the longduration gemini  again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini  to pilot of gemini  and borman to backup command of gemini  finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini  the third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini  he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini  and put scott as pilot of gemini  and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini  the fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini  capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the redesignated gemini a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini  to be the backup crew of gemini  this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini  along with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo  this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon missionsedit gemini mission control in houston during gemini  in  and  two gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield these were followed by ten flights with crews in  and  all were launched by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program edward h white became the first american to make an extravehicular activity eva or space walk on june   during gemini  gemini  demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power gemini a and  accomplished the first space rendezvous in december  and gemini  set a day endurance record gemini  achieved the first space docking with an unmanned agena target vehicle gemini  set a manned earth orbital altitude record of  nautical miles  km in september  using the propulsion system of its agena target vehicle this record still stands as of  edwin buzz aldrin on gemini  became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without lifethreatening exhaustion rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts edward

alameda california proposed extensions and applicationsedit advanced geminiedit main article advanced gemini mcdonnell aircraft the main contractor for mercury and gemini was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used offtheshelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing big geminiedit main article big gemini big gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august  it was intended to provide largecapacity allpurpose access to space including missions that ultimately used apollo or the space shuttle the study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station landlanding at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements two baseline spacecraft were defined a nineman minimum modification version of the gemini b called minmod big g and a man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new stateoftheart subsystems called advanced big gcitation needed three launch vehiclessaturn ib titan iiim and saturn int sicsivb were investigated for use with the spacecraft military applicationsedit the air force had an interest in the gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini  spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice the usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini at first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in  by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments mol was canceled by secretary of defense melvin laird in  when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more costeffectively in

nasas second human spaceflight program conducted between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in  and concluded in  the gemini spacecraft carried a twoastronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions between  and  putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union geminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extravehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations all gemini flights were launched from launch complex  lc at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the gemini–titan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbmnote  gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight controlnote  the astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the  astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini  this mission was performed by the backup crew the only time that had happened in nasas history to date gemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late  he believed gemini could perform lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in  mcdonnelldouglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to  astronauts

moon it became evident to nasa officials that a followon to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo specifically jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo in february  he presented two initial versions of gemini at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march  scale models of mercury mark ii were shown in july  at mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis nasa approved project gemini on december   the mcdonnell corporation was contracted to build it on december   when it was publicly announced on january   it was formally rechristened project gemini gemini in latin means twins or double which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux the major objectives were to demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a moon landing to a maximum of two weeks to effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle to demonstrate extravehicular activity eva or spacewalks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there to perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a preselected location on landnote  teamedit the twocrew member carrying gemini capsule was designed by a canadian jim chamberlin he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with  senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the us space task group’s engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule astronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft the other mercury astronauts dubbed the gemini spacecraft the gusmobile grissom writes in his posthumous  book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini a guenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad closeout procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a goodhumored rapport with him spacecraftedit a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraft nasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in  to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in  the spacecraft was  feet  inches  m long and  feet  m wide with a launch weight varying from  to  pounds  to  kg the gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components reentry moduleedit many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solidstate electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair geminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solidfuel rocket but instead used aircraftstyle ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle the main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats maxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand lessthanenthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about  seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach  speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected inflight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape gemini was the first astronautcarrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft onboard computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed  pounds  kg its core memory had  addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables all numeric data was bit twoscomplement integers sometimes used as fixedpoint numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a bit opcode and  bits of operand could go in any syllable unlike mercury the gemini used inflight radar and an artificial horizon—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august  the original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule adapter moduleedit the adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module retro moduleedit the retro module contained four solidfuel tem stare retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center reentry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during liftoff would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket equipment moduleedit gemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forwardbackward leftright updown in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes early shortduration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft gemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighterlike features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capabilitynote  the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program launch vehicleedit main article titan ii glv the titan ii had debuted in  as the air forces secondgeneration icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygenrp however the titan had considerable difficulty being manrated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy astronautsedit astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini  spacecraft  gemini  prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast  deke slayton as director of flight crew operations had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the gemini program each flight had a primary crew and backup crew and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the mercury seven alan shepard grissom cooper and schirra john glenn had retired from nasa in january  and scott carpenter who was blamed by some in nasa management for the problematic reentry of aurora  was on leave to participate in the navys sealab project and was grounded from flight in

selectionedit in late  slayton selected shepard and stafford for gemini  mcdivitt and white for gemini  and schirra and young for gemini  which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini  was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini  to be the first longduration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini  delays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini  and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their longduration mission assigned to gemini  the second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed ménières disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini  slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the longduration gemini  again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini  to pilot of gemini  and borman to backup command of gemini  finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini  the third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini  he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini  and put scott as pilot of gemini  and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini  the fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini  capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the redesignated gemini a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini  to be the backup crew of gemini  this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini  along with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo  this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon missionsedit gemini mission control in houston during gemini  in  and  two gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield these were followed by ten flights with crews in  and  all were launched by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program edward h white became the first american to make an extravehicular activity eva or space walk on june   during gemini  gemini  demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power gemini a and  accomplished the first space rendezvous in december  and gemini  set a day endurance record gemini  achieved the first space docking with an unmanned agena target vehicle gemini  set a manned earth orbital altitude record of  nautical miles  km in september  using the propulsion system of its agena target vehicle this record still stands as of  edwin buzz aldrin on gemini  became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without lifethreatening exhaustion rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts edward

bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used offtheshelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing big geminiedit main article big gemini big gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august  it was intended to provide largecapacity allpurpose access to space including missions that ultimately used apollo or the space shuttle the study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station landlanding at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements two baseline spacecraft were defined a nineman minimum modification version of the gemini b called minmod big g and a man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new stateoftheart subsystems called advanced big gcitation needed three launch vehiclessaturn ib titan iiim and saturn int sicsivb were investigated for use with the spacecraft military applicationsedit the air force had an interest in the gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini  spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice the usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini at first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in  by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments mol was canceled by secretary of defense melvin laird in  when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more costeffectively in

nasas second human spaceflight program conducted between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in  and concluded in  the gemini spacecraft carried a twoastronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions between  and  putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union geminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extravehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations all gemini flights were launched from launch complex  lc at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the gemini–titan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbmnote  gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight controlnote  the astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the  astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini  this mission was performed by the backup crew the only time that had happened in nasas history to date gemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late  he believed gemini could perform lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in  mcdonnelldouglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to  astronauts

references  notes  citations  books  articles  external links program origins and objectivesedit after the existing apollo program was chartered by president john f kennedy on may   to land men on the moon it became evident to nasa officials that a followon to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo specifically jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo in february  he presented two initial versions of gemini at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march  scale models of mercury mark ii were shown in july  at mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis nasa approved project gemini on december   the mcdonnell corporation was contracted to build it on december   when it was publicly announced on january   it was formally rechristened project gemini gemini in latin means twins or double which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux the major objectives were to demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a moon landing to a maximum of two weeks to effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle to demonstrate extravehicular activity eva or spacewalks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there to perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a preselected location on landnote  teamedit the twocrew member carrying gemini capsule was designed by a canadian jim chamberlin he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with  senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the us space task group’s engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule astronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft the other mercury astronauts dubbed the gemini spacecraft the gusmobile grissom writes in his posthumous  book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini a guenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad closeout procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a goodhumored rapport with him spacecraftedit a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraft nasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in  to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in  the spacecraft was  feet  inches  m long and  feet  m wide with a launch weight varying from  to  pounds  to  kg the gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components reentry moduleedit many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solidstate electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair geminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solidfuel rocket but instead used aircraftstyle ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle the main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats maxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand lessthanenthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about  seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach  speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected inflight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape gemini was the first astronautcarrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft onboard computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed  pounds  kg its core memory had  addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables all numeric data was bit twoscomplement integers sometimes used as fixedpoint numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a bit opcode and  bits of operand could go in any syllable unlike mercury the gemini used inflight radar and an artificial horizon—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august  the original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule adapter moduleedit the adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module retro moduleedit the retro module contained four solidfuel tem stare retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center reentry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during liftoff would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket equipment moduleedit gemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forwardbackward leftright updown in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes early shortduration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft gemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighterlike features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capabilitynote  the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program launch vehicleedit main article titan ii glv the titan ii had debuted in  as the air forces secondgeneration icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygenrp however the titan had considerable difficulty being manrated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy astronautsedit astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini  spacecraft  gemini  prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast  deke slayton as director of flight crew operations had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the gemini program each flight had a primary crew and backup crew and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the mercury seven alan shepard grissom cooper and schirra john glenn had retired from nasa in january  and scott carpenter who was blamed by some in nasa management for the problematic reentry of aurora  was on leave to participate in the navys sealab project and was grounded from flight in

selectionedit in late  slayton selected shepard and stafford for gemini  mcdivitt and white for gemini  and schirra and young for gemini  which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini  was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini  to be the first longduration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini  delays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini  and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their longduration mission assigned to gemini  the second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed ménières disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini  slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the longduration gemini  again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini  to pilot of gemini  and borman to backup command of gemini  finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini  the third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini  he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini  and put scott as pilot of gemini  and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini  the fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini  capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the redesignated gemini a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini  to be the backup crew of gemini  this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini  along with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo  this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon missionsedit gemini mission control in houston during gemini  in  and  two gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield these were followed by ten flights with crews in  and  all were launched by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program edward h white became the first american to make an extravehicular activity eva or space walk on june   during gemini  gemini  demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power gemini a and  accomplished the first space rendezvous in december  and gemini  set a day endurance record gemini  achieved the first space docking with an unmanned agena target vehicle gemini  set a manned earth orbital altitude record of  nautical miles  km in september  using the propulsion system of its agena target vehicle this record still stands as of  edwin buzz aldrin on gemini  became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without lifethreatening exhaustion rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts edward

bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used offtheshelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing big geminiedit main article big gemini big gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august  it was intended to provide largecapacity allpurpose access to space including missions that ultimately used apollo or the space shuttle the study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station landlanding at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements two baseline spacecraft were defined a nineman minimum modification version of the gemini b called minmod big g and a man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new stateoftheart subsystems called advanced big gcitation needed three launch vehiclessaturn ib titan iiim and saturn int sicsivb were investigated for use with the spacecraft military applicationsedit the air force had an interest in the gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini  spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice the usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini at first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in  by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments mol was canceled by secretary of defense melvin laird in  when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more costeffectively in

nasas second human spaceflight program conducted between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in  and concluded in  the gemini spacecraft carried a twoastronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions between  and  putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union geminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extravehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations all gemini flights were launched from launch complex  lc at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the gemini–titan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbmnote  gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight controlnote  the astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the  astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini  this mission was performed by the backup crew the only time that had happened in nasas history to date gemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late  he believed gemini could perform lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in  mcdonnelldouglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to  astronauts

references  notes  citations  books  articles  external links program origins and objectivesedit after the existing apollo program was chartered by president john f kennedy on may   to land men on the moon it became evident to nasa officials that a followon to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo specifically jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo in february  he presented two initial versions of gemini at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march  scale models of mercury mark ii were shown in july  at mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis nasa approved project gemini on december   the mcdonnell corporation was contracted to build it on december   when it was publicly announced on january   it was formally rechristened project gemini gemini in latin means twins or double which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux the major objectives were to demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a moon landing to a maximum of two weeks to effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle to demonstrate extravehicular activity eva or spacewalks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there to perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a preselected location on landnote  teamedit the twocrew member carrying gemini capsule was designed by a canadian jim chamberlin he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with  senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the us space task group’s engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule astronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft the other mercury astronauts dubbed the gemini spacecraft the gusmobile grissom writes in his posthumous  book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini a guenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad closeout procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a goodhumored rapport with him spacecraftedit a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraft nasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in  to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in  the spacecraft was  feet  inches  m long and  feet  m wide with a launch weight varying from  to  pounds  to  kg the gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components reentry moduleedit many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solidstate electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair geminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solidfuel rocket but instead used aircraftstyle ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle the main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats maxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand lessthanenthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about  seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach  speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected inflight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape gemini was the first astronautcarrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft onboard computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed  pounds  kg its core memory had  addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables all numeric data was bit twoscomplement integers sometimes used as fixedpoint numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a bit opcode and  bits of operand could go in any syllable unlike mercury the gemini used inflight radar and an artificial horizon—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august  the original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule adapter moduleedit the adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module retro moduleedit the retro module contained four solidfuel tem stare retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center reentry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during liftoff would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket equipment moduleedit gemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forwardbackward leftright updown in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes early shortduration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft gemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighterlike features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capabilitynote  the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program launch vehicleedit main article titan ii glv the titan ii had debuted in  as the air forces secondgeneration icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygenrp however the titan had considerable difficulty being manrated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy astronautsedit astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini  spacecraft  gemini  prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast  deke slayton as director of flight crew operations had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the gemini program each flight had a primary crew and backup crew and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the mercury seven alan shepard grissom cooper and schirra john glenn had retired from nasa in january  and scott carpenter who was blamed by some in nasa management for the problematic reentry of aurora  was on leave to participate in the navys sealab project and was grounded from flight in

selectionedit in late  slayton selected shepard and stafford for gemini  mcdivitt and white for gemini  and schirra and young for gemini  which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini  was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini  to be the first longduration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini  delays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini  and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their longduration mission assigned to gemini  the second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed ménières disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini  slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the longduration gemini  again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini  to pilot of gemini  and borman to backup command of gemini  finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini  the third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini  he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini  and put scott as pilot of gemini  and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini  the fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini  capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the redesignated gemini a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini  to be the backup crew of gemini  this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini  along with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo  this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon missionsedit gemini mission control in houston during gemini  in  and  two gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield these were followed by ten flights with crews in  and  all were launched by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program edward h white became the first american to make an extravehicular activity eva or space walk on june   during gemini  gemini  demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power gemini a and  accomplished the first space rendezvous in december  and gemini  set a day endurance record gemini  achieved the first space docking with an unmanned agena target vehicle gemini  set a manned earth orbital altitude record of  nautical miles  km in september  using the propulsion system of its agena target vehicle this record still stands as of  edwin buzz aldrin on gemini  became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without lifethreatening exhaustion rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts edward

alameda california proposed extensions and applicationsedit advanced geminiedit main article advanced gemini mcdonnell aircraft the main contractor for mercury and gemini was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used offtheshelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing big geminiedit main article big gemini big gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august  it was intended to provide largecapacity allpurpose access to space including missions that ultimately

for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini  spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice the usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini at first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in  by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments mol was canceled by secretary of defense melvin laird in  when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more costeffectively in

nasas second human spaceflight program conducted between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in  and concluded in  the gemini spacecraft carried a twoastronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions between  and  putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union geminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extravehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations all gemini flights were launched from launch complex  lc at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the gemini–titan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbmnote  gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight controlnote  the astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the  astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini  this mission was performed by the backup crew the only time that had happened in nasas history to date gemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late  he believed gemini could perform lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in  mcdonnelldouglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to  astronauts

references  notes  citations  books  articles  external links program origins and objectivesedit after the existing apollo program was chartered by president john f kennedy on may   to land men on the moon it became evident to nasa officials that a followon to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo specifically jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo in february  he presented two initial versions of gemini at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march  scale models of mercury mark ii were shown in july  at mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis nasa approved project gemini on december   the mcdonnell corporation was contracted to build it on december   when it was publicly announced on january   it was formally rechristened project gemini gemini in latin means twins or double which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux the major objectives were to demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a moon landing to a maximum of two weeks to effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle to demonstrate extravehicular activity eva or spacewalks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there to perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a preselected location on landnote  teamedit the twocrew member carrying gemini capsule was designed by a canadian jim chamberlin he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with  senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the us space task group’s engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule astronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft the other mercury astronauts dubbed the gemini spacecraft the gusmobile grissom writes in his posthumous  book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini a guenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad closeout procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a goodhumored rapport with him spacecraftedit a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraft nasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in  to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in  the spacecraft was  feet  inches  m long and  feet  m wide with a launch weight varying from  to  pounds  to  kg the gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components reentry moduleedit many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solidstate electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair geminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solidfuel rocket but instead used aircraftstyle ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle the main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats maxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand lessthanenthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about  seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach  speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected inflight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape gemini was the first astronautcarrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft onboard computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed  pounds  kg its core memory had  addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables all numeric data was bit twoscomplement integers sometimes used as fixedpoint numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a bit opcode and  bits of operand could go in any syllable unlike mercury the gemini used inflight radar and an artificial horizon—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august  the original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule adapter moduleedit the adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module retro moduleedit the retro module contained four solidfuel tem stare retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center reentry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during liftoff would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket equipment moduleedit gemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forwardbackward leftright updown in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes early shortduration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft gemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighterlike features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capabilitynote  the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program launch vehicleedit main article titan ii glv the titan ii had debuted in  as the air forces secondgeneration icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygenrp however the titan had considerable difficulty being manrated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy astronautsedit astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini  spacecraft  gemini  prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast  deke slayton as director of flight crew operations had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the gemini program each flight had a primary crew and backup crew and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the mercury seven alan shepard grissom cooper and schirra john glenn had retired from nasa in january  and scott carpenter who was blamed by some in nasa management for the problematic reentry of aurora  was on leave to participate in the navys sealab project and was grounded from flight in

selectionedit in late  slayton selected shepard and stafford for gemini  mcdivitt and white for gemini  and schirra and young for gemini  which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini  was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini  to be the first longduration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini  delays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini  and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their longduration mission assigned to gemini  the second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed ménières disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini  slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the longduration gemini  again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini  to pilot of gemini  and borman to backup command of gemini  finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini  the third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini  he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini  and put scott as pilot of gemini  and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini  the fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini  capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the redesignated gemini a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini  to be the backup crew of gemini  this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini  along with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo  this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon missionsedit gemini mission control in houston during gemini  in  and  two gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield these were followed by ten flights with crews in  and  all were launched by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program edward h white became the first american to make an extravehicular activity eva or space walk on june   during gemini  gemini  demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power gemini a and  accomplished the first space rendezvous in december  and gemini  set a day endurance record gemini  achieved the first space docking with an unmanned agena target vehicle gemini  set a manned earth orbital altitude record of  nautical miles  km in september  using the propulsion system of its agena target vehicle this record still stands as of  edwin buzz aldrin on gemini  became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without lifethreatening exhaustion rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts edward

vehicle had been adapted from the usaf atlas missile the geminititan ii rockets were assigned air force serial numbers which were painted in four places on each titan ii on opposite sides on each of the first and second stages usaf crews maintained launch complex  and prepared and launched all of the geminititan ii launch vehicles data and experience operating the titans was of value to both the us air force and nasa the usaf serial numbers assigned to the geminititan launch vehicles are given in the tables above fifteen titan iis were ordered in  so the serial is xxx but only xxx is painted on the titan ii the order for the last three of the  launch vehicles was canceled on july   and they were never built serial numbers were however assigned to them prospectively   glv   glv and   glv

alameda california proposed extensions and applicationsedit advanced geminiedit main article advanced gemini mcdonnell aircraft the main contractor for mercury and gemini was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used offtheshelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing big geminiedit main article big gemini big gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august  it was intended to provide largecapacity allpurpose access to space including missions that ultimately used apollo or the space shuttle the study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station landlanding at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements two baseline spacecraft were defined a nineman minimum modification version of the gemini b called minmod big g and a man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new stateoftheart subsystems called advanced big gcitation needed three launch vehiclessaturn ib titan iiim and saturn int sicsivb were investigated for use with the spacecraft military applicationsedit the air force had an interest in the gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini  spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice the usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini at first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in  by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments mol was canceled by secretary of defense melvin laird in  when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more costeffectively in

which used a titan iiic  gemini  used the mercury control center located at cape kennedy for flight control as the new center was still in a test status gemini  was the first to be guided from houston with mercury control as a backup from gemini  until today all flights are controlled from houston  the requirement for a touchdown on land using a paraglider was canceled in   during the ten manned

content michael k rulison professor of physics additional notes moon  mercury print pdf moon the moon has fascinated mankind throughout the ages by simply viewing with the naked eye one can discern two major types of terrain relatively bright highlands and darker plains by the middle of the th century galileo and other early astronomers made telescopic observations noting an almost endless overlapping of craters it has also been known for more than a century that the moon is less dense than the earth although a certain amount of information was ascertained about the moon before the space age this new era has revealed many secrets barely imaginable before that time current knowledge of the moon is greater than for any other solar system object except earth this lends to a greater understanding of geologic processes and further appreciation of the complexity of terrestrial planets the moon is  kilometers  miles distant from the earth its diameter is  kilometers  miles both the rotation of the moon and its revolution around earth takes  days  hours and  minutes this synchronous rotation is caused by an unsymmetrical distribution of mass in the moon which has allowed earth’s gravity to keep one lunar hemisphere permanently turned toward earth the above full disc of the moon was photographed by the apollo  crew during their transearth coast homeward following a successful lunar landing mission in december  mare seen on this photo include serentatis tranquillitatis nectaris foecunditatis and crisium this image shows earthrise over the moon’s limb above is what the lunar surface was thought to look like in the ’s now we know it looks like the above image taking from the apollo missions many people have also seen imaginary faces on the moon such as the man on the moon the lady on the moon and the bunny on the moon full moon a mosaic of many images from a small telescope people have traced an imaginary “man on the moon” from the position of two large maria others have seen the “lady on the moon” a portrait view with the crater copernicus forming a pendant on her neck lastly there is the ever popular “bunny on the moon” doing a backflip as all dancing rabbits do during a full moon this is a movie of lunar rotation taken from the clementine mission in  notice how the farside of the moon does not have the large smoothlooking maria that the nearside has   the most obvious feature on the moon is its many craters due to impacts by space debris onto the surface an apollo  astronaut stands near the rim of plum crater m or over  yards in diameter although earth has experienced many meteorite impacts throughout its history the action of wind and water quickly erases the resulting craters earthmoon system the earthmoon system forms one of the lowest ratios of primary to secondary diameters in the solar system the ratio of earth to lunar diameter is  to  for comparison the next lowest is saturn and its largest moon titan with a ratio of  to  the earthmoon system is special in this regard and has an impact on the evolution of life the moonearth mass ratio is  also unprecedented in the solar system the radius of the moon is  km with a mean distance from the earth of  km the average density of the moon is  gcm which is consistent with basaltic silicates and not consistent with a large iron fenickel ni core like the earth more on basalt at end of chapter the lunar surface is greytan with a low albedo of  more on albedo at end of chapter the combination of the moon’s lower mass and its smaller radius means that its surface gravity is  the earth’s surface gravity walking on the moonis much different from walking on the earth as is falling on the moon surface features the major surface features on the moon are craters highlands and maria craters highlands maria the minor features are  wrinkle ridges  scarps  domes  rilles craters the typical features to an impact crater are shown below craters range in size from microscopic to large basins of order ’s km see orientale basin below normal round craters are due to impacts from objects up to a couple thousand meters object larger asteroids will typically crack the crust and form impact basins erosion is slow on a world without an atmosphere and is caused by  slumping gravity  other craters  temperature changes  moonquakes the result is that young craters have sharp edges usually less than × years old and old craters are rounded smoother with ages of order a billion years old highlands the lighter colored heavily cratered regions are called the lunar highlands the bare chaotic terrain indicates that these regions are primordial and one would expect the oldest rocks in these regions mountains on the moon are not due to tectonic activity but rather are due to overlapping impact rims maria darkcolored regions which turn out to be smooth plains of basaltic lava the are the remnants of large impact events that cracked the crust and allowed the lava from the mantle to flow upward and erase early cratering note that the impacts must have occurred after the initial phase of cratering   all the maria are on the nearside of the moon none on the farside this is due to the fact that the nearside crust is thinner than the farside crust easier to penetrate by impacts the crust is thinner on the nearside due to tidal interaction with the earth during the formation epoch lunar soil the lunar soil is a fine grained cohesive sandgravel containing glass spheres impact ejecta igneous dust and coarse breccia cemented material from impacts soil from the maria are  to × years old soil from the highland is × years old from the early solar system the soil composition for the moon is similar to earth soil but with very different element ratios in particular the lunar soil is rich in refractory elements ie ones with high boiling points and low in volatile elements ie ones with low boiling points more on refractory and volatile elements at end of chapter the conclusion is that the moon was formed from hotter materials than the earth apollo lunar program the effort to put men on the moon was motivated by a patrioticpanicked reaction to the ussr launch of sputnik in  ie it was initially a political goal the early space program was unique in that it represented leadership from the highest levels of government on down with unprecedented support from congress while the motivation was political careful attention to the science goals were maintained those were to see if humankind could survive and operate outside the earth’s environment to see if it was technologically possible to plan construct and pilot a mission in space to study the geological properties of the moon and compare its history to the earth’s prior to actually retrieving lunar samples little was known about the geological history of the moon theories for this history were based on examination of various photographs of the lunar surface establish a platform in orbit or the moon for astronomical studies outside the interference of earth’s atmosphere the history of lunar exploration is one of excellent planning and strategy on the part of nasa the major components of this process were the following missions mercury program  a single astronaut program designed at determining if successful earth orbit could be achieved this program lasted  years – and saw  flights gemini program  a program for the launch of spacecraft manned by two astronauts the program was designed to test the endurance of astronauts in space the longest gemini mission was  days as well as the ability to rendezvous and dock with another spacecraft this program lasted  years – and saw  flights apollo program  these spacecraft were manned by three astronauts with the aim of lunar orbit then landing this was achieved on july   when apollo  reached the lunar surface see more on programs at end of chapter altogether there were  landings on the moon the first three apollo’s  returned lunar samples that were extremely local to the landing site no one wanted to wander too far away from the lander vehicle the last three apollos  took a dune buggy with them and drove around the lunar surface in order to perform more extensive sampling from the analysis of returned lunar samples the following sequence of events regarding the geological history of the moon have been determined the oldest rocks on the moon found in the lunar highlands are  billion years old since the oldest rocks in the solar system are  billion years old this would seem to imply the accretion formation timescale is  billion years  million years the rocks found in the ejecta blanket near craters are  billion years old the rocks near the lunar maria are  billion years old the basalt rock that comprises the lunar maria is  billion years old no rocks younger than  billion years have been found – the moon has been geologically dead for quite some time the age dating of the lunar rocks have allowed us to identify four distinct periods in its geological history the moon solidified and cooled  billion years ago between  and  billion years and intense period of bombardment occurred from the material that was left over from the accretion process most of this material was chunks of rock less than  km in size by now the moon is tidally locked to the earth at  billion years there was another period of bombardment which involved a few large   km pieces of debris these large impacts produced the lunar maria this was a severe shock to the crust of the moon and over time molten basalt would flow out of the deep fissures and cracks in the crust that were caused by the initial impact this took  million years to occur and was the last geological process to occur on the moon origin of the moon the moon has long been an anomaly because its mass compared to the earth is  and there is very large for a planetary satellite possibilities for lunar origin formed in place by accretion with same planetesimals that formed the earth probably not its composition is different from earth’s formed someplace else where the average density is  less dense things formed in outer solar system  implies formation near mars – then how did it get here fissioned from the earth’s mantle note the density of the earth’s mantle is around  – but how by what mechanism note that the moon forms from earth mantle material which is low in density around  or so since the moon formed from the condensation of a debris ring in relatively nearearth orbit the moon was initially quite close to the earth at this time  billion years ago the earth was rotating quite rapidly about once every  hours the nearby moon exerted large tidal forces on the spinning earth causing it to slow down this process continues to day to conserve total system angular momentum see end of chapter the response of the moon is then to move farther away from the earth   mercury mercury is the smallest of the major planets with a radii of only  km  miles since it is the closest planet to the sun its greatest elongation is only  degrees ie its only visible right after sunset or right before sunrise from its radius ie volume and mass we calculate it has a mean density of  gcm which implies a dense iron fe core all planets form as molten balls then cool and solidify the cooling rate is proportional to the amount of material the planet’s mass and its surface area its radius since mercury is low in mass less heat stored from formation its core is probably solid rather than liquid the rotation period of mercury is  days and its orbital period year is  days notice that  times  is  thus mercury suffers from spinorbit coupling where the tidal forces from the sun has locked mercury’s rotation into a resonance number     etc… more on resonance at end of chapter daytime temperatures on the surface of mercury hover around  degrees kelvin enough to melt lead more on kelvin at end of chapter whereas at night the ground temperature plunge to a mere  kelvins air turns to liquid at  kelvins dawn is ten times more brilliant than on the earth since the sun is ten times larger the lack of any significant atmosphere means that before dawn you can see the sun’s corona spreading over the horizon the above image is a photomosaic of mercury was constructed from photos taken by mariner  six hours after the spacecraft flew past the planet on march   the north pole is at the top and the equator extends from left to right about twothirds down from the top a large circular basin about  kilometers  miles in diameter is emerging from the daynight terminator at left center bright rayed craters are prominent in this view of mercury one such ray seems to join in both eastwest and northsouth directions the above mosaic shows the caloris basin located halfway in shadow on the morning terminator caloris is latin for heat and the basin is named this because it is near the subsolar point the point closest to the sun when mercury is at aphelion caloris basin is  kilometers  miles in diameter and is the largest know structure on mercury it was formed from an impact of a projectile with asteroid dimensions the interior floor of the basin contains smooth plains but is highly ridged and fractured north is towards the top of this image the above “weird terrain” best describes this hilly region of mercury this area is at the antipodal point from the large caloris basin the shock wave produced by the caloris impact was reflected and focused to this antipodal point thus jumbling the crust and breaking it into a series of complex blocks the area covered is about  kilometers  miles on a side   the above picture is a mariner  image shows santa maria rupes the sinuous dark feature running through the crater at the center of this image note how is passes through the crater rim indicating that it was created after the impact crater many such features were discovered in the mariner images of mercury and are interpreted to be enormous thrust faults where part of the mercurian crust was pushed slightly over an adjacent part by compressional forces the abundance and length of the thrust faults indicate that the radius of mercury decreased by  kilometers  –  miles after the solidification and impact cratering of the surface this volume change probably was due to the cooling of the planet following the formation of a metallic core threefourths the size of the planet north is towards the top and is  kilometers  miles across surface features in general the surface of mercury is similar to the moon ie heavily cratered due to a lack of a heavy atmosphere to erode away primordial impacts however there are some key differences  there are few maria on mercury and they are small no large impact era like the moon therefore mercury must have cooled faster  cratering is less heavy more plain region between craters due to the higher surface gravity on mercury you weight more than on mercury than the moon this means impacts did not throw debris as far fewer secondary craters and more concentrated around primary crater    long scarps or wrinkles are found on the crust and the tops of craters ie after cratering epoch after mercury cooled its crust solidified first mercury was still rotating quickly back then and had an equatorial bulge as mercury slowed in its rotation due to tidal forces with the sun gravity pulled mercury into a more spherical shape and the crust had to fold producing long scarps mercury’s magnetic field although mercury has a high density implying it is rich in iron fe almost no fe is detected by spectroscopy of its surface thus most of the fe must has sunk into the core while mercury was young and molten and that it must have stayed in a molten state for much longer than the other planets formed at the same time these facts are confirmed by the fact that mercury has a strong magnetic field even though it rotates slowly this implies a liquid core for mercury which is in contradiction with the theory that the core is solid from cooling arguments one possible solution is that the core is a mixture of iron and some other material such as sulfur mercury’s strong magnetic field also gives it a very weak atmosphere planet’s as hot as mercury quickly lose their atmosphere’s as the high temperatures heat the atmosphere molecules to escape velocity however mercury is very close to the sun and is able to capture some of the sun’s solar wind composed of protons and electrons in its magnetic field giving it a very thin and tenuous atmosphere   basalt basalt is an extrusive igneous volcanic rock that is low in silica content dark in colour and comparatively rich in iron and magnesium the dominant igneous rock on the earth’s surface is basalt it appears that such is also the case on earth’s close neighbours the lunar maria are covered with basalt lava flows these lunar basalts have a mineralogy similar to that of terrestrial basalts but chemically they have no water a lower amount of alkalis and alumina and a higher iron oxide and chromium content on the lunar highlands plagioclaserich rocks are most common these include anorthosites gabbros troctolites olivineplagioclase rock and minor basalt it appears that basalt is common on mars as well the large shield volcano olympus mons must have been formed from eruptions of fluid basalt flows the xray fluorescence analyses performed by the vikings  and  landers showed that the rocks are basaltic venus apparently has volcanic features but full chemical analysis has not yet revealed the rock compositions albedo basalt is an extrusive igneous volcanic rock that is low in silica content dark in colour and comparatively rich in iron and

apparently has volcanic features but full chemical analysis has not yet revealed the rock compositions   refractory elements the term refractory metals denotes metals with a very high melting point but it is used somewhat arbitrarily in the metals industry for example the refractory metals committee organized under the metallurgical society of the american institute of mining metallurgical and petroleum engineers uses the term refractory to cover only metals with melting points above about  c  f however according to the metals handbook published by the american society for metals the refractory metals are those “metals having melting points above the range of iron cobalt and nickel” this broader definition would include tungsten molybdenum tantalum niobium chromium vanadium and some less common metals this section discusses niobium vanadium tungsten and molybdenum chromium is discussed above with manganese tantalum is omitted from discussion owing to its limited commercial use volatile elements since the late s important advances have been made in the chemical analysis of both meteorites and the sun a remarkable result has emerged from this work although at one time there appeared to be major differences between the sun and typical meteorites in the ratios of elements to one another eg iron to silicon these differences tended to disappear as the accuracy of the measurements improved it turned out that for most meteorites and most elements the solar and meteoritic values of the element ratios relative to silicon taken as a standard agreed to within better than a factor of two two kinds of exceptions to this rule were found relative to the sun the meteorites were deficient in the more volatile elements for the most volatile elements hydrogen and the noble gases the deficiencies were gross–more than a factor of  for less volatile elements the deficiencies were smaller and for the nonvolatile elements or “refractory” elements such as iron magnesium aluminum and calcium the meteoritic and solar abundance ratios were identical within the accuracy of the data mercury space program initiated in  completed in  project mercury was the united states’ first maninspace program the objectives of the program which made six manned flights from  to  were specific to orbit a manned spacecraft around earth to investigate man’s ability to function in space to recover both man and spacecraft safely the united states’ first manned space flight project was successfully accomplished in a   year period of dynamic activity which saw more than  people from many major government agencies and much of the aerospace industry combine their skills initiative and experience into a national effort in this period six manned space flights were accomplished as part of a flight program these manned space flights were accomplished with complete pilot safety and without change to the basic mercury concepts it was shown that man can function ably as a pilotengineerexperimenter without undesirable reactions or deteriorations of normal body functions for periods up to  hours of weightless flight directing this large and fast moving project required the development of a management structure and operating mode that satisfied the requirement to mold the many different entities into a workable structure the management methods and techniques so developed are discussed other facets of the mercury experience such as techniques and philosophies developed to insure welltrained flight and ground crews and correctly prepared space vehicles are discussed also those technical areas of general application to aerospace activities that presented obstacles to the accomplishment of the project are briefly discussed emphasis is placed on the need for improved detail design guidelines and philosophy complete and appropriate hardware qualification programs more rigorous standards accurate and detailed test procedures and more responsive configuration control techniques the actual beginning of the effort that resulted in manned space flight cannot be pinpointed although it is known that the thought has been in the mind of man throughout recorded history it was only in the last decade however that technology had developed to the point where man could actually transform his ideas into hardware to achieve space flight specific studies and tests conducted by government and industry culminating in  indicated the feasibility of manned space flight implementation was initiated to establish a national manned spaceflight project later named project mercury on october   the life of project mercury was about   years from the time of its official goahead to the completion of the hour orbital mission of astronaut cooper during this period much has been learned about man’s capabilities in the space environment and his capabilities in earthbound activities which enabled the successful accomplishment of the objectives of the mercury project in this relatively short period it is the purpose of this paper to review the more significant facets of the project beginning with the objectives of the project and the guidelines which were established to govern the activity as in any form of human endeavor there are certain signs which serve as the outward indication of activity and progress for the mercury project these signs were the major fullscale flight tests these tests will be reviewed with particular emphasis on schedule the individual mission objectives and the results from each mission then the organization with which management directed the activities of project mercury will be explained particularly with respect to those internal interfaces between major segments of nasa and those external interfaces with contractors and other governmental departments the resources expended during the project will be explained with discussions on manpower and cost in addition the major results of the project will be discussed as will those areas which presented severe obstacles to technical progress project gemini the second us manned space program was announced in january  its twoman crew gave it its name gemini for the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux gemini involved  flights including two unmanned flight tests of the equipment like mercury’s its major objectives were clearcut to subject man and equipment to space flight up to two weeks in duration to rendezvous and dock with orbiting vehicles and to maneuver the docked combination by using the target vehicle’s propulsion system to perfect methods of entering the atmosphere and landing at a preselected point on land its goals were also met with the exception of a land landing which was cancelled in    the national aeronautics and space administration announced december   a plan to extend the existing manned space flight program by development of a twoman spacecraft the program was officially designated gemini on january   it was named after the third constellation of the zodiac featuring the twin stars castor and pollux the program was operationally completed with the gemini xii flight apollo program project apollo’s goals went beyond landing americans on the moon and returning them safely to earth to establish the technology to meet other national interests in space to achieve preeminence in space for the united states to carry out a program of scientific ex ploration of the moon and to develop man’s capability to work in the lunar environment apollo was a threepart spacecraft the command module cm the crew’s quarters and flight control section the service module sm for the propulsion and spacecraft support systems when together the two modules are called csm and the lunar module lm the cm and lm would separate after lunar orbit insertion one crew member would stay in the cm which would orbit the moon while the other two astronauts would take the lm down to the lunar surface after exploring the surface setting up experiments taking pictures collecting rock samples etc the astronauts would return to the cm for the journey back to earth six of the missions apollos      and  landed humans on the moon and bought them safely back to earth apollos  and  were earth orbiting missions to test the command and lunar modules and did not return lunar data apollos  and  tested various components while orbiting the moon and returned photography of the lunar surface apollo  did not land on the moon due to a malfunction but also returned photographs the six missions that landed on the moon returned a wealth of scientific data and almost  kilograms of lunar samples experiments included soil mechanics meteoroids seismic heat flow lunar ranging magnetic fields and solar wind experiments angular momentum angular momentum is a property characterizing the rotary inertia of an object or system of objects in motion about an axis that may or may not pass through the object or system the earth has orbital angular momentum by reason of its annual revolution about the sun and spin angular momentum because of its daily rotation about its axis angular momentum is a vector quantity requiring the specification of both a magnitude and a direction for its complete description the magnitude of the angular momentum of an orbiting object is equal to its linear momentum product of its mass m and linear velocity v times the perpendicular distance r from the centre of rotation to a line drawn in the direction of its instantaneous motion and passing through the object’s centre of gravity or simply mvr for a spinning object on the other hand the angular momentum must be considered as the summation of the quantity mvr for all the particles composing the object for a given object or system isolated from external forces the total angular momentum is a constant a fact that is known as the law of conservation of angular momentum a rigid spinning object for example continues to spin at a constant rate and with a fixed orientation unless influenced by the application of an external torque the rate of change of the angular momentum is in fact equal to the applied torque a figure skater spins faster or has a greater angular velocity when the arms are drawn inward because this action reduces the moment of inertia i while the the skater’s angular momentum remains constant because of the conservation of direction as well as magnitude a spinning gyrocompass in an airplane remains fixed in its orientation independent of the motion of the airplane resonance resonance is a relatively large selective response of an object or a system that vibrates in step or phase with an externally applied oscillatory force resonance was first investigated in acoustical systems such as musical instruments and the human voice an example of acoustical resonance is the vibration induced in a violin or piano string of a given pitch when a musical note of the same pitch is sung or played nearby the concept of resonance has been extended by analogy to certain mechanical and electrical phenomena mechanical resonance such as that produced in bridges by wind or by marching soldiers is known to have built up to proportions large enough to be destructive as in the case of the destruction of thetacoma narrows bridge in  spacecraft aircraft and surface vehicles must be designed so that the vibrations caused by their engines or by their movement through air are kept to a safe minimum kelvin there are three temperature scales in use today fahrenheit celsius and kelvinfahrenheit temperature scale is a scale based on  for the freezing point of water and  for the boiling point of water the interval between the two being divided into  parts the thcentury german physicist daniel gabriel fahrenheit originally took as the zero of his scale the temperature of an equal icesalt mixture and selected the values of  and  for the freezing point of water and normal body temperature respectively these later were revised to  and  but the final scale required an adjustment to  for the latter value until the s the fahrenheit temperature scale was in general common use in englishspeaking countries the celsius or centigrade scale was employed in most other countries and for scientific purposes worldwide since that time however most englishspeaking countries have officially adopted the celsius scale the conversion formula for a temperature that is expressed on the celsius c scale to its fahrenheit f representation is f  c   celsius temperature scale also called centigrade temperature scale is the scale based on  for the freezing point of water and  for the boiling point of water invented in  by the swedish astronomer anders celsius it is sometimes called the centigrade scale because of the degree interval between the defined points the following formula can be used to convert a temperature from its representation on the fahrenheit  f scale to the celsius c value c  f –  the celsius scale is in general use wherever metric units have become accepted and it is used in scientific work everywhere kelvin temperature scale is the base unit of thermodynamic temperature measurement in the international system si of measurement it is defined as   of the triple point equilibrium among the solid liquid and gaseous phases of pure water the kelvin symbol k without the degree sign  is also the fundamental unit of the kelvin scale an absolute temperature scale named for the british physicist william thomson baron kelvin such a scale has as its zero point absolute zero the theoretical temperature at which the molecules of a substance have the lowest energy many physical laws and formulas can be expressed more simply when an absolute temperature scale is used accordingly the kelvin scale has been adopted as the international standard for scientific temperature measurement the kelvin scale is related to the celsius scale the difference between the freezing and boiling points of water is  degrees in each so that the kelvin has the same magnitude as the degree celsius search for this site is maintained by
