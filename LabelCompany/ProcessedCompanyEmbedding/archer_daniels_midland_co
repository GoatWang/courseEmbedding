tailwindsjun  about archer daniels adm jonathan wheeler growth at reasonable price longterm horizon dividend growth investingsummaryadm is a leader in the processing storage and transportation of raw ingredients globally population growth and continued global expansion will remain tailwinds for the company tough competition a shifting product landscape and tight margins are key risks going forward but the stock is trading around fair value and will likely drive meaningful longterm returns archer daniels midland nyseadm is a food products company that specializes in processing raw ingredients and providing transportation and storage services the business is highly cyclical due to commodity prices and the nature of crop fluctuations but it has managed to hike its dividend every year for  consecutive years making it a dividend aristocrat the companys moat lies in its infrastructure but poor returns on capital and tight margins are definite risks going forward the stock is trading at fair value and population growth remains a strong tailwind for the company source analyst presentation adm operates in a tough business due to the cyclical nature of its products the tough competition and the thin margins in the best of times therefore it is even more impressive that the company has maintained its dividend streak it is a testament to the conservative nature of the company since many cyclicals cut the dividend the moment the macro environment shifts the current ceo juan ricardo luciano is only the th in the history of the  year old company close to  of revenues are derived from outside the united states and that is where the majority of the companys growth will be found china remains a strong market for the companys products and the company has continued to expand there as well as other emerging markets population growth leads to a larger demand for foods more feed requirements for livestock and increased use of the processed ingredients that adm offers the global nature of the business leads to significant currency risk which has weighed on many multinationals over the last couple of years source analyst presentation source analyst presentation adm had a tough  dipping below  a share for a short time due to depressed earnings early in the year that made the comparison this last quarter much better with earnings growing by about  on an adjusted basis in the annual report the ceo had this to say about last years difficult environment with relatively few exceptions  unfolded as we expected the macroeconomic and industry conditions that weighed down our financial results in  — including large global crop supplies and both low prices and volatility that limited merchandising opportunities — persisted through much of the first half of  during this period we implemented operational efficiency projects that by year’s end resulted in over  million in runrate cost savings we captured nearly  million in incremental revenues from recent investments and we monetized nearly  million of assets that were no longer strategic for adm which allowed us to redeploy this capital toward more productive uses we anticipate reaching  billion in monetized assets by the end of  the key to a great company operating in a cyclical industry is the ability to maintain costs in lean times and to deploy cash when times are tough by acquiring companies or taking market share adm has been pretty acquisitive as management continues to hone the companys footprint and portfolio to maximize the revenue base and thin margins underperforming businesses have been divested and the acquisition of wild flavors and companies like chamtor a french sweetener company should help diversify adm away from some of the more cyclical products that it processes additionally the company continues to engage in joint ventures across the globe to expand its facility footprint and open new growth runways source analyst presentation however the company doesnt have the moat that many of its dividend aristocrat peers have although the company has obviously been managed well to have been able to hike its dividend for  years while maintaining a  payout ratio today its low returns on capital and margins show that it is in a highly competitive and capital intensive industry additionally the products that the company sells arent really that different from its competitors due to the huge scale of its processing facilities worldwide it isnt likely that an upstart company will be able to mimic the companys cost benefits however it takes constant improvement and investment to hold on to market share a final risk to consider is that  of the larger products that adm produces are ethanol and high fructose corn syrup changes to the ethanol requirements for gasoline could have a material impact on results going forward there is a possibility of ethanol blending requirements increasing or decreasing in the future either way it is out of the companys hands additionally the pushback on high fructose corn syrup is one of the reasons that the company has been investing in its recent acquisitions just like many consumer staples companies adm will benefit from shifting towards more natural ingredients to suit todays consumers adm free cash flow nysettm data by ychartsadm has a conservative payout ratio around  of earnings and its long term debt is reasonable dividend growth was slow this last year which is fine considering the depressed earnings the company was dealing with capital expenditures have been stable which allow the company to generate close to b in free cash flow pretty consistently all in all the financial picture looks pretty healthy adm looks to be trading right around fair value today its dividend yield at  is at or above its long term average and the pe ratio is not a reliable indicator due to depressed earnings however looking at the graph above one can see that the stock will be trading right around the companys long term average once earnings recover later in the year an investment today would yield  annualized on a return to the companys longterm valuation based on analyst estimates i see adm as a great operator in a tough business which will continue to reward shareholders over the longterm longterm tailwinds from population growth and expansion into new global markets will likely drive strong
