stocks  michael salzhauer age  resides in new york new york michael salzhauer is henry salzhauers son and he works along with his father managing the familys real estate and securities investments the injunctive action alleged and the order found the following facts under applicable federal and state banking regulations when a savings bank converts from a mutuallyowned to a stockowned financial institution depositors have a priority subscription right to purchase the banks stock before the bank sells the stock to the general public to ensure that only depositors benefit from their priority stock subscription rights federal and state regulations prohibit depositors from transferring ownership of those rights or of the stock itself prior to completion of the conversion typically the price of the stock that a bank offers when the bank converts to stock ownership rises significantly after conversion thus affording depositors the opportunity to obtain a significant profit on resale of their stock after conversion sisb which maintained its headquarters in staten island rcsb which had branches in brooklyn and staten island and isb which had branches throughout the new york metropolitan area were mutually owned institutions that converted to stock ownership between october  and march  the salzhauers and vito valentini learned about these conversions and they were well aware of the profit opportunity associated with the sisb rcsb and isb depositors subscription rights the salzhauers and valentini also knew that only the depositors lawfully could exercise those

had sole discretion to sell the stock  to the extent that the proceeds from the stock sales were not sufficient to cover the salzhauers purchase cost the salzhauers agreed to look only to the value of the stock for their repayment  the salzhauers received the proceeds of the stock sales up to the amount of the original purchase cost plus an interest charge  the salzhauers also received  of any proceeds of the sales above the original purchase cost ie  of the profit and  the depositors received the remainder of the sale proceeds as the salzhauers and valentini knew converting banks required the depositors to sign subscription agreements that contained a written certification that the depositors were purchasing the banks conversion stock for their own account and that the depositors had entered into no agreement or understanding regarding the sale or transfer of their shares the certifications that the sisb rcsb and isb depositors signed were false in fact the depositors were not purchasing the stock solely for their own account and they had entered into the agreement with the salzhauers described above after sisbs rcsbs and isbs conversion stock was issued to the depositors henry salzhauer sold the stock at a significant profit which he and michael salzhauer split evenly with the depositors each depositor in turn paid between  and  percent of their profit to valentini
