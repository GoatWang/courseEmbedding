this offering as well as the proceeds from the proposed aquamarine driller financing to finance the final construction payment for the aquamarine driller  and use the remainder for general corporate purposes and working capital the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with contracts traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis the technical capabilities availability and pricing of a drilling unit are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job other key factors include a contractor’s reputation for service safety record environmental record technical and engineering support and longterm relationships with national and international oil and natural gas companies our competitors in the offshore contract drilling industry generally have larger more diverse fleets longer operating histories that have established safety and environmental records over a measurable period of time experienced inhouse technical and engineering support departments and longterm relationships with customers this provides our competitors with competitive advantages that may adversely affect our efforts to contract the drilling units on favorable terms if at all and correspondingly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations the offshore contract drilling industry historically has been very cyclical with periods of high demand limited supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand excess supply and low dayrates periods of low demand and excess supply intensify competition in the industry and often result in some drilling units becoming idle for long periods of time our lack of operating history may put us at a competitive disadvantage and result in our drilling units being idle prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates or extended idle time could result in the recognition of impairment charges on our drilling units if cash flow estimates based upon information available to management at the time indicate that the carrying value of the drilling units may not be recoverable company description our primary business is to contract drilling units related equipment and work crews primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells we also provide construction supervision services for and will operate and manage drilling units owned by

local tax obligations related thereto or any franchise tax obligations the proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisition with which we complete a business combination excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriters discount any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to finance our operations which may include the target businesses we acquired on the consummation of the business combination to effect other acquisitions or for working capital as determined by our board of directors at that time all amounts held in the trust account that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest income net of income taxes will be released on closing of our initial business combination with a target acquisition having a fair market value of at least  of our net assets excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriters discount at the time of such business combination subject to a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor of the business combination and less than  of the public stockholders voting against the business combination and electing their conversion rights the  threshold is  in most similar entities we have agreed to pay a monthly fee of approximately  for office space located in the houston metropolitan area the lease term is for  months and the lessor is unaffiliated with the company the landlord for the lease is gateway ridgecrest inc as part of the negotiation the landlord required a  month lease term if we were to secure the lease for the space in the event that a business combination is not approved within  months paul bragg has agreed to assume personally the responsibility for the balance of the lease payments for the remaining fourteen months we intend to use the  of net proceeds not held in trust for due diligence legal accounting fees and expenses of the acquisition including investment banking fees and other expenses including structuring and negotiating business combination as well as a possible down payment reverse break up fees a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained lockup or noshop provision a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target acquisitions from shopping around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target acquisitions if necessary to bear the costs of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business combination by may   while we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination if we were to enter into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target acquisition the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time our forfeiture of such funds whether as a result of our breach or otherwise could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for or conducting due diligence with respect to potential target acquisitions in addition to the use of funds described above we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target acquisition we believe that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses to the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination or in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other net proceeds not expended be used as working capital to finance our operations in the event that third party indebtedness is used as consideration our officers and directors would not be personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness we may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business combination either because the consideration for the business combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities in such event the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations which may include the target businesses that we acquire on the business combination to effect other acquisitions or for working capital as determined by our board of directors at that time we may use these funds among other things for director and officer compensation changeincontrol payments or payments to affiliates to finance the operations of the target acquisition to make other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy in the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering our officers and directors would be personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness our officers and directors have advanced to us a total of  which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for sec registration fees nasd registration fees amex application and listing fees blue sky filing fees and legal and audit fees and expenses the loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of january   or the consummation of this offering the loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not held in trust the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in united states government securities within the meaning of section a of the investment company act of  with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a promulgated under the investment company act of  although the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account and although we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take to complete a business combination we anticipate the interest that will accrue on the trust account even at an interest rate of  up to  interest income net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust account during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements while we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate we believe such rate is representative of that which we may receive by restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the investment company act of  notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act we will not liquidate and distribute the trust account to holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existence terminates by operation of law on may   and consequently we may be deemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act the interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a business combination will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations including associated professional fees until a business combination is completed we do not believe that the fees and expenses for due diligence legal accounting acquisition down payment lockup or other activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed  in the aggregate comprised of  of net proceeds not held in trust plus up to  of net interest income based upon the experience of the members of our board and consultation with them regarding a reasonable budget for consummating a transaction of this kind and nature and a review of budgets publicly disclosed by blankcheck companies we determined that this was an appropriate approximation of the expenses if costs are higher than expected we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for or conduct due diligence with respect to any potential target acquisitions in such case we would need to obtain additional funds from our initial stockholders or another source to continue operations we believe that upon consummation of this offering we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next  months assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time commencing april   and for  months thereafter we will pay a monthly fee of approximately  for office space in the houston metropolitan area the landlord for the lease is gateway ridgecrest inc as part of the negotiation the landlord required a  month lease term if we were to secure the lease for the space in the event that a business combination is not approved within  months paul bragg has agreed to assume personally the responsibility for the balance of the lease payments for the remaining fourteen months we will also seek to obtain administrative services including secretarial support from unaffiliated third parties at prevailing market rates we have no arrangement with vanderbilt interests llc and we do not currently anticipate any requirement for its services the only obligation for space as of the date of prospectus is with gateway ridgecrest inc no compensation of any kind including finders consulting or other similar fees will be paid to any of our existing officers directors or stockholders or any of their affiliates prior to or for any services that they render in order to effectuate or in connection with the consummation of the business combination however such persons will receive reimbursement subject to board approval for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target acquisitions performing business due diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target acquisitions to examine their operations reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in the above table to legal accounting and other expenses due diligence of prospective target acquisitions and working capital since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after a business combination a public stockholder but not our founding stockholders with respect to any shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering or purchased in the private placement will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account including interest earned on such stockholders portion of the trust account net of taxes payable and amounts disbursed for working capital purposes only in the event of our liquidation of the trust account as part of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination or if such public stockholder converts his shares of common stock into cash in connection with a business combination that the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account founding stockholders directors and officers are not entitled to convert any of their shares of common stock acquired prior to this offering in this offering after this offering or in the private placement into a pro rata share of the trust account upon the consummation of a business combination the underwriters will be entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the underwriters discount held in trust excluding any accrued interest thereon in the event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account the underwriters have agreed that i they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon and ii the proceeds attributable to the underwriters discount will be distributed on a prorata basis among the public stockholders along with any accrued interest thereon we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies and other entities domestic and international competing for the type of businesses that we may intend to acquire many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting directly or indirectly acquisitions of energy related and oilfield services businesses many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors our ability to compete with respect to large acquisitions will be limited by our available financial resources giving a competitive advantage to other acquirers with greater resources our competitors may adopt transaction structures similar to ours which would decrease our competitive advantage in offering flexible transaction terms in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties assets and entities may increase resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for such investments if we pay higher prices for a target business our profitability may decrease and we may experience a lower return on our investments increased competition may also preclude us from acquiring those properties assets and entities that would generate the most attractive returns to us further the following may not be viewed favorably by certain target acquisitions •our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be included in the proxy statement to be sent to stockholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction •our obligation to convert into cash shares of common stock held by our public stockholders in certain instances may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination •the requirement to acquire assets or an operating business that has a fair market value equal to at least  of our net assets held in trust net of taxes and excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriters discount at the time of the acquisition could require us to acquire several assets or closely related operating businesses at the same time all of which sales would be contingent on the closings of the other sales which could make it more difficult to consummate the business combination and •our outstanding warrants and unit purchase option and the potential future dilution they represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target acquisition we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we are a blank check company organized under the laws of the state of delaware on september   we were formed to acquire through a merger capital stock exchange asset or stock acquisition exchangeable share transaction joint venture or other similar business combination one or more businesses in the oilfield services industry to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities we do not have any specific business combination under consideration nor have we had any discussions with any target business regarding a possible business combination our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in the energy industry as managers principals or directors of worldwide energy companies in addition they collectively comprise a formidable pool of expertise covering the key areas of the energy industry with experience in

prospective target business or businesses in the oilfield services industry and negotiating the terms of such transaction we will not consider or seek business opportunities in industries other than

the energy industry will be valuable with respect to operating any business we may acquire according to the energy information administration demand for energy in the global economy will increase from  quadrillion btu in  to  quadrillion btu in  according to spears  associates worldwide spending in the oilfield services sector is scheduled to increase from  billion in  to  billion in  since our

target acquisition or had any discussions formal or otherwise with respect to such a transaction from the period prior to our formation through the date of this prospectus there have been no communications or discussions between any of our officers and directors and any of their potential contacts or relationships regarding a potential business combination additionally we have not nor has anyone on our behalf taken any measure directly or indirectly to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate if we are unable to consummate a business combination within the allotted time periods set forth in this prospectus and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation we will liquidate our trust account and any other assets to our public stockholders while we may seek to effect business transactions with more than one target acquisition our business combination must be with a target acquisition or acquisitions whose fair market value is at least equal to  of our net assets held in trust net of taxes and amounts disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriters discount at the time of such acquisition consequently initially we may have the ability to complete only a single business combination although this may entail our acquisition of one or more individual assets properties or entities in the event we ultimately determine to simultaneously acquire several assets or properties and such assets or properties are owned by different sellers we may need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions which may make it more difficult for us and delay our ability to complete the business combination with multiple acquisitions we could also face additional risks including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations if there are multiple sellers and the additional risks associated with the subsequent integration of the multiple assets or properties into a single operating entity our business combination may take the form of a joint venture wherein we acquire less than a  ownership interest in certain properties assets or entities in such case the remaining ownership interest may be held by third parties who may or may not have been involved with the properties assets or entities prior to our acquisition of such ownership interest with a joint venture we will face additional risks including the additional costs and time required to investigate and otherwise conduct due diligence on potential joint venture partners and to negotiate joint venture agreements moreover the subsequent management and control of a joint venture will entail risks associated with multiple owners and decision makers we may further seek to acquire a target acquisition that has a fair market value significantly in excess of  of our net assets held in trust net of taxes and amounts disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriters discount in order to do so we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities and the company may effect a business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account in the case of a business combination funded with assets other than the trust assets the proxy materials disclosing the business combination for which we would seek stockholder approval would disclose the terms of the financing as well and if required by law or by regulation of the american stock exchange we would seek stockholder approval of such financing in the absence of a requirement by law or a regulation of the american stock exchange for example if such financing involves the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into common stock which could result in an increase in our outstanding common stock of  or more we would not seek separate stockholder approval of such financing inasmuch as the financing portion of any business combination would be disclosed in the proxy materials and would be a consideration of the stockholder approval process for the business combination under consideration there are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans that would allow us to acquire a company with a fair market value in an amount greater than  of our net assets held in trust at the time of the acquisition at this time we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise  our principal executive offices are located at  post oak
