correspondent services why alexander alexander capital is an advisory practice offering full service investment banking and wealth management services  our firm is built on the principles of client needs and solutions and not product development and distribution  the large banks and brokerage firms build products that fill what consultants tell them clients need  we build what the client needs or go on a unbiased search process to deliver the best solution what is open architecture “open architecture allows us to provide a true advisory model to our clients  large banks and trust companies have a shelf of products approved for a bucket of clients  we cater investments and structures that fit each client  it may be a larger bank product or most likely one that is unique and not widely offered  we have the ability to study and examine a much larger sub set of what a client needs once you look past the walls of a large bank you can see the entire forest” ross bevevino managing director work with us without our people and the ability to attract and retain talent we would not be successful as a business able to support our corporate and investor clientele  we believe in the
