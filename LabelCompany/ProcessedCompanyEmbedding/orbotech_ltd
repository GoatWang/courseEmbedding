priceinteger investmentssummaryorbotech supplies manufacturing products and solutions to consumer electronics manufacturers such as samsung and foxconnthe consumer electronics industry continues to boom and emerging economies like china and india are likely to cause this trend to continuethe company’s strong positioning in the rapidgrowth industries of solar energy and autonomous vehicles should be watched closely this post is written by callum lo for integer investments introduction orbotech nasdaqorbk is one of the worlds largest suppliers of manufacturing solutions to electronics manufacturers it provides machinery and process solutions to manufacturers that create consumer electronics computing products solar cells and more the company describes itself as being a supplier of yieldenhancing and process enabling solutions essentially this means that it engineers better processes and equipment for companies like samsung otcssnlf and foxconn otcfxcof to produce products like flatscreen tvs and computers its emphasis is on improving the efficiency of production and eliminating defects in products through vigorous testing and highquality manufacturing methods industry outlook the consumer electronics industry is the main area to which orbotech supplies this includes mainstream products that all retail consumers are familiar with such as smartphones tablets monitors flatscreen tvs and wearables demand for these kinds of products is uniformly expected to continue rising as it has for the past decades orbotech supplies to all the major manufacturers of these kinds of products and even claims on its website that virtually every electronic device in the world is produced using orbotech systems research undertaken by credence research found that the global consumer electronics industry as a whole is set to grow by  per year until  compounded annually this equates to aggregate compounded growth of  over that time period orbotech equipment is used for all major consumer electronics products like flatscreen tvs a number of factors are cited in the report as pointing to such impressive and persistent growth over the next seven years to begin with a number of governments in the developing world are implementing sophisticated and widescale digital initiatives to upgrade their economies and provide digital products to large swathes of their populations nations with strong central government control such as china india and brazil are leading this charge with those three nations alone representing nearly  billion people or over  of the entire human population a focus on smartphones tablets and laptops within these programs is benefiting orbotech and its competitors as all of these products feature manufacturing solutions they produce nations such as these also are naturally experiencing increased demand for consumer electronics without the help of government intervention this is because of the ballooning urban population and rising middleclass incomes as a result of incredible growth and development in the past  years asia in particular continues to experience a boom in demand for consumer electronics that are commonplace in western nations orbotech produces semiconductors conversely the report notes several factors that may hinder growth in this industry wearable devices and other new innovations still have high price tags and are seen more as luxuries than items within the reach of the vast majority of consumers this means that demand is likely to be dampened to some extent particularly in poorer nations moreover the report highlights several data privacy and security concerns which may make consumers reluctant to fully embrace new technologies such as the internet of things within homes these caveats are small however and the broad outlook is extremely positive for consumer electronics moreover competition continues to increase and become more aggressive among manufacturers and retailers which serves to benefit orbotech as its potential customer base expands financial outlook orbotech had a solid financial year in  in terms of total sales with revenue rising from  million in  to  million an increase of  the company also has a sizeable amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand compared to its total amount of debt as of december   total cash cash equivalents shortterm bank deposits and marketable securities were valued at a total of  million this amounts to nearly three times as much as the total debt the firm currently owes which sat at  million at the end of the year the reporting for the fourth quarter of  was a mixed bag with earnings that many considered to be disappointing at the same time the gross margin rose to  and the ceo communicated the companys optimism for the future highlighting increased electronic content in smartphones and automobiles as reasons at the time of november  a number of analysts have argued that the companys shares presently trade at a discount when compared to other similar companies in the same industry this is despite fairly strong growth and profitability forecasts and steps being taken by the firm to diversify its business interests in order to mitigate the cyclical nature of the industry it operates in the share price sat at a low of  at the beginning of november  before rising substantially to reach  at the end of january since that time it has fallen somewhat and currently trades at around  this indicates that the companys promising prospects may have now been priced in by the market and that it no longer trades at a discount however should the stock price continue its current trend of steadily decreasing without any change in the fundamental outlook for the industry and company investors should consider looking into a long position on the stock analysis in the past orbotech has successfully outgrown the market in which it operates indicating that it has found innovative ways to reduce costs and boost demand above and beyond the systemic forces that benefit them through the rise of consumer electronics in the fourth quarter of  orbotech had a very successful period for one of its key products  the printed circuit board a printed circuit board is a simple but very useful innovation in the field of electronics which saves the need to have a large amount of complex wiring going pointtopoint in a laborious way that often led to failures the printed circuit board by contrast is a small substrate board with various different lines and pads on it these allow electrical signals to move easily between components using solder which conducts energy and adheres to the board a printed circuit board according to orbotech ceo asher levy during the companys q  earnings call the printed circuit board division continued to perform well during the fourth quarter overall our product sales for the pcb division grew by more than  despite overall decline in industry growth this achievement is primarily the result of excellent execution of the division strategy combining the launch of new solutions with the new manufacturing technologies while maintaining our leadership in existing category which is positive growth by the introduction of new products launched during the first half of  which had become a significant driver of our growth trajectory in this division source company presentation this indicates that the firm may also be able to weather a decline in demand for consumer electronics provided it continues to innovate with new manufacturing solutions and better processes given the instability of nations like china which are currently driving the growth in the consumer electronics market this is an important factor to be aware of moreover consumer electronics for a number of products such as smartphones may reach saturation point in developed economies and experience a rapid drop off in demand as a result so far companies like apple nasdaqaapl have been able to avoid this downside by constantly coming out with improved products and better features as this becomes more and more difficult to do at such a rapid pace market saturation may present a risk to companies like orbotech that being said electronics companies like sony nysesne and samsung continue to constantly innovate in their products to the benefit of companies like orbotech for example the company is certain to gain from the transition to higherdefinition tv screens and flexible flat screens as the manufacturing processes involved in their production become more complex solar industry and autonomous vehicles orbotech invests in solar technologies through its subsidiary orbotech lt solar llc we recently wrote about the prospects of the solar industry in light of global competition and government incentives policies in that post about orion energy systems nysemktoesx we argued that exiting from the solar industry was a shrewd move the solar market has been noted for its everincreasing competition over the last few years as the technology reaches a critical point of viability and affordability the price of solar has dropped by  globally in the last five years driven in part by a sizeable supply glut in the international market in the united states solar now accounts for double the number of jobs as the coal industry china has also played a significant part in this trend they have been massmanufacturing solar cells in recent years to the point of having tariffs imposed on them by several western nations following allegations of dumping and unfair trade practices the industry has typically offset the challenges of new competition by benefiting from generous environmental subsidies offered by governments however this may be a crutch that the industry can no longer rely on as a strong sentiment in favor of rolling back such subsidies is beginning to emerge in both the united states and the united kingdom orbotech produces products that complement solar panels orbotech finds itself in a different position however the company produces products that are complementary to the production of solar cells so can ride the wave of a global solar supply glut to its advantage one of its key products is the aurora pecvd thin film at the time when the firm received a  million order for this system from solar panel manufacturers the ceo of orbotech lt solar commented conditions in the solar energy industry appear to be improving major suppliers are increasing their production levels and stepping up their capital spending making this a particularly opportune time to introduce our new deposition tool the industry of autonomous vehicles which currently stands on the precipice of being a massmarket industry will place high demands on products that orbotech produces autonomous vehicles require a large amount of computing power unlike traditional automobiles in order to map objects around them using a combination of lidar radar visual sensors and other technologies all of this must be done in real time which means that a huge amount of information is being processed at any one time in the next few years it is foreseeable that the most powerful computers being used by consumers will likely be in their cars orbotech has created a reputation for its semiconductors which are used in siliconbased processors as well as its advanced printed circuit boards a spike in the need for computing grunt as autonomous vehicles become commonplace will be favorable for orbotech autonomous vehicles use powerful computers to process real time data valuation in this section we produce a valuation for orbotech using a comparables analysis similar companies operating in the industry have been selected to compare in this case we did not incorporate electro scientific industries inc nasdaqesio due to its negative margins and multiples  camtek ltd nasdaqcamt  screen holdings co ltd otcdinry  cyberoptics corporation nasdaqcybe  applied materials

rockwell automation      orbotech      average exc orbotech      orbotech is growing in line with the industry and has a very similar expected operating margin also in recent years its eps has been growing steadily and is forecasted to keep growing for the next few years source simply wall st as a result the current pe ratio of  is quite low considering orbotechs strength in relation to other stocks applying the average pe multiple of  would lead to a stock price of   similarly applying the average evsales multiple of  we get a stock price of   finally applying an evebitda multiple the stock price would be worth almost double the current values however it should be noted that earnings for the firm tend to be extremely seasonal and vary a lot over time in the previous earnings call forecasted q earnings growth were little to nothing meaning that investors should be aware of the seasonality of the firms performance looking at the below graph that shows the seasonality of revenues per share it looks like there are quite a few risks in the short term source gurufocus conclusion orbotech remains a leader in the fields of electronics manufacturing and process optimization a booming consumer electronics industry is not a sure thing but looks likely to continue at least for the foreseeable future the company is well positioned to mitigate downside risk from a fall in demand company activities and investments taking place to take advantage of solar and autonomous vehicles technologies should be watched keenly as the company stands to benefit significantly from these emerging markets orbotechs stock price has been fairly changeable over the past few months it may well be that the companys solid financial footing and the fact that it stands to gain handsomely from current consumer trends are already priced into its market value if the price drops significantly in the future without any change in its fundamental outlook investors should consider buying it at this stage we are mostly concerned with the seasonality of the revenues and we believe that entering during this market phase is a risk as always thank you for reading if you wish to follow our

electronic industries an israeli holding company after  months of development optrotech was first to market with its firstgeneration automated optical inspection product although a number of other companies also had been working on their own automated inspection systems as the first to market optrotech was able to become the market leader in its field helping transform the printed circuit board industry enabling companies to begin the first of a series of productivity improvements the faster production times and greater volumes helped drive costs down and the steadily dropping prices of printed circuit boards provided still further stimulation for the development of the global electronics and computer industries in  a fellow israeli company orbot was founded by brothers yochai and kobi richter shimon ullman zvi lapidot and ami caspi with the financial backing of ormat industries orbot successfully launched competing automated optical inspection solutions and by  overtook optrotech as the aoi market leader in  optrotech had an initial public offering on nasdaq raising  million usd the funds raised enabled optrotech to develop the next generation of its automated

competitive position across technology manufacturingrelated product portfolioundervalued relative to peers   upside possible over  months on a daily basis i scan the markets for stocks that have traded sharply lower due to earnings misses weak guidance or negative press in an effort to find situations where the market has overreacted although most of the time there are legitimate reasons behind the size and pace of a selloff every now and then there are selloffs that are overdone this is the case with the recent selloff in orbotech nasdaqorbk after the company reported disappointing q earnings and q guidance a few weeks ago despite being an industry leader with a topnotch balance sheet and diversified revenue portfolio the stock fell over  resulting in valuation multiples below its peer group at these valuations shares of orbk have an attractive riskreward profile as i expect growth to accelerate across their divisions during  based on those growth expectations i believe that orbks valuation multiple should rebound to trade in line with those of the companys peers as a result shares should rebound to between  representing  upside from current levels overview orbk is a supplier of yieldenhancing and processenabling solutions for the electronics products manufacturing industry in plain english their products allow companies that manufacture electronics to efficiently produce complex products and minimize defects to maximize output the company is comprised of three divisions production solutions for the electronics industry solar energy and recognition software the production solutions for the electronics industry segment which represents  of revenue includes three subsegments printed circuit board pcb semiconductor devices sd and flat panel displays fpd source company presentation in the flat panel display fpd market orbks has established a marketleading position in the fastest growing segments including flex oled this position has resulted in increased bookings for  providing investors with improved visibility versus previous years in the printed circuit board pcb market orbks pcb repair tool allows customers to generate  yields in manufacturing thereby reducing costs and improving profitability as noted on the q conference call the pcb industry is expected to return to positive growth mode in  and management believes the pcb division will become an even more meaningful part of our growth in the semiconductor devices sdd market orbk is the leading company for fanout packaging a segment which is expected to grow and which orbk should be able to take market share within additionally orbk is gaining traction in the mems market which the company specifically noted on the q conference call on the call management noted they expect to see growth and demand for mems coming from the smartphones automotive internet of things and wearables application as has been widely reported these industries continue to add a variety of sensors for example for automated collision avoidance system autonomous drive vehicle and pedestrian sensing in automotive and new security feature such as fingerprint sensors in small devices based on orbks competitive position in its three main markets and the expected growth in each i expect sales to increase to m and m and eps to total share and share during  and  respectively ma growth prospects in addition to expecting strong organic revenue and earnings growth orbk has the balance sheet capacity to make additional strategic acquisitions specifically investors are hopeful that the company makes an acquisition in adjacent markets or further up the value chain however in addition to having the financial capacity to make acquisitions i believe orbk management has proven their ability to identify acquire and integrate acquisitions that deliver significant value for shareholders in  orbk acquired spts a ukbased manufacturer of etch and deposition processing equipment company targeting advanced packaging and mems markets the acquisition which is now the sdd division of orbk cost the company m m in debt m in cash and was priced at x sales over the last  years the acquisition has proven to be welltimed and wellexecuted since the acquisition the fanout advanced packaging and mems product lines have driven sdd division a cagr of  and supported overall company revenue growth source jefferies in addition proving their ability to identify attractive acquisition targets and execute after closing management has proven its ability to responsibly manage debt loads following acquisitions as of eoy the company had reduced total debt to m source simplywallst as reflected in the jefferies analysis below the company is in a strong position on both a cashdebt basis and net debt  fcf basis source jefferies given its strong financial position i would expect the company to pursue another large strategic acquisition in the next  months based on managements proven ability to create shareholder value through ma as represented by the stps acquisition i believe any ma announcement would be a positive catalyst for the share price valuation following the companys q earnings call on which the company reported weaker than expected q results and q guidance below consensus shares plunged over  source ycharts internal model to recap the company reported q revenue of m up  qq  yy which was below the midpoint of guidance and consensus due predominantly lower sd sales down  qq one bright spot of the report was the strength in the fpd and pcb segments which were  qq and  qq respectively gross margin came in at  which was below both guidance and consensus and was attributed to product mix foreign exchange and hedging losses overall the lower revenue and lower margins led to eps of  which was  below consensus as a result of the slow sdd sales in q the company revised its guidance lower for q which put further pressure on the shares although it is never great when companies miss and guide lower i believe the underlying reason for orbks q performance and q guidance lower than expected sdd segment revenue has been misinterpreted by market participants leading to an overreaction in the share price unfortunately sdd revenues are typically lumpier and a single customer order delay can meaningfully impact revenue as i see it the company simply faced sdd order delays during the period and is being conservative for q despite these shortterm headwinds i believe the sdd division along with the fpd and pcb segments should accelerate through the second half of  in contrast to my view the market seems to be discounting orbks  growth potential because one segment underperformed for one quarter and that to me represents an opportunity to buy due to the selloff orbk not only has underperformed its peers on a historical basis but is also undervalued on a variety of historical metrics in my analysis i included applied materials nasdaqamat lam research nasdaqlrcx klatencor nasdaqklac nova measuring nasdaqnvmi nanometrics nasdaqnano and teradyne nyseter source ycharts internal model in addition to being undervalued on a historical basis the company also seems to be undervalued relative to its future growth based on my eps and sales targets which are in line with many sellside analysts if orbk traded at peer average pe or ps ratio levels the share price would be meaningfully higher based on the peer average pe  e earnings ratio of x and target earnings of share the stock is trading at a  discount to the fair value price of share risks despite its growth prospects and valuation there remain risks associated with an investment in orbk first should macroeconomic conditions deteriorate causing a decrease in spending by orbks customers my earnings estimates and price target would be negatively impacted second given that orbk operates in a cyclical business should electronics demand weaken or capital investment in china slow it would materially impact orbks stock price additionally orbk has relatively high customer concentration and geographic china and larger asianpacific region concentration risk should one of their major customers reduce spending or a regional macroeconomic event unfold in asia orbk would be negatively impacted finally while i believe orbk has a strong competitive position in the markets it operates in there is always the risk that competition drives prices and margins lower summary as a leading supplier of solutions that are critical in the timetomarket sequence of its technologyfocused customers orbk is ideally positioned to benefit as demand for mainstream products such as smartphones tablets monitors and flat panel tvs increases for the foreseeable future the company has a strong competitive position the firepower to make another strategic acquisition and is undervalued relative to its peers across a variety of metrics i believe an investment in orbk offers an attractive riskreward profile at these price levels following the overreaction of the market to the most recent earnings release disclosure i amwe are long orbk i wrote this article myself and it expresses my
