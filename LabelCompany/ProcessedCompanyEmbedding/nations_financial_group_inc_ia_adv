think hain offers value at x our fy eps estimates which is  below consensus despite slowing apparently underlying top line trends we see value   according to zacks investment research nordstrom’s shares have outperformed the broader industry on a year to date basis as the company has been gaining from its focus on enhancing customer experience and productivity we also commend nordstrom’s strong brand image cost saving initiatives and store expansion efforts further the company’s progress on its  strategy bodes well estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company’s firstquarter results moreover the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in recent quarters however the company’s presence in the consumerdriven apparel space keeps the company exposed to the risks of changing tastes preferences and spending behavior of consumers also stiff competition from other players remains a threat to margins further the seasonal nature of the company’s business may hurt
