main story photo mathew brady in july  after the battle of gettysburg he usually sent other photographers to the civil war front serving as an agent for their work credit mathew bradyus national archives salman rushdie in his novel “the ground beneath her feet”  described what we see in a photograph as “a moral decision taken in oneeighth of a second”in the early days of photography those moral decisions took longer to process when mathew brady the civil warera photographer took a portrait the shutter remained open for  to  seconds or more long enough for a bit of wind or the hint of a smile to ruin everything his subjects often had their heads stabilized by an unseen visebrady  was america’s first great portrait photographer richard avedon and annie leibovitz rolled into one those long exposure times were a gift of sorts to a country that was still young what brady’s images lacked in spontaneity they more than made up for in gravitas he defined a nation’s dignified visual sensibility“mathew brady portraits of a nation” is a new biography from robert wilson the editor of the american scholar it’s a compact straightforward unblinking volume that has some of the attributes of its subjectif i sometimes wanted more expressiveness from it — if i wished it were a literary document as well as an historical one — well you can’t have everything the book is sober history a flinty chunk of americana photo credit patricia wallthe new york times almost no one smiled in brady’s photographs smiles are elusive too hard then to bottle one of the things mr wilson makes plain about brady however is that he himself had a terrific smile in his presence one observer said you felt “the light of an irish shower sun” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story brady’s personal charm helped make him the favorite of presidents generals celebrities and royalty he photographed lincoln grant and lee as well as twain and whitman and dolley madison and daniel webster in the s and s he set up a large gallery in downtown manhattan he was “brady of broadway” advertisement continue reading the main story not a lot is known about his early life brady was raised in upstate new york near lake george his father was an irish immigrant brady made it to manhattan about the time the daguerreotype did he manufactured leather cases for photographic equipment before going into the photography business himself he opened his first studio in anyone who has seen ken burns’s documentary “the civil war” knows how beautifully he learned to pan across brady’s photographs from that war among the first in history to leave a detailed photographic record the details of brady’s war years are both funny and revealing about the agehe accompanied the union army to its first major battle at bull run and the experience scared him to death he’d apparently shown up wearing a white linen duster a straw hat and a gold watch fob “did he have any idea what war was like” mr wilson asks “if so why did he dress for it like a french landscape painter” photo mathew brady just after his return from the battle of bull run in july  none of his images survived the tumult credit matthew brady brady lost his bull run images in the tumult and rarely went near a battlefield again he sent teams of photographers to the war’s fronts instead he ran something like an early version of the magnum agencythere’s been abiding controversy about who actually took many of the photographs attributed to brady mr wilson wades through these issues patiently almost photo by photo he mostly comes to his subject’s defense“the idea that brady stifled his photographers or took undue credit for work that was theirs — undue by the standards of their day not ours — is based on supposition and not evidence and seems wrongheaded” mr wilson comments “brady allowed his photographers not only to freelance for the army while working for him but also to copyright the photographs they took while in his employ”brady’s biggest photographic accomplishment may have been the familiar image he took of the defeated general lee in richmond shortly after the south had surrendered at appomattox “it was supposed that after his defeat it would be preposterous to ask him to sit” brady said later in an interview “i thought that to be the right time for the historic picture”brady was right “who but brady could have pulled off this photographic and journalistic coup” mr wilson asks among the reasons he could do so is that because of his longtime interest in photographing military men he’d known lee since the mexican war photo robert wilson credit cheung ching ming in the photographs the author notes the grizzled lee “summons the strength of his unusual personal dignity for brady’s camera showing no trace of the humiliation of defeat but only a selfpossessed seriousness” he “gave the south a hero to cling to in those dark days after the war and for decades to come” advertisement continue reading the main story brady’s career went slowly downhill after the war there were bankruptcies some said he drank too much even late in life however as his health was failing friends would report things like how “at the sight of me his face lit up with his characteristic winning smile”brady’s early photographs of lincoln had helped imprint the politician on the public mind “brady and the cooper institute made me president” lincoln supposedly said referring to a speech he gave in the great hall at cooper union during the  campaignwhen lincoln received a request for a photograph he responded by writing that while he was in new york “i was taken to one of those places where they get up such things and i suppose they got my shadow and can multiply copies indefinitely”brady understood the history he was helping to make as an advertisement for one of his portrait services once warned accurately if heavyhandedly “you cannot tell how soon it may be too late” mathew brady portraits of a nation by robert wilson illustrated  pages bloomsbury  continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what

in american history best known for his scenes of the civil war he studied under inventor samuel f b morse who pioneered the daguerreotype technique in america brady opened his own studio in new york in  and photographed andrew jackson and john quincy adams among other celebrities when the civil war started his use of a mobile studio and darkroom enabled vivid battlefield photographs that brought home the reality of war to the public thousands of war scenes were captured as well as portraits of generals and politicians on both sides of the conflict though most of these were taken by his assistants rather than by brady himself after the war these pictures went out of fashion and the government did not purchase the mastercopies as he had anticipated brady’s fortunes declined sharply

and became pages student in  the two traveled to albany new york and then to new york city where brady continued to study painting with page and also with pages former teacher samuel f b morse morse had met louis jacques daguerre in france in  and returned to the us to enthusiastically push the new daguerreotype invention of capturing images at first bradys involvement was limited to manufacturing leather cases that held daguerreotypes but soon he became the center of the new york artistic colony that wished to study photography morse opened a studio and offered classes brady was one of the first studentsbetter source needed in  brady opened his own photography studio in new york and by  he began to exhibit his portraits of famous americans including the likes of senator daniel webster and poet edgar allan poe in  he opened a studio in washington dc where he met juliet whom everybody called julia handy whom he married in  and lived with on staten island bradys early images were daguerreotypes and he won many awards for his work in the s ambrotype photography became popular which gave way to the albumen print a paper photograph produced from large glass negatives most commonly used in the american civil war photography in  brady produced the gallery of illustrious americans a portrait collection of prominent contemporary figures the album which featured noteworthy images including the elderly andrew jackson at the hermitage was not financially rewarding but invited increased attention to brady’s work and artistry in  parisian photographer andréadolpheeugène disdéri popularized the carte de visite and these small pictures the size of a visiting card rapidly became a popular novelty thousands were created and sold in the united states and europe in  brady placed an ad in the new york herald offering to produce photographs ambrotypes and daguerreotypes this inventive ad pioneered in the us the use of typeface and fonts that were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements civil war documentationedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may  learn how and when to remove this template message soldier guarding arsenal washington dc  at first the effect of the civil war on bradys business was a brisk increase in sales of cartes de visite to departing soldiers brady readily marketed to parents the idea of capturing their young soldiers images before they might be lost to war by running an ad in the new york daily tribune that warned you cannot tell how soon it may be too late however he was soon taken with the idea of documenting the war itself he first applied to an old friend general winfield scott for permission to travel to the battle sites and eventually he made his application to president lincoln himself lincoln granted permission in  with the proviso that brady finance the project himself his efforts to document the american civil war on a grand scale by bringing his photographic studio onto the battlefields earned brady his place in history despite the dangers financial risk and discouragement by his friends brady was later quoted as saying i had to go a spirit in my feet said go and i went his first popular photographs of the conflict were at the first battle of bull run in which he got so close to the action that he barely avoided capture while most of the time the battle had ceased before pictures were taken brady came under direct fire at the first battle of bull run petersburg and fredericksburg portrait of brady by charles loring elliott  he also employed alexander gardner james gardner timothy h osullivan william pywell george n barnard thomas c roche and seventeen other men each of whom was given a traveling darkroom to go out and photograph scenes from the civil war brady generally stayed in washington dc organizing his assistants and rarely visited battlefields personally however as author roy meredith points out he brady was essentially the director the actual operation of the camera though mechanical is important but the selection of the scene to be photographed is as important if not more so than just snapping the shutter this may have been due at least in part to the fact that bradys eyesight had begun to deteriorate in the s many of the images in brady’s collection are in reality thought to be the work of his assistants brady was criticized for failing to document the work though it is unclear whether it was intentional or due simply to a lack of inclination to document the photographer of a specific image because so much of brady’s photography is missing information it is difficult to know not only who took the picture but also exactly when or where it was taken in october  brady opened an exhibition of photographs from the battle of antietam in his new york gallery titled the dead of antietam many images in this presentation were graphic photographs of corpses a presentation new to america this was the first time that many americans saw the realities of war in photographs as distinct from previous artists impressions mathew brady through his many paid assistants took thousands of photos of american civil war scenes much of the popular understanding of the civil war comes from these photos there are thousands of photos in the us national archives and the library of congress taken by brady and his associates alexander gardner george barnard and timothy osullivan the photographs include lincoln grant and soldiers in camps and battlefields the images provide a pictorial cross reference of american civil war history brady was not able to photograph actual battle scenes as the photographic equipment in those days was still in the infancy of its technical development and required that a subject be still in order for a clear photo to be produced following the conflict a warweary public lost interest in seeing photos of the war and brady’s popularity and practice declined drastically later years and deathedit photograph of brady c  during the war brady spent over  to create over  plates he expected the us government to buy the photographs when the war ended when the government refused to do so he was forced to sell his new york city studio and go into bankruptcy congress granted brady  in  but he remained deeply in debt the public was unwilling to dwell on the gruesomeness of the war after it had ended and so private collectors were scarce depressed by his financial situation and loss of eyesight and devastated by the death of his wife in  he died penniless in the charity ward of presbyterian hospital in new york city on january
