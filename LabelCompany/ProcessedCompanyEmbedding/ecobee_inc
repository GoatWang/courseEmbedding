what customers are saying  amazon reviews  out of  stars  stars best household improvement ever im a new homeowner and not yet secure in my diy skills so i asked my brotherinlaw to help me install it but in truth i could have done it myself i specifically purchased ecobee to work with our amazon echo and so my husband who has md can control the temperature and it is perfect akowonderwoman on august    stars great customer service i love my ecobee we are renters so this was a big undertaking for us to replace the thermostat that came with our apartment with a digital thermostat but our air conditioning bills were getting crazy our thermostat was very unreliable it would randomly go up to  degrees in the middle of the night or other times for no reason and we wanted to be able to control it from outside the home we briefly considered the nest which has some great rebates from our power company but after poring over reviews we decided to go with the ecobee mainly because it was home kit compatible and we may want to use that in the future since we have an apple home network and apple tv amoki on august    stars great for toohotinsummer and toocoldinwinter rooms product is great and arrived fast we needed our babys room to have a sensor as it is always hotter in the summer and colder in the winter as it was a guessing game with the original thermostat downstairs after having  professional hvac people come over and telling us theres nothing we can do with the ducts to improve the situation we compromised for a smart thermostat to at least eliminate the guessing game i would still want to change our hvac configuration but thats a k job bootvi on august    stars im in love with my ecobee im in love with my ecobee upgraded from an old nonprogrammable honeywell thermostat so far my hvac seems to run much less than with the old thermostat i love the programmable schedules and the sensor modules i also installed the unit myself using the power extender kit and it was super easy really looking forward to lower energy consumption and costs with this thermostat bigirishape on august    stars great purchase better than nest in that it has discrete external sensors to focus on rooms you care about the most easy to program schedule set up was overall pretty easy love that i can control the temperature on my cellphone similar to nest it is a goodlooking modern product but with in my opnion a more pleasant display and touchscreen jacquelyn m means on august    stars the functionality and ease of use of this device is amazing im already seeing the energy savings the functionality and ease of use of this device is amazing im already seeing the energy savings the sensor system is simply brilliant and the fact that they have motion detectors is amazing the app is very easy to use and a breeze to setup with apple home i will be purchasing additional sensors to make it even more smarter around my house there is a lot of technology here which is the main reason i choose this over the nest and also a  year warranty y acosta on august    stars best thermostat on the market i really believe this is the best thermostat on the market you can place multiple external sensors around the house so that the ecobee e knows that the temperature is in different parts of the house since the e knows both the temperature in other parts of the house and if someone is present it can dynamically care about the temperature only in rooms that have recently seen occupancy ken s on july   load more reviews smart wifi thermostats by ecobee  ecobeelogo ecobeelogo
