injustice or something that should be brought to public attention through his standuplive recordingsinterviews he well puts across a very good point to these people that dont care dressing up as hitler and following around powerful uk minister telling them how much he likes their politics really leaves you in tears of laughter having a friend who works for a large government organisation that is frequently a target for mark thomas gives even more of an insight that will always draw me back to his show a perfect  out of  keep it up mark  of  people found this review helpful  was this review
