diagram water spectrum dissociation anomalies water properties  water clusters protein hydration hydrocolloids ions  table of contents site map water dissociation and ph a remarkable property of pure water is that it dissociates to form hydrogen ions ho and hydroxide oh ions   the ionic product kw ph variation in kw with temperature and pressure acidity basicity and the pka of water hydrogen ions hydroxide ions grotthuss mechanism                        i will employ the name “hydrogen ion exponent” and                            the symbol ph for the numerical value of the exponent of this power søren sørensen                    the ionic product kw water dissociation autoionization selfionization occurs endothermically d due to electric field fluctuations between neighboring molecules dipole librations  resulting from thermal effects and favorable localized hydrogen bonding  that together with nuclear quantum effects  cause these fluctuations the process may be facilitated by exciting the oh stretch overtone vibration  once formed at an average concentration of about  m hoh···oh h the ions may separate by means of the grotthuss mechanism but normally  rapidly recombine  ps  with a frequency in the terahertz range rarely about once every eleven hours per molecule at  °c or less than once a week at  °c the localized hydrogen bonding arrangement breaks before allowing the separated ions to return  the pair of ions h ohg hydrate independently and continue their separate existencea for about  μs this lifetime also dependent on the extent of hydrogen bonding being shorter at lower temperatures they tend to recombine when separated by only one or two water molecules ho   h  oh kw  hoh   although the extent of dissociation is tiny hho   x  at  °c the dissociation and consequential changes in the tiny concentrations of hydrogen ions have absolute importance to living processes hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are produced already hydrated   ho liq   haq  oh aq   the protons h initially hydrate as hydroxonium ions ho also called oxonium or hydronium ions and do not exist as naked protons in liquid or solid water where they interact extremely strongly with electron clouds all three hydrogen atoms in the hydroxonium ion are held by strong covalent bonds and are equivalent that is cv symmetry in a vacuum the thermodynamic properties of the dissociation at  °c and  mpa are δu°   kj mol δv°   cm mol δh°   kj mol δg°   kj mol δs°   j k mol  the proton is never found unhydrated in aqueous solution and the hydroxonium ions ho also has negligible independent existence in an aqueous environment  all the hydroxonium ion protons are predominantly hydrogen bonded causing further hydration to hohon where n depends on the conditions such as temperature solutes pressure and method of determination   to avoid the misleading presumption of the existence of bare protons similar to other bare cations but see  for an alternative view the above equations are better written as  hoaq   hoaq  ohaq kw  hooh   both ions are ionic kosmotropes hydrating and creating order in forming stronger hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules than the water molecules form between themselves and creating short chains of hydrogen bonded water molecules  remarkably the volume change in this reaction    hoaq   hoaq  ohaq  δv   cm mol   at  °c and infinite dilution  see figure right due to the change in the hydration strength plus electrostriction is about the same as one molecule of water  cm mol when one water molecule ionizes its volume effectively disappears   the concentrations of ho and oh are normally taken as the total concentrations of all the singly charged small clusters including these species as other water molecules are required to promote the hydrolysis the equations below includes the most important none of these hydrated ions should be considered as fixed structures with further water molecules constantly coming and going in aqueous solution with timescales of picoseconds no bare protons occur however    ho   ho  ho  ho   ho  ho   the concentration of hydroxonium and hydroxide ions produced is therefore equal to the square root of the dissociation constant kw   aqueous oh does not ionize further as o  ho oh k   ho does not protonate further to the tetrahedral ho ion as although ho may be metastable in the gas phase it is thermodynamically unstable to loss of a proton  and would immediately dissociate in aqueous solution back to top  ph the hydronium oxonium ion concentration commonly called hydrogen ion concentration is often given in terms of the ph where ph  logho  logho   that is ho  phf with the concentration of ho in mol l more precisely ph  logah  logmhλhm° where ah mh λh and m° are the relative molality based activity molality molal activity coefficient j and standard molality  mol kg of the hydrogen ions at the low concentrations normally found the molaritybased hydrogen ion concentration is close enough to the relative molality based activity for its use in most circumstances the presence of salts and other solutes will generally reduce this activity and the activity varies with temperature the molal activity of hydrogen ions cannot be determined directly but may be determined using a glass electrode relative to the response of standard buffer solutions of comparable ionic strength glass electrodedetermined ph values are errorprone and calculated hydrogen ion concentrations should be treated with caution particularly at the extremes of ph  for more information and a list of primary ph standards see  proof that the use of the equation ph  logh may give misleading results and ph  logah is preferred is easily shown as the ph of  m hcl decreases when it is diluted with  m licl    the ph scale was first introduced by sørensen as ph· in   using colorimetric measurements and the hydrogen electrode which gives an electrode potential proportional to ph ph electrodes are now commonly used to determine the ph see righti the ph scale extends to negative numbers for example concentrated hcl has a ph of about  and to greater than  for example saturated naoh has a ph of about   there is a recent review of the ph of natural water  back   in a similar manner pkw is defined by pkw  logkw  logkw utilizing concentrations in mol l   where the solution contains significant amounts of heavy water do the measured ph will differ slightly from that expected from the amounts of protonated species ho  hdo  hdo  do    back to top  pkw  logkw  iapws variation in kw with t and p kw is very temperature dependent increasing with temperature that is from  ˣ  mol l at  °c ph    ˣ  mol l at  °c ph  to  ˣ  mol l at  °c ph  to  ˣ  mol l at  °c ph   to  mol l at  °c ph   mpa  in agreement with the high positive standard free energy b there is a minimum at about  °c along the saturated pressure line for ho and at about  °c for do see right  the pkw ho minimum is about  lower than that for do  see also conductivity maximum   a theoretical treatment of this temperature dependence is available      temperature and density dependence of dissociation has been examined  dissociation depends on the pressure with kw doubling at about  mpa unsurprising in view of the negative δv associated with the dissociation  cm mol    dissociation also varies with solute concentration and ionic strength for example kw goes through a maximum of about  ˣ  mol l at about  m ionic strength using tetramethylammonium chloride where possibly the change in hydrogen bonding caused by clathrate formation encourages dissociation before dropping to a value of about  ˣ  mol lat  m with higher concentrations disrupting the hydrogen bonding similar maxima occur with other salts such as nacl  m kcl  m kno  m and naclo  m  dissociation will also be different at interfaces for example it is greater at lipid membrane surfaces    in ice where the local hydrogen bonding rarely breaks to separate the constantly forming and reassociating ions the dissociation constant is much lower for example at  °c kw   x  mol l  back to top  acidity basicity and the pka of water there has been controversy and confusion for the last  years over the acidity e of water and its pka a confusion that is yet to be fully clarified does the pka of ho equal   or   the answer depends on the standard state used for the solvent water   the acidity constant ka of weak acid ha d  ha aq ho l a aq  hoaq is defined by ka hoaha pka  logka together with its conjugate base a we get    ha aq  ho l  a aq ho aq         δga°    rt ln ka                a aq ho l  ha aq  oh aq          δgb°   rt ln kb                                                  ho l  ho l  hoaq  oh aq      δgw°   rt ln kw   kj ˣ mol    where the δg° values are the standard gibbs free energies for the equilibria therefore as δgw°  δga°  δgb°  ln kw  ln ka  ln kb and pka pkb  pkw      and      kw  ka ˣ kb   ho as a weak acid may be treated in the same way ho l  ho lhoaq  oh aq its pka has been mistakenly derived as ka hoohho  kwho  kw at  °c and pka  pkw    at  °c however in this derivation the ho is treated both as an acid ho in the denominator equaling about  mol ˣ l and the solvent internalized in the ka definition with a value of unity this disparity in values introduces conflict   the alternative and correct derivation utilizes the activity of water equals unity in the denominator                               ka ho hooh  kw             a number without units                            pka  pkw                              ho  °c   ho is a very weak acid compare pkas of hte hse and hs are   and  respectively the pkb  pkw  pka   related to this ka is for the conjugate base oh not ho as commonly mistakenly cited oh is a strong base whereas ho is a very weak base the pkb of ho is derived exactly as pka above as the equation generates both an acid and a base and gives the same value   at  °c   ho is a strong acid with associated ka ho equaling unity exactly see the equation below pka ho equals zero exactly and is invariant with temperature as δg° is necessarily zero  hoaq  ho l  ho l  hoaq   δg°      rt lnka ho      kj ˣ mol    there is a difficulty that has been ignored in these definitions as ka and kb would normally be expressed in terms of activities rather than concentrations  and the activity of pure ho is defined as unity whereas that of solutes is defined relative to their standard state  mol ˣ kg rather than the concentration of water  mol ˣ l it is important that the value chosen pka   for ho fits in with the known acidity and basicity of water compared with other materials whilst older published materials reported methanol as being more acidic pka   than water  and so mistakenly favoring a pka for water of  a recent reanalysis  shows that water is fold more acidic than methanol a value that fits well with the pka of ho being    this value pka   may be separately determined from thermodynamic δg data  back to top    footnotes a this low occurrence means that at neutrality ph  at  °c c similarly charged ions are on average separated by vast distances  μm in molecular terms and for example bacteria contain only a few tens of free hydrogen ions contributing to this effect are the high dielectric constant encouraging charge separation and high concentration of ho  m increasing the absolute amount dissociated the mean lifetime of a hydroxonium ion  ps about the same as that of a hydrogen bond is such that the charge could be associated with over  molecules of water before neutralization   it follows that pure water droplets containing less than about  water molecules  μm radius would usually ie on average contain no ions in the absence of surface effects back   b a bulk energy diagram for the dissociation in bulk water has been described  back   c note that acidbase neutrality only occurs when the concentration of hydrogen ions equals the concentration of hydroxyl ions whatever the ph this only occurs at ph  in pure water when at  °c a solution is acidic when the hydrogen ion concentration is greater than the hydroxide ion concentration whatever the ph the ph of a neutral solution is numerically equal to half the pkw of the solution therefore a ph of  at  °c indicates a slightly acid solution neutrality is ph  whereas a ph of  at  °c indicates a slightly alkaline solution neutrality is ph  back   d in a vacuum the reaction ho  h  oh requires over three times more energy  mj mol than dissociation ho  h·  ·oh  kj mol in water the hydration of the ions h δg° hydration  kj mol this includes ho δg° hydration  kj mol oh δg° hydration  kj ˣ mol  reduces the δg° of the reaction  ho  ho  oh to  kj ˣ mol these calculations assumes that the standard state of the solvent water is taken as  m if the standard state of the solvent water is unit activity or mole fraction   the δg° is  kj ˣ mol as given above the dissociated radicals h· ·oh are also somewhat stabilized in liquid water as shown by the occasional dissociation of water  see equations back   e note that the acidity of a material is commonly its ph and depends both on its pka and its concentration the acidity of drinks and foodstuffs however also depends on the response of our taste buds back   f as logarithms may only be taken of dimensionless numbers all the concentrations activities partial pressures etc in any logarithmic expression are actually divided by unit values in the same units of that concentration activity partial pressure etc thus for example here ho concentration of of ho in mol l is actually ho mol l   the p in ph originated as the arbitrary choice for the naming of the electrode solutions p and q by sørensen   but is now taken to mean the logarithm to the base  of the reciprocal of cologarithm as in the function described above back   g strictly speaking these equations should be expressed in terms of activities rather than concentrations thus kw  ahaoh the derivations are easier to follow as given and usually the concentrations are so small that the difference is inconsequential back   h similar concentrations are found for ice  back   i different membrane glasses may be used dependent on solution to be analysed eg high temperatures strong alkali or hf   the electrode reaction for the agagclsaturated kcl reference electrode is agcl  e ag  cl                e   v in saturated kcl back   j the activity coefficient of hydrogen ions depends on the acid concentration temperature ionic strength the dielectric constant the size of the ions and the density of the medium back   k the ph of a weak monoprotic acid of concentration c is so long as cka  kw back     home  site index  the
