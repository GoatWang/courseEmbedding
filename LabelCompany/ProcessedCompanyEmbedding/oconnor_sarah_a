usa to compete in the international natural body building federation inbf world titles and returned home to australia with the overall figure amateur world title  sarah  plans her first wnbf pro figure competition in the usa in  the success sarah has achieved in both fitness modelling and figure events is no doubt attributed to her years in the industry she has launched her own website offering personal training plans to help others reach their personal health and fitness goals  back sarah says… i grew up in the barossa valley south australia  i was sports house captain through high school and played a number of sports including basketball netball athletics swimming and beach volley ball  after high school i moved to the gold coast and gained my bachelors degree in exercise science  over the years i have worked as a personal trainer exercise physiologist flight attendant and medical sales rep i decided to turn my passion into what i do all the time  i launched my website offering clients around the world online personal training and nutrition plans  week challenges and accountability programs for all fitness levels  i have a real passion to help as many people i can achieve their health fitness and wellbeing goals when did your journey into health and fitness begin and was there anyone who inspired you to get involved in the industry i was at a sales conference for work in port douglas where trevor hendy was the guest speaker  he told us to write down one thing that we always wanted to achieve in life  i wrote down that i would like to compete in a fitness competition  that marked the start of my competing career  back you have won a number of sports model and fitness model titles across various organisations can you list some of your achievements and any of the highlights of your competition career to date in  i set myself the goal of becoming a pro figure athlete  in  i entered  sportsfitness model competitions placing in all  and finishing the

you feel that fitness modelling events have opened the door to more competitors who otherwise would not or could not compete as a figure competitor yes definitely  i think the fitness model division is a lot more ‘achievable’ for people starting out and also provides a great foundation for those with a future goal of becoming a figure competitor  back with the introduction of fitness models rounds at the qld anb asia pacific do you think that this has provided additional opportunities otherwise not available in the past yes the new fitness model category is a great division  it provides a division for athletes who like to lean down further than what is required for sports model or bikini but do not want to be as muscular as a figure competitor or body builder   i especially liked this division as it suited my body type  it also provided a great stepping stone to advance into future  i also think the fitness model round is great from the spectators’ point of view as it generally showcases the athletic and healthy look to which they aspire what’s the fitness scene like in your home town of adelaide there always seems to be a good number of competitors from sa… adelaide is starting to embrace the fitness lifestyle and is producing some fantastic athletes  the adelaide people really get behind the federations with the numbers of competitors growing every year there is a fine line between conditioning of a figure athlete and a fitness model  do you think this is controlled more through dietary means or training although weight lifting is imperative for building your underlying muscle and symmetry the conditioning required for competing as a figure athlete is largely based on your eating plan  i do not believe in crash dieting  my advice is to make it a priority to find an experienced nutritionist to tailor the right eating plan for you and your body type  what works for me may not work for you  back let’s talk about your exercise program  how many days a week do you workout with weights and how much cardio work during competition season i train one muscle group per day five days a week with an occasional full body circuit on the six day  i have one complete day of rest per week and complete high intensity interval sprints  days per week leading up to a competition it takes a strong mindset to hit the gym and stick to a clean diet plan  how do you keep on track week after week leading up to a comp first of all i lock in my competitions for the year and set myself monthly and weekly targets  i keep myself on target with visualisation  to give you an example last year i found a photo of the athlete who won the world title which i had set my sights on  i put a picture of her standing on stage on my laptop screensaver  each and every morning i opened my laptop and visualised myself standing on that stage with that trophy  and imagined the feeling of achieving my goal  back i am a big believer that… goals are dreams with a ‘due by’ date what this means is dream big set your ‘due by’ date  however make sure you set weekly targets to keep you on track to your end goal and finally visualise yourself daily achieving your dream motivation or lack thereof is often a stumbling block for most people… what is your biggest motivator and what advice can you offer to others from a young age i have a really deep need to be the best i can be at everything i do  this keeps me motivated every day  my advice is to focus on yourself  don’t worry about what everyone else is doing  just put everything into doing your best at what point does exercising go from a positive lifestyle to an obsession and how can we prevent this i think that when you are finding that your rest days are the hardest days of the week you are could be flirting with obsession and over training  rest and recovery is just as important as diet and training  to help prevent an exercising obsession i make sure rest days are scheduled into every weekly training plan i write  back if you could only do three exercises what would they be in order of importance legs back and interval sprints do you prefer to split your routine and if so what is your current split my weight training split is shoulders back legs chest and abs biceps and triceps what sort of cardio and how long would you spend per session on average i find high intensity interval sprints are the most effective way to lean down  i generally do mins natural bodz vol  issue     sarah is now known by her maiden name sarah o’connor you are currently visiting sarah’s website

the answer at  stats loss of kg and cm my pants were tight before the challenge  back i’ve always been fairly active and had a relatively healthy diet or so i thought after having children  singleton and twins i had stacked on some weight so decided to go to weight watchers  i lost weight and then at the age of  i signed up for my first fun run and took up jogging things were going along quite well – up until i got sick and was diagnosed with glandular fever  because i had glandular fever for over  months my liver began to fail and i was constantly fatigued and felt like i had the flu all the time  worst of all i stacked on all the weight that i had lost plus a little bit more  i tried to keep exercising but i had no energy – so it was a vicious cycle over weight and not exercising… not my problem a friend started to deal with an online personal trainer so i decided to give him a go  unfortunately after  months i had only lost a little weight and i felt like i was just wasting my money  i think he was used to dealing with overweight people who didn’t exercise  this wasn’t my problem and he offered little advice to help i noticed a friend of mine – debbie block – had made some amazing transformations  she looked amazing and i wondered what she had been doing  i also thought there was no way i could do what she was doing – she was so toned and muscular – i was too old and unfit to even try it right i wasn’t interested in competing but i really wanted to lose weight and tone up but my curiosity got the better of me so i asked her what she had been doing and she told me that she had an eating and exercise plan from sarah o’connor  i wasn’t interested in competing but i really wanted to lose weight and tone up – and i wondered if sarah could help me  debbie assured me that sarah could help – so i sent an email to find out sarah organized a time to call me – i told her all about my past what had happened to my liver my nonexistent metabolism and how frustrated i was – because all of a sudden i’d gone from being fit and slim – to a lumpy tired and defeated person who felt like the battle with my weight and health was a uphill climb i signed up… one day before my birthday and two weeks before christmas and new years sarah said she would help so i signed up for the  week challenge  i was apprehensive because it was the th of december one day before my birthday and two weeks before christmas and new years but i did it anyway – and it was the best decision of my life the first four weeks were pretty tough – i had cravings and a lot of bad habits to eliminate and eating  meals a day was a real challenge  to lose weight you have to eat lettuce all day right  no sarah told me to trust her and the process so i did i noticed that the measurements were going down… i chose my birthday as my first cheat meal christmas day for another and new year’s for another and it was more than  hours  my weight fluctuated and i didn’t lose much at all – but i noticed that the measurements were going down  i was finally toning up – and losing weight in areas that i’d never been able to lose it before – arms thighs and glutes preparing my food  days in advance has saved me time and money  there is no chance of me grabbing junk food anymore because my food is ready to go i started to lose weight… slowly but surely with lots of guidance and encouragement from sarah i started to lose weight – and the last  weeks i lost weight every week – and best of all i lost lots of centimetres  my pants were looser i didn’t have to jump up and down to get my pants over my hips – i was getting results  other people were starting to notice and commenting on how good i was looking i feel great best of all i feel great – the great food has made my insides feel clean the intake of  litres of water has improved my complexion i still like to have my cheat meal – but don’t feel deprived the other days of the week  and i’m finding that making the healthier choice is so much easier because i actually prefer the taste i am  years old and i think i’ve finally found the secret to success  i am confident that i will reach my goal weight – but i have learnt that it’s not about the scales any more – it’s more about how i feel and how i look … this system does work for anyone who is serious about making a change in their life for the better – this system does work  there are no pills or potions – it’s all about eating the right food at the right time and incorporating some exercise and weights to help tone it’s not easy – but it’s something that is achievable and can be maintained for the rest of my life and my life will be longer because i am fuelling my body with goodness thank you sarah there aren’t enough words to describe how much i appreciate what you have done for me   teena white  back × changes for bonnie  back new zealandbased client bonnie ridley was  weeks into a program with me when she sent through this message hey sarah i really wanted to say thank you for all your help… particularly how reassuring and understanding you have been also thank you for the time you took explaining the reasoning behind certain things i am eating and why i should the effects on my body and also your help with the training i should do it means a lot all the help you have given me since being with you over the last  months is crazy and it truly has helped me get back on my feet after my last comp i really did spiral out of control i hit such a low point due to a combination of injury meaning i could not train and then relationship factors i took it all out on myself through food i had such a negative outlook on food that ranged from secret eating and binge eating to not eating at all to be honest part of me never thought i could get back into shape again  i got really bad anxiety over the way i looked  i was even too embarrassed to go to the gym anymore because i was worried people would make fun of the weight i had put on… which sounds so silly when i write it down i put my original start up photo next to my  week update photo and i can’t believe how much has changed i’m embarrassed i ever got to the first photo but so motivated to see what i was able to achieve and get my body looking like in  weeks thanks to your help so excited to see what we can bring to stage your nutrition and training plan and guidance has helped so much more than you probably realise not just physically but mentally so thank you so much for helping me become comfortable in my own skin again realising i am capable of bigger and better things and restoring my relationship with food and nutrition i have so much admiration and respect for you thanks again xx bonnie  back × belinda says it all  back i first started with sarah about  months ago i found out about her through social media i got in contact with her and straight away i found her to be such a lovely person we talked about goals   we talked about goals and what i was aiming for i signed up for a  week challenge to lose some weight and tone up with sarah’s help i started training and went on a nutrition plan  as the  weeks went by i received emails every week from her… some had expert info about nutrition or training and others were an accountability survey the expert info was awesome  it gave that personal touch and also helped to explain and teach methods for training eating and your overall well being each week i sent back the survey and within a couple of days sarah would be in touch answering any questions i had and giving words of encouragement to help keep me motivated and on the right track knowing sarah believed in me made all the difference  back even though some weeks it was hard to know that she was there and believed in me made all the difference at the end of the  weeks i wasn’t where i wanted to be so i spoke with sarah  i was so happy with all the help she had already given me i decided to continue with her for an  week challenge  i had a pretty good reason to give it my all in the upcoming  weeks as it took me right up until my wedding day it took me right up to my wedding day   having a serious goal in mind made a big difference  all sarah wanted for me on my wedding day was to look my best similar to the  week challenge i received an accountability survey every week  it really helped me to keep on track and i was able to let sarah know how i was feeling and where i was up to in the whole process every time i felt like i was struggling or felt down sarah was there to remind me of how good i could feel and look on my wedding day she was right the hard work was worth it   when i look back at the photos i can see the hard work that went into those  weeks with all the ups and downs  it was worth it i felt beautiful and all i wanted to do was send sarah a pic so she could see that we made it after the wedding we stayed in contact  i was starting to get so used to the training and nutrition that i wanted to keep going i wanted a new goal sarah and i talked again and we decided that i would compete in season a  prep began in january sarah tailored programs for me   being a part of teamoc is one of the best and most amazing experiences i have had and i will be forever grateful for having sarah behind me through the prep i am from a very small country town  it has a second hand gym with old weight machines and limited equipment i went through with sarah what was available to me and she was able to tailor programs for me in detail  if there was ever anything i was not able to do with the limited equipment i had available i would let sarah know and she would give me an alternative straight away comp day was awesome  back when it was comp day i was competing on my own but sarah was there by the phone the whole time throughout the whole day we kept in contact  after each class i went out in i would talk to her straight away send photos and have her coach me as the day went on it was so awesome i could not be happier with what sarah has provided for me i have learnt so much from her  to have started with the challenges and then become a part of teamoc has been so rewarding  i feel so lucky to not only call sarah my coach but one of my beautiful friends we have been able to build an awesome relationship and without all her help with training knowledge and nutrition i would not be where i am today i have found a love of life passion and happiness and i could not be more grateful to sarah belinda muller   belinda says “i could not be happier with what sarah provided…”  back × dannis lifestyle change  back i’ve always enjoyed going to the gym i love lifting weights and i’m addicted to that feeling you get after smashing a great cardio session my food plan that’s tailored exactly to my fussy eating is amazing i really enjoy eating food from it instead of eating it because it’s healthy and i want results or because i have to  it’s a real lifestyle change in saying this you cannot reach your goals until you believe you can achieve them having you there to support encourage guide and motivate me through these  weeks has been a blessing and i couldn’t have done this without you it’s such a mind game but seeing these changes has motivated me to keep going through the silly season and strive towards achieving my goals thank you xx danni biar​  back × from rhys  competitor  back some time back i set myself a  week goal to get up on stage at the inba queensland titles in australia  i achieved it but in no way was this an easy task  no partying so many nights in food prep  hours of training a day water loading and depletion  so much you need to go through but… i enjoyed the process … loved it i have so much respect for athletes that compete in the fitness and bodybuilding industry now more then ever  the dedication and the drive you need to achieve this goal has to be intense or you will fail during the  weeks comp prep my coaches sarah o’connor and grant pieterse stuck with me and pushed me through to what i look like today i found out  weeks into it that i was gluten and lactose intolerant and had to change my whole diet and start from scratch  i am

as posting me her theme wear to borrow sarah was always there for me all hours of the day or night  she always gave me positive energy that would always lift my spirit if i was doubting myself or

last time i competed and it was so refreshing to know that sarah valued this part of the journey so highly and was so helpful and supportive with her coaching sarah provides weekly expert advice and online progress surveys frequent telephone calls and is available   she was also comp prepping at the same time and never put her own clients second she has become somebody i look up to and would call

competing since competing i feel like i walk taller am stronger mentally emotionally and physically am more confident make better choices food and nonfood related and am all round happier anyone can

were always so thorough and extremely helpful  a critical component of the service she provides  these are great the smaller things – like the weekly count down emails – were also a nice touch in the personalised service  the youtube motivation videos where also an a resource  it helped me to source my own motivational videos as well  i would regularly listen to them at work with a head set on just to zone out  back × courtney sums it up  back i was recommended to sarah by a friend in the gym who had previously competed using sarah’s comp prep  i have always dreamed of competing and finally threw away doubts and fears and signed up with sarah after chatting to her throughout prep i had many questions for sarah  i even doubted her advice sometimes but i always listened and she always explained why we took certain approaches  everything always made sense and she always put my health first even being online and having sarah prepping for the competition worked too sarah was always so supportive i love all my meals and loved the training program  it changed every few weeks and was individualised to my needs  sarah was honest at each check in and helped me focus on my goal towards

tetramer and takes pyruvate the product of glycolysis and converts it to lactate as well as converts it to lactate as well as converting nadh to nad   the ldha gene was previously amplified using pcr and isolated from the pet plasmid from e coli  the ldha gene was eventually ligated with e coli t dna ligase this ligation product of the ldha gene was chemically transformed to make them competent cells the plasmid was purified and restriction analysis was used to determine the identity of the plasmid agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine the success of the ldhpet digest from another group’s colonies since most of the class had no colonies after transformation the protein sequences of the human and chicken ldha gene were aligned and compared with a percent matrix of  and the ldha gene in e coli underwent screening expression to determine what induction conditions best express the ldh protein introduction lactate dehydrogenase ldh is found in nearly all cells and is a tetramer ldh has  isoforms that are all homotetramers and heterotetramers that differ in subunit composition in which the number of muscle m subunit encoded by ldha gene and heart h subunit encoded by ldhb gene vary ldh takes pyruvate the final product of glycolysis and converts it to lactate and takes nadh and converts it to nad   and is considered a reversible reaction augoff to purify lactate dehydrogenase or any protein purification is performed at optimal ph low temperature °c minimum time and minimized exposure to proteases o’connor  before transformation the ldha gene was amplified using pcr polymerase chain reaction which produces multiple copies of the particular dna fragment using a template dna sequence two oglionucleotide primers flanking this sequence a thermostable dna polymerase and dntps deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphates garibyan the ldha gene was then cut out using restriction enzymes which are produced by bacteria and recognize specific sequences in dsdna doublestranded dna and cleave at or near the site berg the ldha gene was then ligated using t dna ligase which forms two covalent phosphodiester bonds between the ’ oh ends of one nucleotide with the ’ p end of another nucleotide the two separate dna molecules collide with each other and stick and the t dna ligase seals the dna molecules together with atp wilson the ligation reaction of the ldha gene undergoes the process of transformation transformation is a process used by bacteria to acquire new genetic material by the direct uptake of foreign dna by competent cells chemical transformation involves cacl  treatment for e coli  a polyethylene glycol peginduced transformation of the bacterial protoplasts and a brief heat pulse at °c the cacl  allows for the dna to this preview has
