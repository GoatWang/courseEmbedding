pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

alcohol dependency was pioneered by dr david sinclair using the principles of harm reduction and symptomdriven treatment currently nalmefene is formulated as an oral tablet for alcohol dependency in

blocks dopamine transporters which increases the amount of dopamine in the brain and increases activation of the reward circuitry chronic cocaine use has also been shown to increase in the number of opioid receptors expressed in the reward circuitry when opioids activate opioid receptors they initiate a dopamine release which activates the reward circuitry opioid antagonists can help to manage

pharmaceuticals  opioid overdose reversal  investorrelationsopiantcom opioid overdose reversal about opioid overdose the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reports that in the us there is one opioid overdose death every  minutes and every day  people are treated in emergency departments for using painkillers in a manner other than as directed the difference between an effective and fatal opioid dosage can be small and unpredictable both patients who are prescribed opioids and subjects who abuse opioids are at risk for overdose this is because in addition to mediating pain relief opioids reduce the rate of respiration during an opioid overdose the most prevalent hazard from the significant increase in activation of opioid receptors is respiratory depression which can lead to respiratory arrest and death currently injectable naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdose but is only effective if administered in time opioid antagonists can prevent and reverse overdose through binding to opioid receptors in the brain and thus prevent exogenous opioids such as heroin or opioid painkillers from activating these opioid receptors in collaboration with its commercial partner adapt pharma opiant has developed a naloxone nasal spray a treatment for opioid overdoses and alternative to injection treatments narcan® naloxone hcl nasal spray has fda approval for commercial use

naltrexone hydrochloride naltrexone in development for the treatment of alcohol use disorder aud this study was conducted under a clinical trial agreement between opiant and the national institute of

development   some notable phase  findings include   ·intravail® recently licensed by opiant from aegis therapeutics increased the maximal plasma concentrations cmax of in naltrexone by almost

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the
