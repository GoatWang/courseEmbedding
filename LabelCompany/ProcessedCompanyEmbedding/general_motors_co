the united motors corporation as an amalgamation of parts suppliers supplying gm and other oems but independent of gm alfred p sloan head of the newly acquired hyatt roller bearing corporation became united motors ceo united motors acquired delco and kettering began his association with sloan united motors also acquired at this time the original remy corporation called the remy electric company a competitor of delco in  general motors bought united motors various entities grew out of the original delco and remy including the dayton metal products corporation the general motors research corporation the delco division and remy electric division of gm delco remy now remy international inc acdelco delco electronics and others todays main successor corporation is delphi automotive which nowadays is an independent parent corporationcitation needed the general motors research corporation at dayton under kettering became a true automotive research center during the next few decades it led the development of many electricalappliance features for cars and trucks in  charles f kettering with henry m leland of dayton engineering laboratories company delco invented and filed us patent  for the first electric starter in america in  cadillac introduced the first massproduced production v in the world in  general motors patented the use of tetraethyllead as an antiknock agent leading to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency in  jominy  boegehold of gm invented the jominy endquench test for hardenability of carbon steel a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as astm a in  gm introduced the worlds first automatic transmission the hydramatic for the  oldsmobile and would be adopted by the auto industry later in  gm introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the oldsmobile cutlass turbojetfire in  the lunar rover a partnership between gms delco defense electronics division and boeing traversed the surface of the moon in  gm produced the first rear wheel antilock brake system in the world for two of their cars the toronado and eldorado in  robert lee of gm invented the fendb permanent magnet fabricated by rapid solidification dichlorodifluoromethane refrigerant for hvac and refrigeration applications freon r recognized today as a bad idea environmentally being a chlorofluorocarbon cfc but a technological wonder of its day commercially practical twostroke diesel engines better transmissions for tracklaying vehicles many other advancements although gm rd as it is known in colloquial shorthand began as an organization largely built around one man kettering it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them world war ii was a turning point wherein military affairs after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some  years first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them civilian life too changed in this direction by the s corporations such as gm and many others were facing a new era of rd different from earlier ones less about genius inventors and individual inventions and more about organizational progress and integrated systems it raised new questions about where the capital for rd would come from in an era of limitless demand for rd although not necessarily for production alfred sloan longtime ceo of gm s to s discussed in his memoir also considered a seminal management treatise the relationships between government academia and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science in light of this new era the views he laid out reflected and influenced wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to todaycitation needed today gm rd headquartered in warren michigan is a network of six laboratories six science offices and collaborative relationships in over twelve countries including working relationships with universities government groups suppliers and other partners from across the globecitation needed on september   at the intelligent transport systems world congress in detroit gm disclosed it would be introducing autopilot features into certain  models of its cars which would go on sale in  the super cruise or vehicletovehicle vv technology is likely to be first

to develop selfdriving cars that could be used in ridesharing fleets small car salesedit chevrolet aveo concept later went into production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economycar and smallcar policies should be the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision although gm since the s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as  and  they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the s and s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choicescitation needed since the return of high fuel prices in the s and s gms interest in truly smallcar programs for the us market has been renewed as part of general motors company development gm revived one of its idled us factories for the production of a small car in orion michigan with the creation of  american jobs this will be the first time ever that a large manufacturer produces a supermini vehicle in the united states this retooled plant will be capable of building  cars annually including both

general motors spanish zaragoza manufacturing plant in fall  the zaragoza solar installation has about  square feet  m of roof at the plant and contains about  solar panels the installation was created owned and operated by veolia environment and clairvoyant energy who lease the rooftop area from general motors in  general motors also invested  million in solarpanel provider sunlogics which will install solar panels on gm facilities gm has long worked on alternativetechnology vehicles and has led the industry with ethanolburning flexiblefuel vehicles that can run on either e ethanol or gasoline the company was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of v engines in the s but quickly lost interest as muscle car popularity increased they demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene an area of interest throughout the industry but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the  oil crisis in the s and s gm pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the cadillac v variablecylinder engines in  gm in conjunction with aerovironment built the sunraycer which won the inaugural world solar challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology much of the technology from sunraycer found its way into the impact prototype electric vehicle also built by aerovironment and was the predecessor to the general motors ev gm supported a compromise version of the corporate average fuel economy cafe standard

suspension unsafe at any speed by ralph nader published in  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant

national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you can see general motors that naders criticisms were valid journalist david e davis in a  article in automobile magazine noted that despite naders claim

salesedit chevrolet aveo concept later went into production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economycar and smallcar policies should be the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision although gm since the s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as  and  they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the s and s temporarily shielded them from any downside to

published in  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you

economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision although gm since the s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at

slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of

salesedit chevrolet aveo concept later went into production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economycar and smallcar policies should be the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that

decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to

published in  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you can see general motors that naders criticisms were valid journalist david e davis in a  article in automobile magazine noted that despite naders claim that swingaxle rear suspension were dangerous porsche mercedesbenz and volkswagen all used similar swingaxle concepts during that era defective ignition system investigationedit main article general motors ignition switch scandal in may  the nhtsa fined the company  million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade despite knowing there was a problem with the switches general motors paid compensation for  deaths linked to the faulty switches the  million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose general motors has announced that they are also facing  customer lawsuits asking for as much as  billion for economic losses attributed to the recall as well as the cobalts the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars such as the pontiac g the saturn ion the chevrolet hhr the

twostroke diesel engines better transmissions for tracklaying vehicles many other advancements although gm rd as it is known in colloquial shorthand began as an organization largely built around one man kettering it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them world war ii was a turning point wherein military

salesedit chevrolet aveo concept later went into production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economycar and smallcar policies should be the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision although gm since the s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as  and  they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the s and s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choicescitation needed since the return of high fuel prices in the s and s gms interest in truly smallcar programs for the us market has been renewed as part of general motors company

published in  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you can see general motors that naders criticisms were valid journalist david e davis in a  article in automobile magazine noted that despite naders claim that swingaxle rear suspension were dangerous porsche mercedesbenz and volkswagen all used similar swingaxle concepts during that era defective ignition system investigationedit main article general motors ignition switch scandal in may  the nhtsa fined the company  million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade despite knowing there was a problem with the switches general motors paid compensation for  deaths linked to the faulty switches the  million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose general motors has announced that they are also facing  customer lawsuits asking for as much as  billion for economic losses attributed to the recall as well as the cobalts the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars such as the pontiac g the saturn ion the chevrolet hhr the

the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision although gm since the s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as  and  they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the s and s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choicescitation needed since the return of high fuel prices in the s and s gms interest in truly smallcar programs for the us market has been renewed as part of general motors company development gm revived one of its idled us factories for the production of a small car in orion michigan with the creation of  american jobs this will be the first time ever that a large manufacturer

alternativetechnology vehicles and has led the industry with ethanolburning flexiblefuel vehicles that can run on either e ethanol or gasoline the company was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of v engines in the s but quickly lost interest as muscle car popularity increased they demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene an area of interest throughout the industry but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the  oil crisis in the s and s gm pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the cadillac v variablecylinder engines in  gm in conjunction with aerovironment built the sunraycer which won the inaugural world solar challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology much of the technology from sunraycer found its way into the impact prototype electric vehicle also built by aerovironment and

published in  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you can see general motors that naders criticisms were valid journalist david e davis in a  article in automobile magazine noted that despite naders claim that swingaxle rear suspension were dangerous porsche mercedesbenz and volkswagen all used similar swingaxle concepts during that era defective ignition system investigationedit main article general motors ignition switch scandal in may  the nhtsa fined the company  million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade despite knowing there was a problem with the switches general motors paid compensation for  deaths linked to the faulty switches the  million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose general motors has announced that they are also facing  customer lawsuits asking for as much as  billion for economic losses attributed to the recall as well as the cobalts the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars such as the pontiac g the saturn ion the chevrolet hhr the

the chevrolet monte carlo were also used gm has won a total of  nascar sprint cup series manufacturers championships including  with chevrolet the most of any make in nascar history  with oldsmobile  with buick and  with pontiac gm leads all other automobile manufacturers in races won in nascars premier series at  chevrolet leads individual makes with  wins in australia there is the v supercar

these cars have a top speed of  kmh  mph and run – kmh in  seconds the holden racing team is australias most successful team in australian touring car history in  and  the drivers championship was won by the very closely linked now defunct hsv dealer team research and developmentedit see also general motors technical center and general motors proving grounds research and development rd at general motors began organically as the continuation of such rd as the various divisions eg cadillac buick olds oakland were already doing for themselves before the merger its character was entirely empirical it was whatever key people in each company had been competent enough to organize and pursue r s mclaughlins carriage company in  was designing and inventing carriage gear the mclaughlin companies became general motors of canada limited charles f ketterings dayton engineering laboratories company delco at dayton ohio was still an independent firm at this time its work was well known to gm central management through its relationship as a supplier and consultancy to cadillac and buickcitation needed in  durant organized the united motors corporation as an amalgamation of parts suppliers supplying gm and other oems but independent of gm alfred p sloan head of the newly acquired hyatt roller bearing corporation became united motors ceo united motors acquired delco and kettering began his association with sloan united motors also acquired at this time the original remy corporation called the remy electric company a competitor of delco in  general motors bought united motors various entities grew out of the original delco and remy including the dayton metal products corporation the general motors research corporation the delco division and remy electric division of gm delco remy now remy international inc acdelco delco electronics and others todays main successor corporation is delphi automotive which nowadays is an independent parent corporationcitation needed the general motors research corporation at dayton under kettering became a true automotive research center during the next few decades it led the development of many electricalappliance features for cars and trucks in  charles f kettering with henry m leland of dayton engineering laboratories company delco invented and filed us patent  for the first electric starter in america in  cadillac introduced the first massproduced production v in the world in  general motors patented the use of tetraethyllead as an antiknock agent leading to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency in  jominy  boegehold of gm invented the jominy endquench test for hardenability of carbon steel a breakthrough in heat treating still in use today as astm a in  gm introduced the worlds first automatic transmission the hydramatic for the  oldsmobile and would be adopted by the auto industry later in  gm introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the oldsmobile cutlass turbojetfire in  the lunar rover a partnership between gms delco defense electronics division and boeing traversed the surface of the moon in  gm produced the first rear wheel antilock brake system in the world for two of their cars the toronado and eldorado in  robert lee of gm invented the fendb permanent magnet fabricated by rapid solidification dichlorodifluoromethane refrigerant for hvac and refrigeration applications freon r recognized today as a bad idea environmentally being a chlorofluorocarbon cfc but a technological wonder of its day commercially practical twostroke diesel engines better transmissions for tracklaying vehicles many other advancements although gm rd as it is known in colloquial shorthand began as an organization largely built around one man kettering it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them world war ii was a turning point wherein military affairs after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some  years first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them civilian life too changed in this direction by the s corporations such as gm and many others were facing a new era of rd different from earlier ones less about genius inventors and individual inventions and more about organizational progress and integrated systems it raised new questions about where the capital for rd would come from in an era of limitless demand for rd although not necessarily for production alfred sloan longtime ceo of gm s to s discussed in his memoir also considered a seminal management treatise the relationships between government academia and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science in light of this new era the views he laid out reflected and influenced wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to todaycitation needed today gm rd headquartered in warren michigan is a network of six laboratories six science offices and collaborative relationships in over twelve countries including working relationships with universities government groups suppliers and other partners from across the globecitation needed on september   at the intelligent transport systems world congress in detroit gm disclosed it would be introducing autopilot features into certain  models of its cars which would go on sale in  the super cruise or vehicletovehicle vv technology is likely to be first introduced to the cadillac range enabling drivers to switch in and out of semiautomated mode in december  general motors announced it would begin testing selfdriving vehicles on public roads in michigan after gov rick snyder signed a package of bills legalizing the operation of autonomous vehicles in march  general motors bought cruise automation a san francisco selfdriving vehicle startup to develop selfdriving cars that could be used in ridesharing fleets small car salesedit chevrolet aveo concept later went into production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economycar and smallcar policies should be the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision although gm since the s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as  and  they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the s and s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choicescitation needed since the return of high fuel prices in the s and s gms interest in truly smallcar programs for the us market has been renewed as part of general motors company development gm revived one of its idled us factories for the production of a small car in orion michigan with the creation of  american jobs this will be the first time ever that a large manufacturer produces a supermini vehicle in the united states this retooled plant will be capable of building  cars annually including both small and compact vehicles production started in late  with the

energy who lease the rooftop area from general motors in  general motors also invested  million in solarpanel provider sunlogics which will install solar panels on gm facilities gm has long worked on alternativetechnology vehicles and has led the industry with ethanolburning flexiblefuel vehicles that can run on either e ethanol or gasoline the company was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of v engines in the s but quickly lost interest as muscle car popularity increased they demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene an area of interest throughout the industry but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the  oil crisis in the s and s gm pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the cadillac v variablecylinder engines in  gm in conjunction with aerovironment built the sunraycer which won the inaugural world solar challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology much of the technology from sunraycer found its way into the impact prototype electric vehicle also built by aerovironment and

published in  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you

salesedit chevrolet aveo concept later went into production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economycar and smallcar policies should be the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision although gm since the s has always offered economy models in the us market relative to that markets definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as  and  they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the s and s temporarily shielded them from any downside to

published in  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rearengined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first – models that had a swingaxle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the costcutting lack of a front stabilizer bar antiroll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturers recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold  psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer in early march  several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for  naders lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the proconsumer center for study of responsive law a  safety commission report conducted by texas am university concluded that the – corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations the us department of transportation dot issued a press release in  describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in  studying the handling of the  corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine—along with a secondgeneration corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the page report reviewed nhtsas extremecondition handling tests national crashinvolvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvairs handling nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the – corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests  the handling and stability performance of the – corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you

economycar and smallcar policies should be the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the th century between policies for the us market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the us was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the us did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the us the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in nonus markets than in the us and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing gms acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk  and adam opel ag germany  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that

decade and had done research and development in the s and s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the us market it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the us market in the s through s gms response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasingdecision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some us consumers flocked temporarily to
