inspection is a structured process of trying to find defects in development documents such as programming code specifications designs and others during various phases of the software development process it is named after michael fagan who is credited with being the inventor of formal software inspections fagan inspection defines a process as a certain activity with a prespecified entry and exit criteria in every activity or operation for which entry and exit criteria are specified fagan inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process fagan inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process software testing portal contents  examples  usage  criteria  defects  typical operations  followup  roles  benefits and results  improvements  example  references examplesedit examples of activities for which fagan inspection can be used are requirement specification softwareinformation system architecture for example dya programming for example for iterations in xp or dsdm software testing for example when creating test scripts usageedit the software development process is a typical application of fagan inspection software development process is a series of operations which will deliver a certain end product and consists of operations like requirements definition design coding up to testing and maintenance as the costs to remedy a defect are up to  times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phasecitation needed it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible this is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements or exitcriteria of that operation criteriaedit entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process for example for fagan inspections the high and lowlevel documents must comply with specific entrycriteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process for example for fagan inspections the lowlevel document must comply with specific exitcriteria as specified in the highlevel document before the development process can be taken to the next phase the exitcriteria are specified in a highlevel document which is then used as the standard to compare the operation result lowlevel document to during the inspections deviations of the lowlevel document from the requirements specified in the highlevel document are called defects and can be categorized in major defects and minor defects defectsedit according to me fagan “a defect is an instance in which a requirement is not satisfied” in the process of software inspection the defects which are found are categorized in two categories major and minor defects often many more categories are used the defects which are statements or declarations that are incorrect or even missing information can be classified as major defects the software will not function correctly when these defects are not being solved in contrast to major defects minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software but are mostly small errors like spelling mistakes in documents or optical issues like incorrect positioning of controls in a program interface typical operationsedit in a typical fagan inspection the inspection process consists of the following operations planning preparation of materials arranging of participants arranging of meeting place overview group education of participants on the materials under review assignment of roles preparation the participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects the participants prepare their roles inspection meeting actual finding of defect rework rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author designer or programmer on the basis of the list of defects the lowlevel document is corrected until the requirements in the highlevel document are met followup in the followup phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected as they have been fixed in the rework phase the moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case he should verify if all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects it is crucial that all defects are corrected as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project will be  to  times higher compared to the current costs fagan inspection basic model followupedit in the followup phase of a fagan inspection defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified the moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified such as when the defect was trivial in nontrivial cases a full reinspection is performed by the inspection team not only the moderator if verification fails go back to the rework process rolesedit the participants of the inspection process are normally just members of the team that is performing the project the participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process authordesignercoder the person who wrote the lowlevel document reader paraphrases the document reviewers reviews the document from a testing standpoint moderator responsible for the inspection session functions as a coach benefits and resultsedit by using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease creating a higher quality product in the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight in the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence by continuously improving the inspection process these insights can even further be used fagan  together with the qualitative benefits mentioned above major cost improvements can be reached as the avoidance and earlier detection of errors will reduce the amount of resources needed for debugging in later phases of the project in practice very positive results have been reported by large corporations like ibm indicating that  of defects can be found and savings in resources up to  can be reached fagan  improvementsedit although the fagan inspection method has been proved to be very effective improvements have been suggested by multiple researchers genuchten for example has been researching the usage of an electronic meeting system ems to improve the productivity of the

highlevel document with a single requirement as can be seen in the highlevel document for this project is specified that in all software code produced variables should be declared ‘strong typed’ on

process of trying to find defects in development documents such as programming code specifications designs and others during various phases of the software development process it is named after michael fagan who is credited with being the inventor of formal software inspections fagan inspection defines a process as a certain activity with a prespecified entry and exit criteria in every activity or operation for which entry and exit criteria are specified fagan inspections can be used to validate if the output of the process complies with the exit criteria specified for the process fagan inspection uses a group review method to evaluate the output of a given process software testing portal contents  examples  usage  criteria  defects  typical operations  followup  roles

for example dya programming for example for iterations in xp or dsdm software testing for example when creating test scripts usageedit the software development process is a typical application of fagan inspection software development process is a series of operations which will deliver a certain end product and consists of operations like requirements definition design coding up to testing and maintenance as the costs to remedy a defect are up to  times less in the early operations compared to fixing a defect in the maintenance phasecitation needed it is essential to find defects as close to the point of insertion as possible this is done by inspecting the output of each operation and comparing that to the output requirements or exitcriteria of that operation criteriaedit entry criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to enter a specific process for example for fagan inspections the high and lowlevel documents must comply with specific entrycriteria before they can be used for a formal inspection process exit criteria are the criteria or requirements which must be met to complete a specific process for example for fagan inspections the lowlevel document must comply with specific exitcriteria as specified in the highlevel document before the development process can be taken to the next phase the exitcriteria are specified in a highlevel document which is then used as the standard to compare the operation result lowlevel document to during the inspections deviations of the lowlevel document from the requirements specified in the highlevel document are called defects and can be categorized in major defects and minor defects defectsedit according to me fagan “a defect is an instance in which a requirement is not satisfied” in the process of software inspection the defects which are found are categorized in two categories major and minor defects often many more categories are used the defects which are statements or declarations that are incorrect or even missing information can be classified as major defects the software will not function correctly when these defects are not being solved in contrast to major defects minor defects do not threaten the correct functioning of the software but are mostly small errors like spelling mistakes in documents or optical issues like incorrect positioning of controls in a program interface typical operationsedit in a typical fagan inspection the inspection process consists of the following operations planning preparation of materials arranging of participants arranging of meeting place overview group education of participants on the materials under review assignment of roles preparation the participants review the item to be inspected and supporting material to prepare for the meeting noting any questions or possible defects the participants prepare their roles inspection meeting actual finding of defect rework rework is the step in software inspection in which the defects found during the inspection meeting are resolved by the author designer or programmer on the basis of the list of defects the lowlevel document is corrected until the requirements in the highlevel document are met followup in the followup phase of software inspections all defects found in the inspection meeting should be corrected as they have been fixed in the rework phase the moderator is responsible for verifying that this is indeed the case he should verify if all defects are fixed and no new defects are inserted while trying to fix the initial defects it is crucial that all defects are corrected as the costs of fixing them in a later phase of the project will be  to  times higher compared to the current costs fagan inspection basic model followupedit in the followup phase of a fagan inspection defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified the moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework sometimes fixed work can be accepted without being verified such as when the defect was trivial in nontrivial cases a full reinspection is performed by the inspection team not only the moderator if verification fails go back to the rework process rolesedit the participants of the inspection process are normally just members of the team that is performing the project the participants fulfill different roles within the inspection process authordesignercoder the person who

resultsedit by using inspections the number of errors in the final product can significantly decrease creating a higher quality product in the future the team will even be able to avoid errors as the inspection sessions give them insight in the most frequently made errors in both design and coding providing avoidance of error at the root of their occurrence by continuously improving the inspection
