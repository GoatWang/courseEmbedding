positive cash flow of  into the company during the period the company needs to raise additional capital to fund our development stage company activities and to position the company for a market launch of its planned products and services to generate revenue before the existing capital resources are fully utilized in the event that the company runs out of available working capital resources or experiences an unforeseen impact to cash flow our company will need to rely upon the issuance of common stock and additional capital contributions from shareholders andor loans from shareholders and thirdparty lenders to meet its working capital needs offbalance sheet arrangements none critical accounting policies the financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements going concern the companys consolidated financial statements are presented on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the six month reporting period ended june   the company reported a net loss from operations of  with a net increase in cash from operating investing and financing activities of  during the same period since inception to june   the company reported a net loss from operations of  certain conditions noted below raise doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern as a development stage company the companys ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to secure additional debt or equity financing managements plan is to secure additional working capital funds through future debt or equity financings the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage here is
