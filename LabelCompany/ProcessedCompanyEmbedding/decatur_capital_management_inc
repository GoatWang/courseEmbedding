decatur capital management  early years home early years dcm team philosophy strategies advisory council dcm research contact us flame of knowledge decatur capital management formerly cornerstone asset management is an employeeowned secregistered investment advisory firm the firm was founded by degas a wright cfa and ralph j bryant cpa and began operations in  the genesis for the firm actually began several years earlier while serving as treasurer for the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority marta and a member of marta’s pension committee degas was curious about drivers of the market as many of the investment managers he met with could not provide satisfactory answers to his questions he began in earnest to research the market after several years and many late nights degas developed an investment thesis however without any direct investment industry experience it was not clear how he could he start an investment firm at the same time ralph was managing an accounting practice ralph had worked with degas at a consulting firm in the early ’s and ralph and degas had developed a friendship over the years naturally degas turned to ralph for advice on establishing a business degas and ralph soon realized that with their combined skills expanding ralph’s accounting practice into asset management was a logical step by building upon the success of ralph’s accounting practice degas could now launch the asset management firm that he had envisioned degas’s and ralph’s first office space was  square feet with two small offices in a walkup two story condominium office building thus in june  with zero assets under management and at the height of the technology bubble cornerstone asset management began operations ralph deftly managed the firm’s finances while degas worked on the investment thesis and developed the firm’s quantitative approach to evaluating a firm’s fundamental ratios and potential for stock price appreciation the term ‘lean’ is far too generous to describe the early years based on their unwavering faith though ralph and degas eked out an existence from accounting assignments and consulting work then the tech bubble popped at the time degas was convinced that the firm’s quantitative approach would work even in a declining market he shared with several prospects the firm’s investment approach in march  decatur capital management began managing its first institutional client since that first institutional client the firm went through a name change and moved its offices in  the firm was starting to get calls from consultants who were interested in the firm’s strong investment performance the problem was that the consultants would often ask whether or not the firm was affiliated with some other ‘cornerstone’ capital the partners soon discovered that there were  plus other ‘cornerstone’ sec registered investment advisory firms across the us as it is difficult enough to stand out in the industry the firm did not need to confuse consultants and potential clients with a common name the principals researched various names and based on the advice of a trusted friend of the firm decided on decatur capital after all decatur is where the principals raised their families it is home the firm registered decatur capital management with the sec in january  looking back ralph degas and decatur capital have been mentored and guided by many friends and supporters in the industry they are truly grateful for the unselfish assistance they have received over the years they believe they have an obligation to pass on this generosity

philosophy strategies advisory council dcm research contact us we quantify the fundamentals core philosophy all of our investment strategies rest on a common philosophy that portfolio outperformance is generated by transforming both proprietary and academic research into investment strategies that adapt to everchanging capital markets creating an initial buy list through proprietary multifactor models integrating sophisticated quantitative research with careful fundamental analysis ultimately we believe that disciplined investing drives portfolio alpha process more so than growth investors we prefer to characterize our style as earningscycle investors our investment process is designed to identify companies displaying aboveaverage and sustainable earnings momentum based on inhouse and academic research we believe that eps estimate revisions and eps surprises relative to consensus estimates are among the most unbiased âsignaling devicesâ in equity markets our process begins by identifying promising stocks within the investment universe through proprietary multifactor econometric models our models have been developed to in essence quantify the fundamentals along with other key attributes we search for firms with positive eps estimate revisions accelerating eps momentum and consistent eps surprises this first stage allows us to identify the best earnings growth stories in the relevant universe the next step of the process focuses on the fundamentals our sector leaders perform rigorous analysis of financial statements with a primary focus on the balance sheet and cash flow statement this careful analysis attempts to gauge whether the company possesses a reasonable debtcapitalization profile an efficient working capital management strategy improving cashoncash returns and a rational cash flow utilization we also stress test the strength of debt coverage ratios and analyze debt repayment schedules to avoid refinancing crunches and liquidity mismatches finally we check for accounting integrity by crosschecking operating cf with reported eps to ascertain whether accounting earnings are consistent with cash generation the last step of the process is portfolio constructionour portfolios tend to be fairly sector neutral with the over or underweighting of sectors driven by a set of proprietary multifactor models that are similar to those used to select stocks for the initial buy list risk control is also a key element of portfolio construction we closely monitor the key elements of our portfolios such as tracking error market cap distribution and growthvalue traits from start to finish the overall process stresses discipline however we do not believe that disciplined investing means stagnant investing good investors stick to their knitting but also recognize that the markets do change with the assistance of our academic advisory board we are constantly evaluating the efficacy of our quantitative models our fundamental analysis and our portfolio construction techniques our clients can rest assured though that as our techniques and analysis may evolve as the markets change any change in our process is done in a disciplined manner
