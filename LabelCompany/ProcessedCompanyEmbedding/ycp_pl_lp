any applications the lack of mercury and lead in their manufacturing along with the long life and energy savings make them the best option for the environment though they many have a higher initial

dimmer switch led lighting technology  light emitting diodes led technology was discovered in the early s but did not become a viable product until the late s in the early days they were mainly used as indicator lights because of their long life and reliability but they did not have a high light output for other lighting applications while the led technology was being used in items such as tv remotes and other items as time passed it seemed to have languished in obscurity until the s the adoption of more stringent efficiency laws in europe first and then the united states gave a big boost in rd dollars spent for the technology many of the problems such a lumens light output per watt quality of the light output and high cost of production were overcome with the infusion of money below are some advantages and concerns you should evaluate when choosing whether to buy led lighting products led advantages long life leds long life is one of the major advantages of the technology  early led lights had a median life ratings of  hours but this has come down in most retail products as the manufactures have increased the light output lumens per watt  the higher light output per watt causes heat in the diode that produces the light which has shortened the life  this being said most of the retail led products out today are rated in the  to  hour range to put this long life in perspective a  hour rated led light bulb that burns for  hours a day will last for an average of  years this can be a huge advantage if your lighting application is in a difficult place to change and maintenance is an issue energy efficiency  energy efficiency has become a big topic in todays society and has been the main driver in the development of leds the us government put new energy efficiency regulations into place in  and again in  that required lighting to meet new efficiency standards it also outlawed the manufacturing and import of many of the traditional incandescent and halogen bulb you may have used in the past led bulbs meet these new regulations and provide one of the most efficient light sources you can buy below is an example of efficiency and life  watt led light bulb          watt compact fluorescent light bulb  watt incandescent light bulb energy usage   watts energy usage   watts energy usage   watts lumens   lumens   lumens   lumens per watt  6  lumens per watt   lumens per watt   average life   hours average life   hours average life   hours the other important thing to remember about efficiency is that led technology is still improving every year where as the other two types are close to there limits in technological advancement  leds have been advancing at a rapid pace both in efficiency and cost light quality   there are a two main ways that the industry measures light quality color temperature and color rendering index cri color temperature is a term that manufactures use to measure the color of the light the color temperature of lights is measured in kelvin an incandescent light bulb has a kelvin of  where a halogen light bulb is around  kelvin the lower kelvin colors are termed as warm colors yellower white and the higher kelvin numbers are termed as cool colors bluer white it is important to remember that you are measuring shades of white when discussing kelvin leds like compact fluorescent come in many kelvin options which can include k k k and k temperatures these options allow you to find the color of light that works for your specific applications color rendering index cri measures how true the colors look under the light bulb an incandescent light bulb is rated as a  cri and is the standard that all other lighting is measured fluorescent lights usually rate at a cri of  to  the newer led light start at  and have now gone up into the lower s in some cases the best way to think of cri is the closer the number is to  the truer the colors will look there is one other advantage that leds have when it comes to light quality they have virtually no uv or infrared light in their output uv and ir are the elements of light waves that fade fabrics paint and other items leds have very little uv and ir components which make ideal for use with art work and fabrics led concerns pricing pricing for leds started very high but they have been coming down every year at their prices today they are very economical due to their high energy efficiency and long life pricing will continue to go down in the future and efficiency will continue to increase making leds more and more viable option light output the other concern with leds is the amount of total light lumens that they put out leds while very efficient in lumens per watt are still not able to match the light output of some of the higher wattage light bulbs that are now outlawed every year the industry continues to improve this leds can meet the needs of most applications today but if you require a lot of light lumens for your application it may have to wait for the led technology to catch up philips light bulbs   flat rate shipping on all usa orders  case discounts shop with confidence     shopping cart items  subtotal
