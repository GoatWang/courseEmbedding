the direction of the economy david tillson july    it seems as though everyone from the “manonthestreet” to the world’s central bankers cannot agree on where we stand in terms of the outlook for the economy one week’s good news is often offset by the next week’s bad news the continual release of seemingly contradictory economic data keeps everyone a little off balance while statistics are necessary when analyzing the economy it is well known that data revisions false signals and surprises are the norm david laidlaw april   status quo in the macro economy v rapid change everywhere else david laidlaw april   the recovery from the financial crisis of  has been marked by two extraordinary characteristics the first is that economic growth in the us and throughout the world has been extremely slow gross domestic product has not grown at a rate above  during any year and has averaged  since the recession ended in the second quarter of  the second characteristic is that the recovery has lasted a very long time david tillson january   do expectations live up to reality david tillson january   the one constant in life is change sometimes we can anticipate an impending change and be fairly certain of the result as in “it’s going to rain tomorrow” other times change happens when we least expect it and with an uncertain outcome—remember december th  over the ages when the brits spoke “the king is dead long live the king” it was a recognition that change is normal but that life must go on and people must adapt despite everything that has occurred  was a year of some major changes and some very surprising unexpected results  david tillson october   low interest rates market manipulation fraud and politics david tillson october   we chose these topics for discussion because low interest rates have led to accusations of market manipulation by central bankers and to fraudulent behavior by issuers of some bonds a few comments about politics are warranted because it is ‘the season’ the world has been living with low interest rates for nearly a decade and confidence that we will return to a ’s type of interest rate environment any time soon is certainly lacking some economists and market strategists are questioning if central bankers have been experimenting with financial markets too much with too little to show for it  david laidlaw september   money market changes david laidlaw september   the brokerage firms and banks are implementing new sec rules affecting money market accounts  we have reviewed the options and will change client money market accounts to the cashbank balance choice since we believe it is the safest option for liquid funds   david laidlaw july   brexit  a deeper dive david laidlaw july   our plans to discuss other topics in this quarterly note were upstaged by the uk’s recent vote to leave the european union eu the ‘brexit’ vote caught many including us off guard the subsequent economic impacts still remain unclear thus the immediate ‘risk off’ move in stocks was logical more surprising was the ensuing rally in which  of postbrexit equity market losses were recouped in a matter of  hours david laidlaw april   should i stay or should i go david laidlaw april   it is a challenging environment for investing and current macroeconomic and financial market conditions have pushed many investors toward supposedly safer investments past efforts by monetary authorities around the world to increase economic growth have been relatively unsuccessful as worldwide growth is now well below desired levels this lack of growth combined with the battle against recessions has led central banks to adopt unconventional and untested tools investors are nervous that politicians and bankers have exhausted their remedies to restore normalcy   david tillson january    fourth quarter commentary david tillson january   this quarter’s letter was initially designed to take a slightly somber tone of “ was a little rocky but not too much damage was done”  however given the inauspicious start to  a different focus is clearly in order  just to put  to bed the market depending on your definition was essentially flat  the russell  and sp  indexes were up approximately  while their growth and value constituents showed plus  and negative  returns respectively  major bond indices were in these same ranges which had the practical effect of most major investment strategies having similar performance   david tillson eagle ridge investment management llc profile  biography  bloomberg feedback david tillson
