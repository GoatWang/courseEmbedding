a cubic foot of hydrogen weighs just  ounce an atom of hydrogen consists of only one proton and one electron hydrogen is also the most plentiful element in the universe despite its simplicity and abundance hydrogen doesnt occur naturally as a gas on the earth  it is always combined with other elements water for example is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen ho hydrogen is also found in many organic compounds notably the hydrocarbons that make up many of our fuels such as gasoline natural gas methanol and propane hydrogen can be separated from hydrocarbons through the application of heat  a process known as reforming currently most hydrogen is made this way from natural gas an electrical current can also be used to separate water into its components of oxygen and hydrogen this process is known as electrolysis some algae and bacteria using sunlight as their energy source even give off hydrogen under certain conditions hydrogen is high in energy yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution nasa has used liquid hydrogen since the s to propel the space shuttle and other rockets into orbit hydrogen fuel cells power the shuttles electrical systems producing a clean byproduct  pure water which the crew drinks hydrogen has number of applications from chemical processing petroleum recovery and refining metal production and fabrication aerospace and fuel cells the sectors with the greatest demand for hydrogen are petroleum refineries for hydrocracking and ammonia production for fertilizer transportation fuel is an emerging sector with enormous potential in the future market size hydrogen production is a large and growing industry market size of global hydrogen production was estimated to be  million metric tons in  of which  was shared by merchant hydrogen and rest with captive production with decreasing sulfur level in petroleum products lowering crude oil quality and rising demand of hydrogen operated fuel cell applications global hydrogen production volume is forecasted to grow by compound annual growth rate of  form  to  the hydrogen production market in terms of value was estimated to be approximately  billion in  production of hydrogen and delivery hydrogen is either produced centrally or onsite onsite generation also known as distributed generation eliminates number of problems associated with transportation and delivery and thus the market for onsite generation systems is growing significantly also in recent years small scale onsite generation option has become more lucrative since new onsite hydrogen generation technologies offering low cost when compared to delivered merchant hydrogen when hydrogen is produced using a centralized plant it has to be delivered to the point of consumption by various delivery modes such as pipeline trucks or cylinders for large quantities pipelines are the preferred option although pipeline delivery is cheaper in the long term than packaged options like trucks and cylinders it can only be economically justified when the quantity is sufficiently high pipelines require significant initial investment and extremely high volume to pay out over the long term on the other hand cylinders are used for small quantities and preferred by industries such as glass manufacturing metal production and fabrication food processing and electronics the asia and oceania region is the largest market with  of global production share in  this region generated around  million metric tons of hydrogen in  the asia and oceania region pioneered in refinery and ammonia production capacity and this makes it the largest consumer europe and eurasia is the second largest producer followed by north america the third largest region north america is the largest market for merchant hydrogen with  of global merchant hydrogen production in  by country the us is the largest merchant producer with  of global merchant hydrogen production share china is the largest consumer with  of global hydrogen consumption share chinas greatest demand comes from ammonia producers and it is the worlds largest producer and accounted for  of worldwide ammonia production in  presently most of the hydrogen for industrial purposes is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane this production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas the third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal in  an estimated  million metric tons of hydrogen was produced using steam methane reforming smr production costs vary according to size of production plant type of plant utilization factor feedstock cost transportation and delivery hydrogen and fuel cells a fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity heat and water fuel cells are often compared to batteries both convert the energy produced by a chemical reaction into usable electric power however the fuel cell will produce electricity as long as fuel hydrogen is supplied fuel cells are a promising technology for use as a source of heat and electricity for buildings and as an electrical power source for electric motors to propel vehicles fuel cells operate best on pure hydrogen but natural gas methanol or even gasoline can be reformed to produce the hydrogen required for fuel cells some fuel cells can even be fueled directly with methanol without using a reformer in the future hydrogen could also join electricity as an important energy carrier an energy carrier moves and delivers energy in a usable form to consumers renewable energy sources like the sun and wind cant produce energy all the time but they can for example produce electric energy and hydrogen which can be stored until its needed hydrogen can also be transported like electricity to locations where it is needed fuel cells are a viable option for many uses today and have been adopted by industries that need reliable clean fuel sources for example forklifts operate indoors where combustion engines would require expensive ventilation systems instead of building a fleet of battery powered forklifts which require perhaps two or three extra batteries for every forklift in operation major companies such as walmart and cocacola are choosing equipment powered by hydrogen fuel cells which refuel in minutes and run at full power for eight hours similarly hydrogen fuel cells are already being used in cities around the world to power public transportation buses market for renewable hydrogen environmental concerns  co mitigation the increasing demand for hydrogen for heavy oil upgrading desulfurization and upgrading of conventional petroleum and for production of ammonium in addition to the projected demand for hydrogen as a transportation fuel and portable power will require hydrogen production on a massive scale increased production of hydrogen by current technologies will consume greater amounts of conventional hydrocarbons primarily natural gas which in turn will generate greater greenhouse gas emissions production of hydrogen from renewable sources offers the possibility to contribute to the production capacity with lower or no net greenhouse gas emissions without carbon sequestration technologies increasing the flexibility and improving the economics of distributed and semicentralized systems decentralized production renewable hydrogen systems can be adapted to onsite decentralized production of hydrogen circumventing the need to establish a large and costly distribution infrastructure renewable hydrogen production offers the potential for a distributed hydrogen supply network model which would be based on onsite hydrogen production onsite production is considered by many to be the most likely pathway during the market development of energy systems a distributed network of such sites could provide a costeffective refueling infrastructure as hydrogen must be used as close as possible to its production site to optimize the overall energy efficiency of a hydrogenbased energy system remote communities  islands there are socioeconomic benefits as well as technical reasons for developing renewable hydrogen systems in remote communities the need for improved energy security protection against fluctuating andor high fuel costs and abundant renewable energy resources are key drivers behind these projects in addition the need for clean air reduced noise and community development are also good reasons hydrogen systems can offer jobs tourism and engender community pride the cost of conventional fuel and the restrictions on conventional uses of renewable resources make hydrogen more attractive distributed generation is becoming an increasingly popular approach to providing local power and although each individual system is generally small the number of islands or remote communities that could benefit from renewable hydrogen systems total represents a significant market opportunity a number of communities are already under way working to create renewable hydrogen

technology breakthrough nanotechnology for making renewable hydrogen from sunlight hydrogen h is the most abundant element and cleanest fuel in the universe unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil coal and natural gas where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water ho as the byproduct unfortunately pure hydrogen does not exist naturally on earth and therefore must be manufactured historically the cost of manufacturing renewable hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it this is the dilemma of the hydrogen economy and one that hypersolar aims to address for over a century splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis has been well known theoretically this technology can be used to produce an unlimited amount of clean and renewable hydrogen fuel to power a carbonfree world however in practice current commercial electrolysis technologies require a expensive electricity and b highly purified water to prevent fouling of system components we believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of renewable hydrogen the perfect and sustainable energy cycle as it turns out mother nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules ho into its basic elements  hydrogen and oxygen this is exactly what plant leaves do every day using photosynthesis since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant we cant simply grow trees to make hydrogen if technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen then a truly sustainable low cost and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the earth for millenniums however cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision water splitting in the process of splitting a water molecule input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds of the resulting hydrogen molecule so in essence manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or batterylike storage of the input energy if the input energy is from fossil fuels such as oil and gas then dirty carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen if the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen while the concept of water splitting is very appealing the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable energy inefficiency — since hydrogen is an energy carrier the most energy it can store is  of the input energy however conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components wires and electrodes that only a fraction the solar electricity actually makes it into the hydrogen molecules this translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production hypersolar is addressing this problem with its low cost and energy efficient technology need for clean water —conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components this prevents current technology from using the large quantities of free water from oceans rivers industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock hypersolars technology is designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen breakthrough nanotechnology electrolysis watersplitting in its simplest form is the transfer of input electrons in the following chemical reactions cathode reduction  ho  e  h   oh anode oxidation      oh  o   ho   e from these equations it is easy to see that if every input electron e is put to work and not lost then a maximum amount of input electrons ie energy is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules h additionally if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split every single water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available to address this fundamental electron transfer efficiency problem hypersolar is developing a novel nanoparticle to maximally ensure that every single electron is put to work in splitting a water molecule our nanoparticle has two very important features selfcontained photoelectrochemical nanosystem — our low cost nanosize particle technology is designed to mimic photosynthesis and contains a solar absorber that generates electrons from sunlight as well as integrated cathode and anode areas to readily split water and transfer those electrons to the molecular bonds of hydrogen unlike solar panels or wind turbines that produce a sizeable number of electrons that will be lost before reaching the hydrogen bonds our nanoparticles are optimized at the nanolevel to ensure maximal electron generation and utilization efficiency consequently our nanoparticle technology uses substantially fewer photovoltaic elements an expensive material than conventional solar panels to achieve the same system level efficiency thereby significantly lowering the system cost of what is essentially an electrolysis process protective coating — the biggest problem with submerging photovoltaic elements in water for direct electrolysis is corrosion and short circuiting to address this problem we have developed a protective coating that encapsulates key elements of the nanoparticle to allow it to function for a long periods of time in a wide range of water conditions without corrosion this allows the nanoparticles to be submerged or dissolved into virtually any source of water such as sea water runoff water river water or waste water instead of purified distilled water by managing the science of electrolysis at the nanolevel we believe that our nanoparticle technology can deliver unmatched cost reductions to enable the commercial production of renewable hydrogen from any sources of water with sunlight as the only source of energy our nanoparticle technology is a next generation solution however during the process of developing this technology we have achieved a number of discrete technology breakthroughs that have allowed us to develop a commercial solution for todays renewable hydrogen market see hypersolar hgenerator

renewable hydrogen production hydrogen in water has an amazing energy storage density we estimate that only  liters of water is required to store enough solar energy in renewable hydrogen to power a typical american home consuming kwhday of electricity when hydrogen is used in a fuel cell for electricity production water is produced and can be easily recycled for reuse therefore the actual consumption of water for renewable hydrogen production is quite low one of the most significant challenges in using hydrogen is transporting it to the point of use long haul transportation of hydrogen by trucks or pipeline remains technically and economically challenging however by enabling the low cost production of renewable hydrogen wherever there is water and sunlight we can facilitate a

accordingly x renewable power plants conventional solar and wind electricity are intermittent when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing solar panels and wind turbines from renewable power plants are not producing electricity as a result these renewable power plants are not reliable enough to be a standalone utility scale power plant while conventional electrolysis technology can technically be used to store solar or wind electricity as hydrogen it is very cost prohibitive because of the inherent systemlevel energy losses otherwise electrolysis would be the current standard storage technology for solar and wind power by implementing the hypersolar hgenerator on a utility scale large farms of low cost reactor vessels can be employed to convert large areas of solar energy

the world as the demand for personal and mass transit grows with an increasing population electric power vehicles do not have any tailpipe emissions and have been praised as the solution to the worlds transportation needs however current battery based electric vehicles suffer from two big problems  long charging time and  plugin electricity is from a fossil fuel power plant that burns coal or natural gas with a renewable hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicle charging time could be as fast as a regular gasoline fillup and the only byproduct of hydrogen fuel usage is water it is only with renewable hydrogen that the electric vehicle visions can be realized at a large scale a growing list of automakers such as audi bwm toyota and honda are all developing hydrogen fuel cell cars selfcontained hydrogen fueling stations one of the biggest problems with the hydrogen car vision is the lack of hydrogen fueling stations and the cost to build such an infrastructure is enormous however by using the hypersolar hgenerator standalone fueling stations can build and operated one by one along any highway where there is water and sunlight during the day solar energy can be stored

wellpositioned to capture silicon panel market as new study predicts cpv sector growth lowconcentration layer redefines concentrated photovoltaic cpv sector march    pm eastern daylight time santa barbara califbusiness wirehypersolar inc otcbb hysr the developer of a breakthrough technology that magnifies the power of the sun to significantly increase the power output of solar cells today announced that following a new industry report predicting elevated growth of the cpv sector the company expects its technology to redefine and expand the boundaries of conventional cpv with a product that captures the silicon solar panel market “this report confirms that concentrating sunlight onto a pv cell is gaining in popularity as a viable solar solution” said tim young ceo hypersolar inc “but to really drive this idea home and bring the cost per watt of solar energy down to prices equal to conventional electricity the market needs a product that uses concentration techniques in mainstream applications – such as conventional flat silicon panels this is exactly what hypersolar offers” the “cpv technology market status update and future prospects” report by strategy analytics concluded the cpv sector is expected to grow by  per cent through  to account for four percent of the global solar supply it was presented last week at solartech world  in gwangju korea the report also highlighted the intrinsic barrier the sector faces due to the fact that most cpv technologies require direct sunlight mr young added “hypersolar’s innovative new cpv approach does not require direct sunlight nor does it require bulky optical elements or failureprone tracking devices as do other cpv technologies” the hypersolar layer takes the form of an acrylic “top sheet” that allows a solar cell to produce as much as  percent more power by adding the concentrator manufacturers can use significantly fewer solar cells thus dramatically reducing cost about hypersolar inc hypersolar is developing a breakthrough technology that magnifies the power of the sun to significantly increase the power output of solar cells using innovative photonics and lowcost manufacturing processes hypersolar is developing the worlds first thin and flat solar concentrator for standard solar cells applied on top of solar cells the lowcost hypersolar concentrator can increase solar cell power

funding after an ipo there are limited ways to get funding traditional loans for a risky company are virtually nil so the common instruments involve convertible debentures and for hysr convertible notes hysr sells the notes to lenders who at note maturity get warrants or basically the rights up to an infinite number of shares to sell to get their loan back plus one boocoo big profit if you look at the k listed above look at pages f and f including the derivative liabilities and read the terms on each of the notes that hysr has going now see that the note holders can and do sell their shares at a heavily discounted share price they do so until the terms of the contract are satisfied the notes payback is a very dilutive thing and thus the number of outstanding shares os goes up and share value goes down when you are buying shares that are being sold by note holders you are buying a debt that hysr by contract has to pay off shares that are just traded by shareholders are not debt and have no effect on the company check out online convertible notes as that is the financing instrument most commonly used also try to learn of the great dangers that can happen from them hope this helps

hgenerator™ hgenerator – eliminates the need for an electrolyzer todays standard system for producing solar generated hydrogen consists of a solar cell array connected to an electrolyzer an electrolyzer is an electrolysis device that uses electricity to split distilled water into hydrogen and oxygen commercially available electrolyzers are very energy intensive and expensive hypersolar is developing and intends to market a novel solar hydrogen generator that eliminates the expensive electrolyzer by integrating the electrolysis function directly into a solar cell hgenerator cell the key to the direct integration of a solar cell and electrolysis is our proprietary patentpending polymer coating that performs two very important functions  conductively glues catalyst material directly on to a conventional solar cell and  protects the solar cell from corrosion when submerged in an electrolytic solution the result is a standalone selfcontained solar hydrogen generator – the hgenerator cell hgenerator panel hgenerator cells will be arranged as a matrix in a flat panel reactor filled with an electrolytic solution hgenerator system hgenerator panels can be connected together to scale to any size system to meet application specific hydrogen requirements the hgenerator system will contain a process control unit that automates the liquid chemical processes as well as hydrogen removal from the hgenerator panels into a temporary storage tank two primary configurations of the hgenerator system are planned including  low pressure – hydrogen produced by the hgenerator panels are at atmospheric pressure  bar and will be pumped into a buffer tank for immediate off take by downstream system components  elevated pressure – hydrogen produced by the hgenerator panels will be processed through a pressure booster a gas dryer and a purifier that produces high purity hydrogen at an elevated pressure for direct charging of metal hydride hydrogen storage tanks or further compression for high pressure gas tanks distributed and scalable the hypersolar hgenerator will be designed to be a linearly scalable and selfcontained renewable hydrogen production system as a result it is intended to be installed almost anywhere to produce hydrogen fuel for local use this distributed model of hydrogen production will address one of the greatest challenges of using clean hydrogen fuel on a large scale – the need to transport hydrogen in large quantities each stage of the hypersolar hgenerator can be scaled independently according to the hydrogen demands and length of storage required for a specific application a small scale system can be used to produce continuous renewable electricity for a small house or a large scale system can be used to produce hydrogen to power a community the hgenerator technology is currently under development we are in the process of designing a demonstration unit hysr stock price  hypersolar inc stock quote us otc  marketwatch

prototype jul   otc disclosure  news service  santa barbara calif july   globe newswire  hypersolar inc otcqbhysr the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water today announced it has completed its largest prototype to date a one square foot unit that is capable of producing hydrogen in a completely renewable process a video of the prototype and process can be found here the prototype was completed with the key objective of demonstrating how the technology can be scaled up while remaining highly productive a key challenge in maintaining the hydrogen production efficiency in a scaledup device is managing the increased solution transport losses from one side of the cell to the other hypersolar uses its patentpending process that substantially reduces the solution transport losses thereby maintaining the efficiencies of hydrogen production in a large solar cellsbased device  as the company continues to increase the size of its working prototype it can effectively showcase to future partners and customers its potential for real world application such as a hydrogen fueling station or in the warehouse of a big box retailer the latter of which has become more commonplace in american business as evidenced by ongoing hydrogen fuel technology implementation at ecommerce titans walmart and amazon the prototype was completed at the university of iowa campus the site of its growing scientific team led by cto dr joun lee and university of iowa professor dr syed mubeen  “with this demonstration and further improvements in stability and efficiency through innovations in catalyst integration technology we believe our prototypes can soon be commercially viable” said dr joun lee hypersolar chief technologist   demand for hydrogen has increased significantly in the last three years with fuel cell vehicles and power equipment coming to market from large auto manufacturers like honda and toyota and fuel cell makers like plug power to date however over  of hydrogen produced still uses a method utilizing natural gas a fossil fuel hypersolar’s process is completely green and sustainable and can be deployed off grid  “the demonstration of this working prototype represents a significant milestone in hypersolar’s quest to produce completely renewable hydrogen at or near the point of distribution” said tim young ceo of hypersolar “we have executed on the key objective of successfully scaling our technology and safely producing increased volumes of renewable hydrogen by establishing our ability to grow in size without reducing efficiency we will turn our attention to incorporating processes and materials that will also reduce cost if successful we believe the potential for identifying partners to support bringing the technology to scale as well as eventual commercialization will continue to become more realistic” hypersolar’s primary research is focused on developing a completely renewable lowcost and submersible hydrogen production particle that can split water molecules using the power of the sun emulating the core functions of photosynthesis each particle is a complete hydrogen generator that contains a novel high voltage solar cell bonded to chemical catalysts by a proprietary encapsulation coating a video detailing the rise of hydrogen fuel

information investor faq news about company team contact technology breakthrough nanotechnology for making renewable hydrogen from sunlight hydrogen h is the most abundant element and cleanest fuel in the universe unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil coal and natural gas where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water ho as the byproduct unfortunately pure hydrogen does not exist naturally on earth and therefore must be manufactured historically the cost of manufacturing renewable hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it this is the dilemma of the hydrogen economy and one that hypersolar aims to address for over a century splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis has been well known theoretically this technology can be used to produce an unlimited amount of clean and renewable hydrogen fuel to power a carbonfree world however in practice current commercial electrolysis technologies require a expensive electricity and b highly purified water to prevent fouling of system components we believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of renewable hydrogen the perfect and sustainable energy cycle as it turns out mother nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules ho into its basic elements  hydrogen and oxygen this is exactly what plant leaves do every day using photosynthesis since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant we cant simply grow trees to make hydrogen if technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen then a truly sustainable low cost and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the earth for millenniums however cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision water splitting in the process of splitting a water molecule input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds of the resulting hydrogen molecule so in essence manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or batterylike storage of the input energy if the input energy is from fossil fuels such as oil and gas then dirty carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen if the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen while the concept of water splitting is very appealing the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable energy inefficiency — since hydrogen is an energy carrier the most energy it can store is  of the input energy however conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components wires and electrodes that only a fraction the solar electricity actually makes it into the hydrogen molecules this translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production hypersolar is addressing this problem with its low cost and energy efficient technology need for clean water —conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components this prevents current technology from using the large quantities of free water from oceans rivers industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock hypersolars technology is designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen breakthrough nanotechnology electrolysis watersplitting in its simplest form is the transfer of input electrons in the following chemical reactions cathode reduction  ho  e  h   oh anode oxidation      oh  o   ho   e from these equations it is easy to see that if every input electron e is put to work and not lost then a maximum amount of input electrons ie energy is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules h additionally if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split every single water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available to address this fundamental electron transfer efficiency problem hypersolar is developing a novel nanoparticle to maximally ensure that every single electron is put to work in splitting a water molecule our nanoparticle has two very important features selfcontained photoelectrochemical nanosystem — our low cost nanosize particle technology is designed to mimic photosynthesis and contains a solar absorber that generates electrons from sunlight as well as integrated cathode and anode areas to readily split water and transfer those electrons to the molecular bonds of hydrogen unlike solar panels or wind turbines that produce a sizeable number of electrons that will be lost before reaching the hydrogen bonds our nanoparticles are optimized at the nanolevel to ensure maximal electron generation and utilization efficiency consequently our nanoparticle technology uses substantially fewer photovoltaic elements an expensive material than conventional solar panels to achieve the same system level efficiency thereby significantly lowering the system cost of what is essentially an electrolysis process protective coating — the biggest problem with submerging photovoltaic elements in water for direct electrolysis is corrosion and short circuiting to address this problem we have developed a protective coating that encapsulates key elements of the nanoparticle to allow it to function for a long periods of time in a wide range of water conditions without corrosion this allows the nanoparticles to be submerged or dissolved into virtually any source of water such as sea water runoff water river water or waste water instead of purified distilled water by managing the science of electrolysis at the nanolevel we believe that our nanoparticle technology can deliver unmatched cost reductions to enable the commercial production of renewable hydrogen from any sources of water with sunlight as the only source of energy our nanoparticle technology is a next generation solution however during the process of developing this technology we have achieved a number of discrete technology breakthroughs that have allowed us to develop a commercial solution for
