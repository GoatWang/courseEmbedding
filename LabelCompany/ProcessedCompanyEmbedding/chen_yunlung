technical field  the present disclosure relates to automatic vending machines   description of related art  automatic vending machines allow customers to buy merchandise twenty four hours a day when the customer retrieves the merchandise from the automatic vending machine a helical element in a cabinet is rotated to push the merchandise out of the cabinet however a free end of the helical element may be warped or otherwise act to snag or catch on the merchandise preventing delivery of the merchandise out of the cabinet therefore there is room for improvement within the art brief description of the drawings  many aspects of the embodiments can be better understood with reference to the following drawings the components in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale the emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the embodiments moreover in the drawings like reference numerals designate corresponding parts throughout the several views  fig  is an exploded isometric view of an automatic vending machine in accordance with an embodiment  fig  is an isometric view of a pressing member of the automatic vending machine of fig   fig  is an assembled view of the automatic vending machine of fig  detailed description  the disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements it should be noted that references to “an” or “one” embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment and such references mean “at least one”  figs  and  illustrate an automatic vending machine in accordance with an embodiment the automatic vending machine comprises a cabinet  a pressing member  a helical element  and a driving member  for example the driving member  may be a motor  the cabinet  comprises a bottom plate  a mounting portion  extending from the bottom plate  and a rear plate  extending from the bottom plate  in one embodiment the mounting portion  is substantially lshaped and the rear plate  is substantially perpendicular to the bottom plate  the driving member  is secured to the rear plate  and the driving member  comprises a rotating shaft  a first end of the helical element  is secured to the rotating shaft  so that the helical element  can be rotated by the driving member  a second end of the helical element  is located above the mounting portion   the mounting portion  comprises a first flange  and a second flange  substantially perpendicular to the first flange  the first flange  and the bottom plate  are located on a same plane a plurality of securing holes  is defined in the second flange   the pressing member  comprises a main post  a first securing portion  extending from a first end of the main post  and a second securing portion  extending from a second opposite end of the main post   the first securing portion  comprises a first extending post  a second extending post  a third extending post  a fourth extending post  and a fifth extending post  the first extending post  extends downward relative to the main post  the second extending post  substantially perpendicular extends from first extending post  the third extending post  extends from the second extending post  and abuts the second extending post  so that the second extending post  and the third extending post  together define a first clipping portion  the fourth extending post  substantially perpendicular extends from third extending post  the fifth extending post  extends substantially perpendicular fix all from fourth extending post  and is substantially parallel to the third extending post  a second clipping portion  extends downward from the fifth extending post   the second securing portion  extends upward from the main post  and is hung on the rotating shaft  in one embodiment a length of the main post  is substantially equal to a length between the rear plate  and the first flange  that is the main post  is substantially as long as long as the helical element   figs  illustrate assembly of the automatic vending machine in accordance with an embodiment in assembly the pressing member  extends into the interior of the helical element  and the second securing portion  is clipped with the rotating shaft  the first clipping portion  and the second clipping portion  are engaged in two of the plurality of securing holes  so that the pressing member  is secured to the cabinet  the main post  is substantially parallel to the bottom plate  and bears down on the helical element  for preventing helical element  from becoming warped  when the helical element  is rotated the helical element  is rotated outside the pressing member  and the pressing member  does not prevent the free rotation of the helical element  items of merchandise are thus supported along the length of the pressing member  and the presence of the pressing member  under the merchandise acts to stabilize the items of merchandise when being moved  it is to be understood however that even though numerous characteristics and advantages have been set forth in the foregoing description of embodiments together with details of the structures and functions of the embodiments the disclosure is illustrative only and changes may be made in detail especially in the matters of shape size and arrangement of parts
