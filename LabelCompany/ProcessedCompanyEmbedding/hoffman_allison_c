and the sports dome  killdeer north canton oh may  today i was in the parking lot of half an abandoned property that has been blank for the past  years the other half of the property has an indoor sporting complex that uses the same parking lot adjacent to the sporting complex there are two tennis courts and a partially gravel parking lot i was there in the grassy area looking for brown headed cowbird and common grackle as soon as i drove onto the property in the parking lot there was a killdeer just sitting in the middle of the parking lot i learned in ornithology a trick to make sure that i do not get it killdeer confused with the different birds they have two stripes a different colors on their next and they have  ls intheir namethe killdeer is a plover and you can see it without going near a body of water it usually hangs out in parking lots sporting fields and sometimes golf courses they usually run across the ground in short spurts with pauses in between their noise has a highpitched kill deer sounding voice as the bird takes flight north canton is part of their summer breeding ground the killdeer usually does a broken wing act to distract predators from their offspring this one did not do any type of broken wing act so that leads me to think it was not near any offspring  killdeer may  north canton oh the background is where the pool used to be black imaging is the interior of my car every picture i took of the bird was from my car i never even opened any of my doors the killdeer was able to let me drive within  feet of it and get hundreds of pictures as the killdeer moved around i would shift my vehicle to get a better angle in the background in the picture is where the pool used to be and all that was filled in with dirt after being excavated panoramic picture of where the pool used to be on the property to the left is the sporting complex  the killdeer mainly hung out on the gravel part of the parking lot the property is right in the middle of a very suburban residential area the killdeer in the middle of the gravel parking lot may  the killdeer seemed naturally at home it kept ruffling its feathers and preening its plumage while i was just a dozen feet away  the killdeer had its feathers ruffled after preening may  around pm i was very surprised to see to killdeer in this area because i have never seen any other birds in this area other than the typical song birds i have lived at this residence my entire life and i have never encountered a killdeer as i tried to get a closer picture i decided to try and step out of my car and then the killdeer flew away as it took flight it made the iconic noise that a killdeer makes i have heard it around my house in the past week but i just doubted my hearing and shrug it off as another bird and then i was very surprised when i found it the whole excursion lasted about  minutes  comments easter  birding   comments   ​sorry i took so long to post this one it has been a very

state nature preserve   comments   this is my first post so it is going to be pretty short​on feb th  i was hiking at sells park and dale  jackie riddle state nature preserve they are both are in athens ohio and are right next door to each other  they are both adjacent to strouds run state park the preserve has old growth forest and sits on the foothills of the allegheny plateau athens got a break from the cold weather and there was much activity in the area i saw  pileated woodpeckers robins tufted titmice and a couple of white tail deer i was able to get a picture of a redbellied woodpecker melanerpes carolinus  it was perched on the side of a tree about  feet high the common name is sort of misrepresentative because the most noticeable red area is on the head some confuse it for the redheaded woodpecker melanerpes erythrocephalus  redbellied woodpecker athens oh feb   comments future adventures   comments   i will be starting a blog about various nature adventures i have
