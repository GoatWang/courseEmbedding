severs greenco from retail energy business  energy manager today news and best practices for commercial  industrial energy managers skip to contentnababbc’ border’′ alt”  split decision nrg severs greenco from retail energy business september  september   by cheryl kaften nrg energy – the operator of texasbased retail energy provider reliant energy as well as a roster of renewable and fossil fuel energy firms – announced plans to restructure and “streamline” on september  following a disappointing quarter during which the company ‘s stock dropped nearly  percentthe reorganization will split nrg into two divisions – one the highstakes but lowprofit clean energy business and the other its conventional generation and electricity retailing subsidiariesin a conference call with the media and investment analysts ceo david crane said that under an initiative called nrg reset the company would form a new “greenco” unit as of january   – which would comprise nrg home solar nrg evgo and nrg renewnrg’s other business interests would have a separate bottom line – including its wholesale generation division the reliant retail business and the company’s yieldco nrg yieldconcurrently nrg also announced plans to execute a dropdown for  million to nrg yield of  percent of the equity interests in an megawatt mw portfolio of wind projects gained through the acquisition in  of edison mission energythe restructuring will according to snl financial allow for a simpler nrg group and be coupled with a companywide effort to “unlock capital” and shrink the balance sheetindeed crane said that although greenco initially will be operated completely under the nrg imprimatur nrg also will pursue strategic partnering alternatives for the new entity in response to an analyst inquiry regarding a sale or spinoff of greenco crane said that discussions regarding the future of the new division are “just starting” but that nrg intends to at least retain a stake in greencocrane who to date had been an unabashed advocate of green energy now has been forced to take a step back by the economics of the industry he pledged that nrg’s financial support of greenco will not exceed  million and went a step further – noting that if the division’s renewable businesses cannot find a way to be profitable nrg may have to shutter one or more of them or find alternative fundingthis is not the first time that nrg has restructured in hopes of operating more costefficiently indeed just a year ago the company split into three parts – nrg home nrg business  and nrg renew – in hopes of creating a better platform for growthamong nrg’s professed reasons for not exiting the green energy market entirely is the value that the company may accrue in texas from the relationship between greenco and reliant energy the retail energy provider has  million customers in the lone star state who may be interested in a crosssell operationalizing ehs management bridge the gap from strategy to

groups come out against the suniva solarworld trade case markets  policy nrg to lay off  employees with restructuring of its home solar business the company will refocus its residential solar business on the northeast but will it keep enough momentum to stay relevant by julia pyper may   the company will refocus its residential solar business on the northeast but will it keep enough momentum to stay relevant by julia pyper may    nrg energy announced the conclusion of the greenco process on its firstquarter earnings call this week with the majority interest sale of nrg evgo to investment firm vision ridge partners and a restructuring of nrg home solar that will result in layoffs involving  employees with the restructuring the residential solar business will move back under nrg’s retail arm by the end of the year nrg home solar will also shift its business model to focus on customer acquisition installation and direct thirdparty sales nrg has entered into agreements with sunrun and spruce finance to purchase and support solar contracts originated by nrg an approach management said will simplify financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition “we have turned the page on this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing on our plan” said ceo mauricio gutierrez on thursday’s earnings call “while nrg home solar is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter our strategy for this business is important to our organization allowing us to maintain a viable yet rightsized structure” he added to streamline the business nrg plans to refocus its residential solar business on three northeast markets  new jersey new york and massachusetts  where the company believes it has a competitive advantage according to gutierrez this move positions nrg to offer residential solar to its existing  million retail customers in texas when the economics for residential solar in ercot improve in the meantime an nrg spokesperson confirmed that the streamlining process will result in “around  layoffs” across the country kelcy pegler jr resigned as ceo of nrg home solar last month “the nrg home solar integration allows nrg to remain in the residential solar business in a more effective and economical way continuing to provide the best value to investors and customers and enable the longterm success of employees” according to the spokesperson “as opportunities arise for serving other markets we will evaluate them on a casebycase basis” in  nrg home solar saw an ebitda loss of  million in  the home solar division is already running at a loss of  million nrg expects to pay a onetime restructuring cost of  million which gutierrez said will enable the home solar business to break even on an ebitda basis by  home solar demoted the market responded positively to nrg’s firstquarter earnings report with nrg’s stock price climbing roughly  percent on friday julien dumoulinsmith executive director of equity research at ubs securities said the restructuring of nrg’s home solar business is “ideal” “while many investors wanted to see nrg exit this market entirely we think this is ultimately the right move” he wrote in a note to investors a complete selldown of the business would have removed the opportunity for a longterm upside from marketing solar to nrg’s  million retail customers in texas the frontend monetization for complete sales to a spruce or sunrun also makes sense dumoulinsmith said this structure is likely to generate around cash margins of  cents per watt on sales for nrg according to a ubs analysis assuming a modest initial pace of  megawatts per year could ramp up to  megawatts per year ubs calculates nrg would generate roughly  million in free cash flow per year “the solar partnership will be a small incremental contributor off the wider retail franchise but a positive rather than a historical negative” dumoulinsmith wrote in a note to investors the nearterm focus on breaking even may erode any advantages nrg has in the residential solar space however subordinating nrg home solar to nrg retail could see the business waste away in the highly competitive us solar marketplace “the restructuring of nrg home solar makes it apparent that residential solar is unsurprisingly not a strategic priority for the company” said nicole litvak senior solar analyst at gtm research “with home solar demoted from its own division to simply an offering through the retail business it seems unlikely that it will be able to sustain the growth it experienced over the past year” “nrg says it will focus its efforts on massachusetts new jersey and new york  all strong growth markets for residential solar  but it faces stiff competition from installers like trinity solar and amergy that are quickly scaling in those states in additional to the national players” she said in  nrg was the no  residential installer in the us with a market share of  percent it was no  in new jersey and no  in massachusetts and new york a vision for ev expansion nrg also announced that vision ridge a climateactionoriented investment firm has made a  million investment in nrg’s evgo electric car charging network vision ridge will pay  million in cash to nrg and invest the remainder in the evgo business this new capital in conjunction with nrg’s remaining commitment of  million under the california settlement is said to position evgo with more than  million of infrastructure funding to expand the charging network beyond existing metro areas going forward nrg has no capital commitments to evgo save for the settlement obligation nrg became one of the most aggressive builders of electricvehicle infrastructure with the launch of evgo in  evgo currently operates  fast chargers in more than  metro markets across the country but it’s been a moneylosing business with  million in losses in  hurt by sluggish electricvehicle sales despite the segment’s underwhelming performance vision ridge as an investment firm with substantial experience in latestage sustainable and clean energy projects believes it’s a strategic time to invest in electricvehicle charging “electric vehicles are here now american consumers are starting to see how much better these cars are not just for the planet but as fun to drive and cheaper to maintain” reuben munger the managing partner at vision ridge wrote in an email “battery technology and range keep improving and a charging network is a key part of the solution for american drivers our investment is a sign of how excited we are about both where this technology is today and its enormous growth potential” “nrg is proud of the leadership that evgo has established under our guidance” said arun banskota president of evgo in a statement “as nrg looked at potential partners and investors for evgo it was important for us to align our business with a firm that is focused on building and investing in a sustainable energy future we are confident that vision ridge will provide the added resources and specific expertise to take evgo to the next level in sustainable transportation” the changes announced this week bring an end to the greenco which was formed last fall as former ceo david crane came under pressure for making an expensive push into clean energy the restructuring eliminates the need for the  million greenco fund and has allowed nrg to reaffirm its  guidance of  billion to  billion said gutierrez to help strengthen the company’s balance sheet nrg reintegrated its business renewables division into the company last quarter which is expected to provide a growth opportunity for nrg yield the yieldco showed strong performance in the first quarter of  and reaffirmed its guidance for the year nrg
