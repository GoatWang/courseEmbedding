w i service road oklahoma city ok  for instructions on how to proceed with your warranty claim this warranty is void if mattress andor foundation have been burned soiled damaged or is in an unsanitary condition since stains of any kind void the warranty you are urged to use a highly absorbent mattress pad this warranty is valid only for the original purchaser and valid only for residential use contract and commercial usages are not covered by this warranty this warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have rights which vary from state to state the manufacturer is not responsible for any incidental or consequential damages unless this limitation is specifically prohibited by local or state statute implied warranties are limited to the period of this warranty unless this limitation is specifically prohibited by local or state statute mattress care your lady americana mattress and foundation will provide you with years of excellent service if you follow these easy instructions to insure that you receive the support that is built into your lady americana mattress insist on the matching lady americana foundation do not be misled into believing that it is sufficient to buy a new mattress only after your present mattress shows wear and tear mattress failure or “wear out” is often caused by foundation failure as stated on the warranty information for your lady americana mattress andor foundation use at least  hardwood bed slats of ” width or wider under your lady americana sleep set if you use a bedstead or a  legged bed frame under twin and full size sets a legged frame under queen size and a legged frame under king size use a high quality absorbent mattress pad this will keep the covering of the mattress fresh and clean never apply liquids of any kind to mattress surfaces don’t jump or stand on your lady americana sleep set misuse of this kind could cause unnecessary damage and the voiding of your warranty don’t bend your lady americana mattress when turning the mattress or moving it from one location to another it is almost impossible for you to straighten a mattress whose border rod has been bent such abuse voids your warranty   definitions “warranty” the manufacturer’s assurance that certain standards will be met by the performance of the mattress and box spring for a specified period of time “limited warranty” this indicates that the warranty provided does not extend to every possible situation there are situations that are excluded therefore the warranty is “limited” rather than “unlimited” no mattress manufacturer offers an “unlimited” warranty because there are so many situations outside of its control “nonprorated” if any problem occurs that is covered by the warranty during the term of the warranty purchaser will not be charged for any repair made or if necessary any exchange of the mattress andor box spring   who is the warrantor the warrantor is the lady americana factory that manufactured the mattress andor box spring lady americana associates inc laa licenses independent mattress manufacturers to produce and market lady americana products laa does not determine any specific warranty for any lady americana product in the event the factory that manufactured your warranted product ceases operations this warranty ceases to exist only the factory determines which products will be warranted and for what period what does your warranty cover this warranty covers any defects in workmanship andor materials that occur during the term of the warranty some examples but not limited to these examples coil wire piercing the covering of the mattress or box spring innerspring unit failure wherein the unit collapses to date lady americana has never experienced this problem the top panels andor side panels of the mattress not held in place by the two tapes top and bottom that encompass the entire perimeter of the mattress the top of the box spring only the collapse of the box spring wire unit effective mattress life definition the effective life of a mattress is the period in which it is able to provide proper sleep support and comfort to its users how long is the effective life of your mattress actually no one not even the manufacturer of your mattress knows for certain there are many variables not limited to those listed below the weight of the users how many hours per night the product is used the usages of the product other than for sleeping reading tv watching etc how often the mattress is moved from one location to another and how it is handled and stored in transit whether the mattress is being used with the foundation made for it the better sleep council suggests that the average effective life of a new mattress is  years obviously that means some mattresses have a longer period others a shorter term however when the mattress is  years old you should inspect it closely then and from then on for signs of wearing out remember your new mattress is its most effective in its first night of service to you every night afterward it loses a bit of its effectiveness very slowly and very subtly to the point that you’ll never notice it until one day or night you’ll realize that youre not receiving a good night’s sleep from it that’s the time to replace it here’s a question often asked “if i have a mattress with a year warranty why should i be inspecting my mattress in  years” the answer is that your warranty covers defects in workmanship and materials not wearing out again review all the variables listed for determining effective mattress life even though your mattress has worn out this does not indicate that the mattress will be literally falling apart if you choose to continue its use after it is worn out your warranty against defects in workmanship and materials is still in effect how can you void your warranty the chief cause of warranty voidance is the soiling of the mattress blood urine or other stains void the warranty you are sincerely encouraged to use a quality mattress pad that has a high absorption rate abuse of the mattress andor box spring children repeatedly jumping on the mattress will ultimately cause the mattress to fail in some manner bending the mattress during delivery or when moving it no innerspring mattress especially a lady americana mattress with the ameri guard® total perimeter support system can be bent without permanent damage if the mattress is bent to get it up a small or winding stairwell or into a room with a subsize opening the warranty is void lack of suitable support under the foundation queen size sleep sets require a legged bed frame with center support king size sets require either separate frames for each foundation or a legged frame with center support if you use bed slats a minimum of  hardwood slats is required if you do not purchase the foundation made to be used with your mattress you still have the full warranty on your mattress however an improper foundation wrong construction worn out etc can be the cause of damage to the mattress if so the mattress warranty is null and void also you should be aware that the “feel” of the mattress in the store would differ from the “feel” of the mattress on an old foundation   privacy  terms    mathis brothers furniture  all rights reserved california transparency in supply chains act
