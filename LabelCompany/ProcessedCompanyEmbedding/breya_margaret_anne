experiences that will have the biggest roi for your business register now » so youve invented the next great gadget and youre sure itll be a hit in fact youve got cartons of inventory stored in every room of your house that youre itching to sell sell sell your test market said they love it but how can you reach the legions of consumers youre sure will want to buy itwelcome to sales  while there are countless books you can read about sales and marketing heres a relatively simple proven strategy thatll teach you how to market a product and grow your salescreate a sales planfirst define your market as accurately as possible so you have a deeper understanding of exactly who youre selling to for example instead of all women it may be working women with aboveaverage incomes and kids under age  instead of all men it may be divorced men in their s with sixfigure salaries the more specific you get the more accurately youll be able to target your sales and marketing efforts choosing the sales channels most receptive to your productnext youll need to develop a sales plan before you groan another plan understand this can be a simple document for your eyes only thatll help you organize and think through your sales strategy write it in a way that makes sense for you typically it should include the followingsales goals these goals should be specific and measurable not something like selling a million units base them on the nature of your product and try to break them down into manageable parts for example sell  units to endusers in  days and sell  units to local independent retailers in six monthssales activities these are your tacticshow you plan to make the sale you may say youll sell directtoconsumer through a website or via craft shows for instance or this part of the plan may include activities like developing a sell sheet to send to independent retail storestarget accounts your sales plan should also include the accounts you want to sell to if its endusers for example plan how youre going to reach them through ebay classified ads or your websitetimelines put dates to all of the above elements so you can define your steps within a realistic timeline dont forget that your timelines should be fluidif youre underachieving your sales plan can help you figure out why and define the corrective steps you need to takefinally follow a proven process for growing sales over time while it would be fabulous to have walmart carry your product right out of the gate it may not be realistic most large retailers want to see a track record of successful sales before agreeing to take on a new product build your marketto learn how to bring a product to market begin by selling directly to endusers thisll give you confidence that theres demand for your product and will also create referenceable customers that you can contact for product and packaging feedback before you hit the bigger leagues so where can you reach your endusersthe web is one highly effective channel and you can reach your market through your own website or via a site like ebay you can also tap into your own personal network as you begin host a home party to share your product with friends and friendsoffriends sell through local community groups and email your networkonce you get feedback directly from your customers refine the packaging and price point before approaching your next marketwholesalers youll probably start with small independently owned local stores its a good idea to start with them before hitting larger chain stores because its easier to get in touch with the direct decisionmaker and theyre more inclined to take on new unique or hardtofind items to differentiate themselves from larger stores to sell to these retailers be prepared and bring a product sell sheet photos product samples if possible and a succinct introductory letter to explain whats in it for them highlighting your products profit margin features and benefits and proven sales recordexpand to new marketsonce youve established sales strength with independent retailers and are ready to support new markets its time to sell to the big guns of course exactly who those big guns are will depend on your product for some its powerhouse general mass retailers like walmart and target while other products will fit more specialized but equally powerful retailers like williamssonoma the sharper image and sephoranote that when dealing with these major accounts the sale is just the beginning of the deal handling fulfillment returns rollbacks slotting fees advertising and more will require strengthening your businesss infrastructure and resourcesbut back to the sale whats the best way to approach a larger retailer heres a quick cheat sheetget the correct buyer one of your biggest challenges is finding the right buyer within a large organization so do your homework if youre experiencing roadblocks consider hiring a distributor or manufacturers rep who already has established relationships in your industrybe prepared develop a presentation and have professionallooking sell sheets ready your product should also have packaging thats ready to goknow your target understand what products they already carry and how yours will fit in dont waste your time pitching to a retailer whos unlikely to carry your producttake advantage of special programs some mass retailers such as walmart have local purchase programs that give managers authority to try local items and other retailers may have different initiatives such as minority business programsbe patient it can take up to a year or longer before you see your product on store shelves so dont get frustrated and if the final answer is no try to turn it into a learning experiencefinally remember there are other sales channels besides the traditional brickandmortar retail store catalogs tv shopping networks and online stores can also be excellent methods to enable you to learn how to market a product

the pilothouse retracted  regular readers of the waterways journal are by now familiar with the unique method that magnolia marine developed to bring new vessels into the fold so to speak rather than the traditional bottle breaking the chief engineer pours blessed oil into the boat’s engine a novelty that grew out of the lampton family’s strong spirituality said lee lampton one of four sons in the business and the one responsible for the marine segment when the company began adding new boats and naming them after family members the lamptons sought a more meaningful way than the traditional champagne christening to send the boats off on their endeavors  “it was at a meeting we had in  before we put the mv mr lampton to work that we decided to make the event more of a spiritual celebration than a party” lee lampton said “we thought why not bless the oil which is after all the life blood of the engine” since then magnolia marine has blessed seven towboats in this fashion all but two of which the mvs jody mcminn and stan humphreys were named for family members the practice has grown so popular with the crews that when the mv emily davis was hurried into service without being blessed the captain feared it might be haunted magnolia marine conducted a blessing ceremony shortly thereafter the engines that received the blessed oil on the margaret ann are twin caterpillar

moment to be sure he got the number right she was given a framed certificate commemorating the event the captain then received a ship’s bible from the rev michael nation of seamen’s church institute
