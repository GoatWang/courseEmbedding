education heart disease in women qa  are women at higher risk for cardiovascular disease than men heart disease is more prevalent in men than women and remains the leading cause of death for both sexes cardiovascular disease on the other hand which also includes heart failure hypertension and stroke is more prevalent in women likewise each year more women than men die of cardiovascular disease six times as many women die from heart disease as from breast cancer— about  each year an estimated  million american women suffer from heart disease one out of every four women will die of heart disease and one out of every two will die of cardiovascular disease women have more heart attacks than men that go unrecognized who is at risk how can i reduce my risk two out of every three women who die suddenly of heart disease have no prior history of cardiovascular disease several risk factors can raise your risk including a family history of cardiovascular disease high blood pressure diabetes smoking abnormal cholesterol even if you have normal cholesterol after menopause the amount of lowdensity lipoproteins or ldl “bad cholesterol” may increase because of the lowered levels of estrogen your risk of developing high blood pressure diabetes and cardiovascular disease increases if you are overweight or obese have an unhealthy diet including excessive alcohol consumption don’t exercise regularly you can lower your risk significantly by eating a hearthealthy diet that is low in saturated fat sugar and salt maintaining a healthy weight being physically active limiting the amount of alcohol you drink not smoking psychological distress can be a risk factor women with depression and anxiety are more likely to die of heart disease women are also more prone to depression than men after a heart attack—and that raises the risk of another attack how are the symptoms of heart attack different in women chest pain is the classic symptom of a heart attack but it can also feel like   pressure tightness squeezing or burning women can have other symptoms too shortness of breath lightheadedness dizziness nausea or vomiting sweating unusual fatigue arm or shoulder pain usually leftsided but may be rightsided pain in neck jaw back or abdomen what are the most important elements in heart health care for women finding a clinician who specializes in women’s heart health raises the odds that you’ll be evaluated by someone who knows what to look for and how to look for it clinician’s current standards for diagnosis are primarily based on research performed on men women are more likely to get misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed because the symptoms they experience may not be consistent with these standards in addition women are less likely to be referred for appropriate testing what are the latest advances in diagnosis and treatment for heart disease in women many women experiencing symptoms may have a normal stress test or angiogram which are tests often used to evaluate chest pain heart disease in women can affect smaller blood vessels instead of the large ones assessed in these standard tests stanford is one of the few heart centers in the us using special testing techniques tailored to find the microvascular disease or endothelial dysfunction that is more prevalent in women for many women a treatment called percutaneous coronary intervention or pci will be appropriate the procedure passes a catheter or narrow tubing through arteries until the catheter reaches the site of a heart blockage once there a balloon is inflated within the artery to relieve the blockage and restore blood flow traditionally the catheter was inserted in an artery in the groin in women however that location produces two to three times the rate of bleeding and vascular complications jennifer tremmel md sm clinical director of women’s heart health at stanford uses a transradial approach inserting the catheter in the radial artery an artery in the wrist the

need help clear stanford health now education preventing heart disease qa  when should i start paying attention to my heart health it is never too early to start whether or not you develop heart disease will depend on modifiable factors your behaviors and environment genetic factors or a combination of both the most common form of heart disease coronary artery disease typically begins in early adulthood some people are born with inherited heart or metabolic problems that raise their risk for the early appearance of heart health issues knowing something about your familys health history is a good start get screened regularly to find out if you have high ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol high blood pressure or high blood sugar—conditions that are relatively symptomless but that raise your risk for coronary artery disease you can calculate your risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next  years by entering your personal risk factor information at toolscardiosourceorgascvdriskestimator how can i avoid heart disease for most of us reducing our risk of heart disease means adopting behaviors long known to keep a heart healthy eating hearthealthy food being physically active not smoking maintaining an appropriate weight the dash and mediterranean diets have both proven effective as hearthealthy learning how to manage stress is also important because longterm stress can contribute to unhealthy behaviors increase blood pressure and may independently cause heart attacks control of risk factors with lifestyle change and sometimes with medications like statins can reduce the risk of heart attacks for some people with specific genetic conditions like familial hypercholesterolemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the effect of their genes tends to dominate the effect of environment although environment continues to play a role for people without such a strong genetic component a family history of heart disease may still provide clues some drugs including cocaine and methamphetamines and medical treatments such as chemotherapy can also damage the heart other medical conditions like diabetes and sleep apnea can also raise your risk for heart disease so finding good care for those conditions is also important as you grow older it also makes sense to know the symptoms of a heart attack so you can seek prompt medical attention if they occur heart attack symptoms in women can be very different from those seen in men knowing those symptoms will allow you to seek prompt treatment does intensity of exercise matter the intensity of exercise is less important than just being active in other words moving off the couch and becoming a regular walker does more to reduce the risk of heart disease than increasing the intensity of exercise from moderate to high the heart is a muscle and like any muscle responds well to exercise those of us who did not grow up playing sports or doing exercise may be discouraged by the thought of running bicycling swimming skiing and rowing it is important to know that activities like gardening vacuuming and walking up stairs count as activities that help your heart try to get at least  minutes of physical activity every day wearing a pedometer or using some other device that can be downloaded to a smart phone can help motivate people to reach their physical activity goals what’s new in heart disease prevention in recent years research has identified some important genetic influences on heart health—and clinical care has become more effective in preventing the worst consequences that increased level of knowledge has added genetic analysis as a tool to find new therapeutic drugs and to better understand the disease process research has also confirmed without question that smoking diet and exercise are directly related to heart health in certain people such as those with a strong family history of heart attacks screening for coronary artery calcium has become an effective way to detect early deposits of cholesterol in coronary arteries before they cause symptoms this discovery often leads to better risk factor control that can reduce the chances of having a heart attack is it ever too late to make changes to reduce my risk for heart disease it is never too late to make changes to reduce the risk of having a heart attack amazingly enough when people who have smoked for decades quit smoking within two years their risk of having a heart attack falls within two years to that of someone who has never smoked learn more about the stanford preventive

attacks than men that go unrecognized who is at risk how can i reduce my risk two out of every three women who die suddenly of heart disease have no prior history of cardiovascular disease several risk factors can raise your risk including a family history of cardiovascular disease high blood pressure diabetes smoking abnormal cholesterol even if you have normal cholesterol after menopause the
