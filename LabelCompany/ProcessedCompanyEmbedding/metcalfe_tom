issuecurrent issuesubscribefollow usadvertisementadvertisement tom metcalfe’s perfect coffee maker and the design revolution behind it by cliff kuang minute readtom metcalfe’s coffer maker isn’t going to make anyone’s morning routine quicker–that’s not the point instead he sought to make the process a ritual with the result being a platonically perfect cup of coffee the device is disarmingly simple two burners inside a lacquered box and three glass beakers but the process is a bit more complex than your normal drip first you roast the beans yourself for  minutes then you grind them and finally they steep for four minutes not a quick pick me up–rather a stubbornly slow one the design details are spot on—witness the clever ribs in the roasting beaker around minute  of the video below which turn the coffee beans over if the beaker was smooth the beans wouldn’t be heated evenly advertisementit sounds like a stretch but the idea of creating longlived statement products has profound implications as metcalfe says “to achieve genuine sustainability products must not be temporary or transient” you might call that philosophy longcycling–and designers are increasingly signing up for it in an age where making new stuff rather than holding on to what we already have inevitably churns up more carbon the macarthurfellow and inventor saul griffiths for example makes the intriguing point that buying a rolex might be an environmental move if you make a product that lasts ten times longer that’s the same as cutting its carbon footprint by a factor of tenhere’s a couple more nice

product designer tom metcalfe shared his learnings from his microresidency with the national composites centre posted by rosie cooke rosie was the pervasive media studio assistant between  speakers tom metcalfe designer builds physicaldigital products discovers and maps factories in bristol and bath runs an interaction design talk chapter tutors on an experience design ma over the past six months studio resident tom metcalfe has been developing his understanding of composite materials from an art and design perspective through a microresidency supported by the bristolbased national composites centre in a lunchtime talk he presented the various iterations of a compositesbased hourglass vase and explained the process here are five key points i took away  broadly speaking composite materials are made of two or more different materials to make them more robust an early example is mud and straw to make bricks plywood is a common composite material and a more complex example would be carbon fibre these materials are used in all manner of industries  to make lightweight but strong aeronautical or maritime vehicles in the production of kevlar vests to develop safe sporting equipment such as skis and skates and to generate energy amongst many other applications   in being selected for the microresidency tom was granted access to the manufacturing plant that typically has exclusive use by skilled professionals due to the complex processes required tom was keen to explore the craftsmanship that goes into that process and find ways to make composites more accessible to artists and designers currently materials are often expensive difficult to massproduce and recycle and the use of the making spaces filled with necessary machinery implicate health and safety issues tom hoped to test these barriers to determine an entrylevel to composite craft   tom created his vases in an approach he likened to traditional tailoring his first successful layup involved coating an existing vase with release film wrapping it in glass cloth with a multidirectional stretch as opposed to the onedirectional stretch of carbon fibre using a spray mount to set and impregnating with resin once dried tom had achieved a hardy and interesting half vase shell with a texture on the outside and a smooth and glossy resinsoaked underside   in the next iteration of the vase to achieve the neat wrapping of the material tom will have to introduce robotic intervention to map and cut a petal shape that will adjoin when sculpted to the shape of the vase   a useful method for predicting the use of composites is to compare to properties in the natural world such as skin if you can understand the way skin stretches across the contours of the body and its malleability you come some way to understanding the benefit of composites and their unique features  lunchtime talk writeup sinfonidría  making a giant musical instrument posted on fri  jan  in this inspiring lunchtime talk we were
