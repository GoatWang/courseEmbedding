cash or leveraged  exchange rules once an exchanger closes on the sale of an investment property he or she must identify a possible replacement for the relinquished property within  days as outlined by the  exchange period the  exchange time limits and irs rules of section  are outlined in rev proc  the basic  exchange rules involve the  exchange time limit  exchange identification like kind exchange rules and how to designate property for a  commercial exchange when choosing a replacement property for the  exchange the owner must follow one of the following three  exchange rules  the “threeproperty”  exchange rule the owner may identify up to three properties regardless of their value  the “ percent”  exchange rule the owner may identify any number of  replacement properties as long as the combined fair market value fmv of those properties does not exceed  of the fmv of all sold properties  the “ percent”  exchange rule the owner may identify any number of  exchange properties no matter the aggregate fmv as long as  of the value of those identified  exchange properties is acquired in all cases of a  exchange the owner must close on the identified replacement propertys within  days from the sale date of the original property get  list  exchange requirements to fully defer all capital gain taxes a  exchanger must meet four  exchange requirements   exchange requirement the investor must reinvest a  of sale proceeds if a  exchanger does not reinvest all proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property the balance received is considered cash boot and the investor will have to pay capital gains taxes on that amount   exchange requirement the investor must acquire property with the same or greater debt if a  exchanger does not acquire a replacement property with an equal or greater amount of debt he or she is relieved of a debt obligation and this is called a mortgage boot the irs considers this reduction in debt a benefit to the  exchanger therefore it is taxable unless it is offset by adding equivalent cash to the replacement property purchase   exchange requirement the investor must use a “qualified  intermediary” also known as a “ facilitator” or “ accommodator” to hold the funds from the first sale until purchase of the new property is closed the “qualified  intermediary” qi acts as the “middleman” in the  exchange providing the paperwork oversight escrow services and expertise necessary to ensure that the transaction legally qualifies as a  exchange under section  of the internal revenue code even though a  exchange is a complicated process a  exchange using a good qi can become a simple transaction and look surprisingly like a standard sale   exchange requirement the new investment must be in “likekind” property irs  exchange rules require the  exchange of likekind relinquished property for other likekind replacement property this doesn’t mean though that  exchanged properties must be of the exact nature as the relinquished property bare land doesn’t have to be exchanged for bare land or income property exchanged for another income property any real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business can be exchanged in a  exchange for any other real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business get  list what is a qualified  intermediary a qualified intermediary is an independent agent that facilitates a  exchange the taxpayer’s attorney or accountant cannot be a qualified intermediary most intermediaries are affiliated with banks trust companies or title companies using a qualified intermediary is one way of “safe harboring” a  exchange essentially the qualified intermediary takes an assignment of rights in the sale contract for the old property and the purchase contract for the new property these are simple documents that the attorney fills out along with a basic exchange agreement with the intermediary through these three documents the intermediary is brought into the  exchange and subject to compliance with the timing rules discussed below the transaction can qualify as a  exchange rather than a taxable sale ensure your  exchange facilitator is fully qualified       meets the safe harbor requirements of a qualified intermediary to pass a passes a possible irs                 audit       is an independent facilitator this ensures you can work with the closing agent of your choice       is a  exchange expert with an understanding of how the exchange process works       is available as a resource to your accountant and attorney       audit proof every  exchange transaction needs to hold up to the scrutiny of the irs every situation is unique if you are planning to sell property and purchase likekind property contact us today or ask our expert online to find out how much you can save by deferring your capital gains taxes get  list the  exchange process in  easy steps there are several types of  exchanges the process is different for each type these are the steps for the most common type of  exchange a delayed exchange delayed exchange  property is sold and replacement property is purchased within  days replacement property must be identified within  days because of the  day window this is the most popular type of  exchange step   plan the transaction talk with your qualified intermediary to discuss your transaction after listening to your investment objectives well determine the best way to structure your transaction well estimate the amount of potential capital gains taxes youll save step   purchase  sale agreement the exchange often begins with a standard purchase and sale agreement the agreement should contain language which establishes the exchangers intent to exchange and obtains the buyers consent to cooperate your qualified intermediary will convert this sale transaction into an exchange with the use of specialized documentation step   relinquished property once you have decided to perform an exchange contact qualified intermediary immediately also notify all parties to the transaction of your intent to exchange including your real estate agent closing agent accountant and attorney your qualified intermediary will collect the information needed to prepare the exchange documents the originals will be forwarded to the closing agent for execution at closing copes are sent to all parties for review at closing the exchanger will transfer the relinquished property to qualified intermediary and qualified intermediary will simultaneously sell the property to the buyer the proceeds are then paid the qualified intermediary and held for the acquisition of the replacement property step   replacement property after closing the relinquished property the exchanger has  days to identify the replacement property and  days to complete the exchange the exchanger notifies qualified intermediary once they have entered into an agreement to purchase the replacement property qualified intermediary will deliver the documents needed to complete the exchange to the closing agent at closing the property is purchased by qualified intermediary and transferred to the exchanger the exchange is now complete get  list get  list get  list get  list call  now for your  list fix the following errorshide the requested url was not found on this
