situations contrarian longshort equity valuesummaryct energy holding srl a venezuelanitalian consortium has agreed to purchase from harvest senior secured notes convertible notes and warrants million senior secured convertible notes can be immediately converted into  shares of hnr stock which means that the shares have been valued at harvest also announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with ct energy holding srl and ct energia holding designed to maximize its venezuelan assetsit is hard to come up with a fair valuation here however looking at the whole deal hnr seems overvalued and should retreatthis article is an update to my preceding article on harvest natural resources nysehnr published on may   hnr month chart hnr data by ycharts on june  harvest natural resources announced that ct energy holding srl a venezuelanitalian consortium has agreed to purchase from harvest senior secured notes convertible notes and warrants harvest will immediately receive proceeds of  million from the sale of the senior secured notes and convertible notes   ct energy holding ct is acquiring  million worth of fiveyear  senior secured nonconvertible notes  million worth of fiveyear  senior secured convertible notes hnr is issuing to ct  shares of a newly created series of preferred stock that will entitle the holder to vote on an asif converted basis the  million worth of senior secured convertible notes are immediately convertible into  shares of hnr stock which means that the shares have been valued at  hnrs shares outstanding before the deal were worth  million and will be climbing to  million shares if ct exercises it based on hnrs closing price per share on friday of  the company is valued at  million no comments on that   ct energy holding is also acquiring a warrant to purchase up to  shares of hnr at an exercise price of  per share the warrant will become exercisable only after the day volumeweighted average price of harvests common stock equals or exceeds  per share and harvests stockholders approve the transaction with ct energy holding srl by a majority of votes cast as required by the new york stock exchange nyse shareholder approval rules the warrant is cashexercisable but ct energy holding srl may surrender the nonconvertible note to pay for a portion of the aggregate exercise price in august of  harvest stockholders will be asked to approve the transaction and increase common shares   harvest has announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with ct energy holding srl and ct energia holding designed to maximize its venezuelan assets i will not comment on this part because i believe it is only wishful thinking that will lead to nowhere again what does it mean using the bestcase scenario for ct ct will be able to exercise its warrants when the day average of hnr will be equal or above  after the transaction is approved by the stockholders which includes ct itself assuming hnrs stock price averages  for  days ct will exercise its warrants or pay hnr approximately  million in cash ct will be able to surrender the  million note and pay an extra  million to get the warrants the new shares outstanding will in this case be worth  million and ct may own up to  million shares or  of hnr ct will pay a total of  million   million   million   million however if the company decides to convert its  million shares and sell them at market using fridays close it will receive  million if the entire deal is not immediately completed and it cannot we should deduct roughly one years  interest on the  million note which would work out to  million thus ct will pay approximately  million for  million shares representing  of the total shares outstanding based on what ct is paying i came up with a bestcase scenario at  per share conclusion i have to concede that hnr is a resilient company as a few weeks ago i was not betting on the companys survival mr edminston has come up with a new financial scheme that will give the company a little more time and time is of the essence i do not think anyone believed that ct energy holding signed this deal to rescue hnr shareholders and it seems that hnr gave away much of the gabon potential  but the company really had no choice one unknown is the suspicious trading that preceded this deal which should be investigated by the sec i believe someone related to the parties illegally traded the stock on obvious insider knowledge disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
