conference call april    am et executives jan sucharda – president and chief executive officer bryan davis – chief financial officer analysts operator welcome ladies and gentlemen to the brookfield canada office properties first quarter  financial results conference call it is my pleasure to turn the call over to jan sucharda president and chief executive officer please go ahead jan sucharda good morning and thank you for joining us for our first quarter  conference call i will be chairing todays call and with me is bryan davis our chief financial officer i will begin by addressing the definitive agreement we entered into with brookfield property partners pursuant to which bpy would effectively acquire the approximately  equity interest in box that it or its subsidiaries do not already own for  in cash per unit an annual and special meeting of box unitholders will be scheduled for late june  to consider and vote on the transaction the box board of trustees intends to unanimously recommend that unitholders of box approve the transaction unitholders are urged to carefully review the management information circular that will be mailed to them within the next few weeks and that will be available on sedar at wwwsedarcom and edgar at wwwsecgov and our website wwwbrookfieldcanadareitcom assuming unitholder approval is received and the closing conditions are met it is currently expected that closing of the transaction will be completed in late june or early july i will now discuss the highlights for the quarter bryan will then take us through the financial results after which i will provide some commentary on the conditions of our markets and concluding remarks we saw positive momentum in the toronto market carried through from yearend as we completed several deals in the region overall occupancy remained at  which compared favorably to the national market rate of  during the first quarter we leased approximately  square feet with toronto accounting for the majority highlights were as follows a year lease with harlequin enterprises limited for square foot at bay adelaide east a sevenyear renewal with public works  government services canada for square foot at exchange tower and a sixyear lease with eventmobi for square foot at queens quay terminal with respect to operational initiatives construction at brookfield place calgary east continues to be on schedule and on budget the pavilion and lobby finishes are well underway and commissioning and testing of base building systems has commenced the building is on track to be delivered by the third quarter of this year i will now turn the call over to bryan to review our financial results bryan davis thank you jan and good morning but before i begin let me caution you that our discussions will include forwardlooking statements these statements that relate to future results and events are based on our current expectations our actual results in the future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions the risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material are outlined in our news release that was issued yesterday as noted in our news release we reported trust funds from operation totaling  million or  per unit for the first quarter of  this compares to  million or  per unit for the same period in  the increase of  million in trust ffo over the prior year was largely driven by same store noi increase of  million due to higher rent and net recoveries from new tenants and expansions in toronto offset by natural expiries at fifth avenue place we had lower interest expense of  million as a result of lower average outstanding corporate revolver balance and the sale of royal centre and this was offset by the disposition of royal centre which resulted in a loss of net operating income of  million dollars compared to last quarter trust ffo increased  million dollars primarily due to increased occupancy in brookfield place toronto adjusted funds from operation for the first quarter was  million or  per unit this compares to  million or  per unit for the same period in  the increase was mainly due to changes in trust ffo as previously discussed compared to the prior quarter affo was  million or  per unit in the prior quarter as for changes to the balance sheet our commercial property values increased by  million during the quarter the majority of this increase reflects the recognition of the final contractual  million payment on bay adelaide east as it nears stabilization in addition we had  million in valuation gains across the toronto and calgary portfolio as a result of higher terminal net operating income driven by reduced down time and improved rental rates and with  million in capital expenditures and leasing costs primarily in the toronto portfolio relating to the completion of bay adelaide east and the redevelopment at queens quay terminal on a square foot basis our portfolio is valued at  an increase of  from the prior quarter our average discount and terminal rate of  and  respectively remained consistent compared to the prior quarter our hold period remains steady at  years on average in addition to our commercial properties we incurred  million of development costs during the quarter at brookfield place calgary east which was funded through existing construction facilities our balance sheet remains in good shape with our loan to value level of  and our average term to maturity of our debt at six years which is in line with our average remaining lease term of eight years from a liquidity perspective we have  million of available liquidity and our next debt maturing at  queen street east of  million is not until december leaving plenty of time to explore refinancing opportunities on the operations front for the quarter we leased  square feet at an average rent of  per square foot which is higher than expiring rents of  per square foot and our market rents of  per square foot with that ill now turn the call back over to you jan jan sucharda thank you bryan with respect to the market update occupancy levels in toronto and ottawa experienced marginal improvements while calgary decreased slightly in terms of specific markets torontos downtown vacancy rate for all classes decreased to  from  in the prior quarter class a and aa space in the financial core experienced  square feet of absorption during the quarter resulting in a  basis point decrease in the vacancy rate to  momentum for the toronto market is expected to continue in the near term supported by expansionary demands and relocation aspirations for tenants currently located outside the downtown core we expect new developments underway and coming to market later this year to be absorbed without significant impact on overall market vacancy however the midtolong term outlook is unclear due to the recent announcements of two new developments that will add approximately  million square feet of new product between  and  box’s toronto portfolio vacancy rate remained at  at the end of the quarter in calgary overall vacancy in the downtown core ended the fourth quarter at  an increase of  basis points from the prior quarter as a result of negative absorption of  square feet class a and aa vacancy remained relatively consistent ending the quarter with only a  basis point increase to  head lease vacancy represents  of the  of class a and aa availability which translates to  of the market global oil prices remain volatile during the quarter due to miscuts to global oil production however prices are significantly higher than the depressed levels at the beginning of  and drilling activities have increased and capital investments have begun to rise the presidential permit approving the keystone xl pipeline by the trump administration as well as recently announced acquisitions by cenovus and cnrl should have a stabilizing effect in the marketplace box’s calgary portfolio vacancy rate remained at  consistent with last quarter our occupancy rate continues to be well above the market and we believe that our portfolio will continue to maintain an above market occupancy rate in the foreseeable future in ottawa the overall vacancy rate in the central business district decreased by  basis points to  class a vacancy decreased by  basis points to  compared to prior quarter boxs vacancy rate remained at  where it has been since the third quarter of last year ill end with a few closing comments our primary leasing objective remains to backfill voids and reduce rollover risk since we have minimal rollover exposure at just  in  we are focusing on converting new prospects and proactively addressing existing leases that are scheduled to expire in the next few years the trust average annual roll over exposure for the three year period from  to end of the decade is  average annual rollover exposure in calgary is  during the same period with respect to development activity we continue to make solid progress on the construction of brookfield place calgary east which has entered its final stage it is important to remind investors that brookfield place calgary east was acquired from brookfield property partners on an as if completed and stabilized basis where bpy retains development risk including the obligation to construct lease and finance the property the property is currently  leased in summary we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter of  finally i want to thank you for joining us on todays call if the going private transaction occurs this may be our last call and i want to thank you for your support please stay tuned with respect to updates on the going private transaction and the unitholder meeting which we expect to schedule in late june thank you once again and this concludes todays call questionandanswer session q  operator ladies and gentlemen
