pair in the box left and right heel rests brackets and mounting hardware sold separately shifter pegs footpeg heel rest is rated  out of  by  rated  out of  by enmascarado from they do the work nicely if you need something to rest your heels on your bike these are perfect  because of my bikes geometry i was having problems to rest my feetlegs while riding on the bike they seemed to be design for the foot controls i have nice materials the only fail are the bolts either they should come with pins and locks or buttonsocket head screws obviously stainless steel im going to be dragging the shift pegs i put on lets have fun date published  rated  out of  by dillybar from best foot rest actually heel rest but this item acts in conjunction with foot rest and makes like having floor boards easy to install but need to pay attention to the picture as well as the instructions when opening the package be sure to not lose the little black set screws adjust how you want your heel to rest on the peg before final tightening of the screw it also would have been nice if the bolts that came with the product matched the bolts that mounts the foot pegs star torx vs hex head but i can switch with the passenger foot pegs i also liked the adjustability angle i placed the heel rest in the upper position great quality chrome looks great too date published  rated  out of  by xlcrbob from excellent what a difference makes the ride so much more comfortable reduces the lean but im used to that having a lowered bike you wont be disappointed date published  rated  out of  by jbama from works works
