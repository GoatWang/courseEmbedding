invention field of the invention the present invention relates generally to automatic spray dispensers for releasing pressurized contents from an attached pressurized reservoir and more particularly to pneumatic timed spray dispensers which use as their sole energy source the pressure contained in the pressurized reservoir  prior art the most effective method of using some products such as insecticides and air fresheners is to spray quantities of the product into the atmosphere at regular intervals in practice these regular intervals are difficult to achieve with the manual valves generally supplied with the reservoir they have a difficult time maintaining a regular schedule of spraying a better way to ensure regular dispersals of the product is to attach a spray dispenser to the reservoir which will automatically periodically release the product once the automatic spray dispenser is attached to the reservoir the reservoir may then be placed in an advantageous location such as near the ceiling or in an attic or basement once properly positioned it can be allowed to operate unattended this ensures the product will get where it is needed when it is needed an automatic spray dispenser that is simple in construction effective in dispersing at regular intervals a fixed quantity of product and easy to manufacture would be highly desirable unfortunately dispensers that use electronic timers and valves are expensive and require an electrical current source heretofore dispensers which use reservoir pressure as their sole energy source have had problems more particularly many such dispensers were complex in design and difficult to manufacture another problem experienced with certain automatic timed spray dispensers which utilize the container pressure as the sole motive force is their inability to discharge substantially all of their contents still another problem of prior art spray dispensers has been their inability to maintain a substantially constant time interval between discharge these problems resulted from the manner in which the container pressure was utilized to dispense the pressurized contents one solution to this problem is disclosed in us pat no  the dispenser disclosed in that patent utilized a timing piston contraction that maintained a constant pressure differential on opposing sides of the timing piston although this design solved certain prior art problems the resultant discharged contents were not sufficiently atomized due to separation of the propellant and the active fluid in the pressurized container when not properly atomized the active ingredients form droplets which immediately fall wasted to the floor rather than forming the fine mist required for the product to be carried by the air and properly dispensed summary of the invention it is an object of the present invention to provide an automatic spray dispenser that operates solely on the pressure contained in the pressurized reservoir but that is effective simple in design easy to manufacture and inexpensive another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic spray dispenser having a direct exhaust pathway from the pressurized reservoir to the atmosphere a further object of the present invention is to provide an automatic spray dispenser which uses the pressure differential between two chambers to actuate the timing mechanism a still further object of this invention is to provide an automatic timed spray dispenser that discharges the contents of a pressurized container in an atomized form using only the container pressure as the motive force another preferred embodiment of this invention is to provide an automatic timing spray dispenser which utilizes as its motive force the container pressure to discharge substantially all of the container contents these and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the descriptions herein accordingly a spray dispenser

invention in one broad embodiment of the invention the spray dispenser utilizes a twosided timing piston fitted within a passageway of an elongated body so as to form separate chambers at the opposite ends of the timing piston each of the opposite timing piston ends will have different surface areas in this broad embodiment the chambers on each end of the piston are connected by a fluid metering device that can be formed as part of the piston in this manner the pressure drop across the fluid metering device remains nearly constant during the dispensing operation any dispenser construction that maintains a nearly constant pressure drop across the fluid metering device during the dispensing operation and which also permits a substantial portion of the pressurized contents to be discharged directly into the atmosphere in an atomized form would be within the broadest scope of this invention in the preferred embodiment of the invention illustrated in figs  and  the pneumatically timed spray dispenser comprises three basic parts which are combined with one another to provide a direct exhaust pathway from the pressurized container  to the atmosphere in a manner to allow a timed release of an increment atomized portion of the properly mixed gaseous propellant and liquid active ingredients in pressurized container  not including the various oring seals the three basic parts include a body  a timing piston  and a valve piston  to aid in the manufacture and assembly of the dispensing apparatus body  may be constructed in two parts lower part  and upper part

simply changing needle valve  for another needle valve having a different diameter passageway in an alternate embodiment the timing can be regulated by constructing needle valve  from a porous metal block even in this more preferred embodiment not including the orings the dispensing apparatus comprises only five separate parts which each are simple to manufacture also from a construction standpoint the most preferred embodiment also comprises a separate hollow exhaust tube  operatively connected to the lower body part  and the upper body part  to permit direct passage of the

positioned to provide an upper seal of timing passageway section c during the timing and dispensing stages of operation but to permit gases and fluids in timing passageway section c to escape to the atmosphere during the exhaust and resetting stages of operation in the preferred embodiment this positions oring groove  operatively connected with timing passageway section exhaust port  during the exhaust and resetting stages but not during the timing and dispensing stages of operation body wall section  along with upper shoulder surface  and lower shoulder wall  of upper body part  form valve

those two passageway sections a predetermined distance more particularly timing piston  comprises a first section  which will slide into both passageway sections b and c and a second section  which slides only into timing passageway section c first section  is provided with an exterior annular groove  that is positioned to face opposite oring groove  during the dispensing and timing stages of operation so as to break the upper seal of the lower chamber passageway section b timing piston second section  is also provided with an exterior annular groove  into which is placed oring  to provide a seal between the inner wall surface of timing passageway section c and the exterior wall surface of second section  this seal is maintained between lower passageway section b and timing passageway

timing passageway section c in the preferred embodiment illustrated needle valve  will be threaded in a conventional manner to allow fluid to flow between needle valve threads  and timing threads  and then into timing passageway  the diameter of timing passageway  can vary in order to regulate the amount of fluid flow and hence the timing between successive dispensing stages of operation needle valve  is sized so that the tip  of needle valve  protrudes into timing passageway section a valve piston  comprises three sections first section  is provided with a diameter that will slide into passageway section c the end wall  of first section  forms one end of timing passageway section c second section  is provided with a larger diameter than first section  and is sized to press against

forms part of passageway  into which valve piston second section  slides along the central axis of the antechamber  during operation upper section  also comprises a second section  which has an antechamber  which also forms part of passageway  and that connects and is aligned with antechamber  and into which valve piston third section  slides along the central axis of the antechamber  during operation extending from upper body end surface  and into valve piston passageway section d is valve passageway  one end of exhaust tube  is operatively connected by transverse valve passageway extension  to valve passageway  to permit the gases and fluids from exhaust tube  to vent to the atmosphere and to valve piston passageway section d this connection can be made by any known conventional manner such as a pressed fit mating threaded ends etc operation the operation of the dispensing apparatus is better understood by reference to figs  beginning with the timing state of the operation as best represented in fig  the dispensing apparatus is attached to pressurized container  by inserting discharge nozzle  through oring  in passageway section a in a typical pressurized container the discharge of the contents in the container is activated by pressing down on the discharge nozzle in these types of containers it will be necessary to provide a latching means to not only hold the dispensing apparatus to the container but also to do so in a manner which presses down on the discharge nozzle there are many conventional means which can accomplish these two functions one example would include a shroud  that has a threaded opening  which could be screwed onto the exterior surface threads  in body fluid receiving section  the shroud would also have a flexible envelope  that can be snapped onto the rim  of container  in a conventional manner in this embodiment as threads  are screwed into threaded opening  the tip  of discharge nozzle  will strike shoulder wall  in fluid entry passageway section a as threads  are continued to be screwed into threaded opening  nozzle tip  will be depressed causing the contents in container  to discharge into fluid entry passageway section a the contents will flow from fluid entry passageway a into lower passageway section b when the pressure builds to a predetermined level the contents will leak between needle valve threads  and timing threads  and then through timing passageway  into timing passageway section c because the diameter of the second section  of timing piston  is greater than the diameter of the first section  of timing piston  greater force will be applied to the top of timing piston  than to its bottom once the force differential is sufficient to overcome the frictional forces of orings  and  and any frictional forces caused by contact between the interior walls forming passageway sections b c and the exterior walls of timing piston  timing piston  will begin to travel toward passageway section a this time period is referred herein as the timing stage of the operation the dispensing stage of the operation is better understood by reference to fig  when timing piston  has traveled as far as is permitted annular groove  will be aligned with oring groove  when this occurs the seal between exhaust passageway  and lower passageway section b is broken the contents of container  can now leak between timing piston side wall  and lower body wall  this permits the contents to then flow into exhaust tube  the contents then flow into valve passageway  via transverse passageway extension  valve passageway  is provided with an exhaust orifice  that permits the contents to be discharged into the atmosphere this is referred to herein as the dispensing stage of the operation referring now to fig  the timing exhaust stage of the operation is described the diameter of exhaust orifice  is set to allow pressure to build up in valve piston passageway section d that connects with valve passageway  when the pressure is sufficient to overcome the frictional forces of orings   and  and the opposing pressure remaining in timing passageway section c then valve piston  will move toward fluid entry passageway section a until it abuts shoulder wall section  in this position transverse port extension  is aligned opposite oring groove  this results in the contents in timing passageway section c leaking between the wall sections  and  of valve piston  and lower body part  respectively so as to be discharged through central exhaust port  via the transverse port extension  the resetting stage of the operation is described with reference to fig  when the pressure in timing passageway section c has been sufficiently reduced timing piston  will now move toward valve piston  until it contacts valve piston  in this position annular groove  is no longer opposite oring  thus lower passageway section b is again sealed from exhaust passageway  the timing piston  continues to move and begins to push valve piston  until valve piston  abuts against shoulder wall section  when valve piston  abuts shoulder wall section  transport extension  extends above oring  permitting the operation cycle to begin again the sizing of the crosssectional areas of the lower passageway section b the timing passageway section c the valve piston passageway section d and exhaust orifice  depend on a number of factors included in these factors are the pressure of container  the desired time between discharge the nature of the propellant and active ingredients when these factors are known proper sizing of the crosssectional areas can be set in a preferred embodiment the following dimensions have proved satisfactory  lower chamber crosssectional area  in timing chamber crosssectional area  in valve piston crosssectional area  in orifice crosssectional area  in  when dispersing a pesticide with a fluorocarbon or a dme propellant from a pint container having an initial pressure between  and  psig generally about  psig there are of course many obvious alternate embodiments which are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the claims below one such alternate embodiment would include structuring the spray dispenser so that it could be fitted within the pressurized container  during the assembly of the container prior to the
