equity  hedge funds differences in forms and terms a new era of regulation for retail forex traders  brokers faqs sec noaction letters news   structuring private real estate funds forming a private real estate fund provides a means for the successful real estate developer to access a dedicated pool of capital to fund new investment deals without having to raise capital on a dealbydeal basis this article provides an overview of some of the key structural considerations related to the formation launch and operation of a private real estate fund   private real estate funds enable managers to pool capital without having to navigate the cumbersome securities registration process involved in launching an reit real estate investment trust or other publiclyoffered investment fund despite the relative ease of implementation private real estate funds are structurally complex and sophisticated investors will expect to participate on terms that not only align interests between the investor and general partner sponsor but that also reflect current market trends if you have questions about the process or costs to launch a private real estate fund or are ready to start a fund we invite you to contact us to schedule a complimentary consultation   entity types private real estate funds are typically formed using an entity that is either a limited partnership or a limited liability company both of these entity types are known as passthrough entities so that they are essentially disregarded for tax purposes and all gains and losses are directly attributed to the limited partners or members of the entity there has been a long standing tradition among private investment funds of using delaware limited partnerships or limited liability companies as the entity of choice however principals should be aware that the laws of many states may deem holding real estate for income producing purposes to be an activity that requires an entity to be qualified to do business in the state where the real estate is located in some states qualifying an outofstate entity or a particular type of entity to do business can be expensive in certain jurisdictions and might not be necessary if some advance planning is utilized more particularly principals should carefully discuss their investment strategy and implementation plans with experienced counsel and consider the benefits and drawbacks of using a particular entity type or jurisdiction for its formation   admission and withdrawal of investors since investments in real estate are illiquid private real estate funds have many unique structural issues that must be addressed an initial consideration is whether to use an openend or closedend fund structure many investors favor the openend structure which in the simplest form allows investors to enter and exit the fund at regular intervals determined by the fund’s sponsor however the illiquid nature of a private real estate fund’s investment assets often makes the openend structure unworkable since it presents the fund with the dual problems of establishing a fair value for each contributing and withdrawing investor closedend funds on the other hand cause all investors to join the private real estate fund at the same time removing the issues concerning the initial value of their investments and restrictions can be crafted to match investor withdrawal rights with the fund’s liquidity profile if managed properly a private real estate fund’s investment assets should appreciate over time and therefore many early investors would consider the participation of subsequent investors inequitable without some sort of compensation for that appreciation the difficulty comes in trying to determine the appropriate valuation for subsequent investors since formal real property appraisals may be the only way to properly assess the value of the fund’s investment assets the appraisal process is expensive can be time consuming and in some circumstances may not be available at all one potential solution is for a fund to utilize what are called “side pockets” a side pocket refers to an internal accounting system where investors essentially participate in a private real estate fund’s investment assets on an investmentbyinvestment basis therefore the valuation of the private real estate fund’s earlier investment assets is not at issue for subsequent investors because they will not be permitted to participate in the profits and losses resulting from the earlier investment assets meanwhile giving investors flexible withdrawal rights can cause significant problems for a private real estate fund it is very difficult to provide timely liquidity from investments in real estate assets because there are really only two ways to accomplish this objective one option is to arrange for the sale of the real property investment however several problems arise with this option including forced sales generally result in substantially reduced sale proceeds sales transaction can take a considerable amount of time to consummate there may not be a ready buyer for the asset or the asset may not even be in salable condition eg if the asset is a partially completed development project the second option is for a private real estate fund to leverage its real estate investments this option may not be particularly attractive or even available based upon the fund’s existing indebtedness and creditworthiness and whether the fund’s real estate investments are already encumbered current market conditions have also made the availability of debt financing rather scarce in comparison to prefinancial crisis market conditions additionally each of the two options mentioned previously can adversely impact the performance and risk profile of the fund for each investor that does not withdraw real estate fund sponsors should carefully match the liquidity of a private real estate fund’s investment assets with the withdrawal rights offered to the fund’s investors   if you’re ready to begin the process of structuring private real estate funds or you’d like to receive additional information regarding the timeline or costs involved in structuring funds schedule a complimentary consultation today   initial capital contributions and capital calls private real estate funds possess certain unique capital needs based on the nature of the fund’s investment assets most funds utilize a “capital call” structure where investors are required to make an initial capital contribution at the time the fund accepts investment subscriptions the remaining amount of each investor’s capital commitment is periodically “called down” by the fund the capital call structure recognizes that most private real estate funds will be unable to precisely time the closing of the fund and the full deployment of all of the fund’s capital the fund may also be making real estate investments where a substantial amount of time is required between the fund’s commitment to purchase the investment and the consummation of the underlying transaction or development activities are being undertaken and the fund is only required to make periodic progress payments on its investment asset not only is the timing of investor’s capital contributions critical to a private real estate fund’s ability to fund its investments the contribution of capital also generally starts the clock running on the “preferred return” that the fund will pay to the investors   allocation of profits and losses clawbacks return of capital most private real estate funds offer their investors a preferred return together with a split of the fund’s overall net profits the structure that specifies the order in which a fund’s profits and losses are allocated among investors and the fund’s manager sponsor is often referred to as the “waterfall” waterfalls vary widely in their structure and operation depending upon a private real estate fund’s investment assets and overall investor profile generally profits are allocated in the following order investors will receive a return of their capital contributions investors will receive a preferred return calculated on the total amount of their capital contributions while such sums are held by the private real estate fund the fund’s manager sponsor will receive an allocation equal to a portion of the total preferred return allocated to the investors usually in the same percentage as the profit split and referred to as the preferred return “catchup” or sponsor gp “catchup” finally the remaining profits are split between the investors and the fund’s sponsor while no fund can ever guarantee the payment of a preferred return investors are assured that they will receive the initial profits from the fund’s investment activities before the fund’s manager sponsor is entitled to any allocation of profits however there are a variety of ways to specify the calculation of a preferred return based on the timing of capital contributions or fund investments the purpose of including a preferred return “catchup” in a waterfall is to allow a private real estate fund’s general partner sponsor to have some participation in the fund’s profits so long as the preferred return has been allocated to the investors the catchup feature ensures that the profits resulting from a successful private real estate fund are allocated exactly in accordance with the agreed upon profit split and conversely the profits from a marginally successful fund will be primarily allocated to investors rather than the fund’s manager sponsor some funds will employ a “clawback” mechanism as a check against any overallocation to a private real estate fund’s sponsor group clawback provisions take many different forms but they generally serve as a contractual obligation of the fund’s manager sponsor to return any and all profit allocations it receives in the event that any investor does not receive both a a return of the investor’s entire capital contribution and b the entire preferred return on invested capital or the total amount allocated to the general partner sponsor over the life of the fund is greater than the agreed upon profit split private real estate funds can also differ from other types of funds in how and when capital contributions are returned to investors a private real estate fund sponsor must closely consider the fund’s investment strategy when structuring for the return of capital for example a fund that is focused on fixing and “flipping” real estate would likely prefer to retain the proceeds resulting from sale of early investment assets for future investment activity on the other hand there would be no reason for a private real estate fund focused on the development of a single project to retain investor capital some funds also choose to treat current income generated from the fund’s investment assets differently than the proceeds from the sale of the fund’s investment assets such that the waterfall for current income does not include a return of capital however it is important to keep in mind that the preferred return generally continues to accrue on all unreturned capital contributions and it may make more sense for the private real estate fund to return capital to investors at its earliest opportunity   if you’re ready to begin the process of structuring private real estate funds or you’d like to receive additional information regarding the timeline or costs involved in structuring funds schedule a complimentary consultation today   fees and expenses and related conflicts of interest as an investment type real estate is often susceptible to the imposition of many fees and costs some of which can appear to be duplicative or improperly allocated to investors in a private real estate fund real estate funds generally charge investors a fixed management fee based on a percentage of the fund’s assets under management to cover the manager’s costs of operating the fund general fund expenses are also typically factored into the overall net profit or net loss available to investors for example if a private real estate fund contracts with a thirdparty to serve as a property developer general contractor or property manager for the fund’s investment assets rather than utilizing the fund’s general partner sponsor in such roles investors may question the purpose or amount of the management fee certainly conflicts of interest may arise when a fund’s manager sponsor does provide development or property management services to the fund and care should be exercised to fully disclose any and all amounts that the fund may pay to the fund manager and its affiliates it is often helpful for a private real estate fund to consider a more customized compensation system for its general partner or manager in order to better align the interests of all parties more complex compensation structures include fullydisclosed acquisition development and disposition fees fixed limitations on total fees and expenses payable to the manager and limitations that provide that ancillary fees will only be paid from the fund’s cash flow when it is ultimately distributed to the investors in any case investors must be given detailed disclosure regarding any compensation to a private real estate fund’s manager sponsor or the sponsor group risks significant potential liability as a result of nondisclosure   operational considerations by their nature private real estate funds often reflect many of the characteristics of traditional operating businesses the sponsor’s principal managers and employees must consider numerous operational issues that generally don’t arise in the course of operating other openend private investment funds for example a private real estate fund must be able to provide for the development improvement property management andor maintenance of its investment assets real estate investments also encounter unique requirements for insurance compliance with state and local codes and ordinances and will usually be subject to property taxes and other ongoing taxes and assessments successful real estate fund sponsor groups plan for operational challenges in advance to allow the fund to achieve its objectives and return capital to investors   conclusion the process to launch a private real estate fund involves navigating a variety of structural complexities and business challenges presenting investors with an offering that is not consistent with current market imperatives will make the process to raise investor capital substantially more difficult in what has become an increasingly competitive environment for investor funds only those sponsors that take a thoughtful approach and present a coherent value proposition will succeed to build longterm value in a private real estate fund complex   ready to start a real estate fund if you’re ready to begin the process to start a real

documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet  about risk convertible securities risk the fund may own convertible securities the value of which may be affected by market interest rates the risk that the issuer will default the value of the underlying stock or the right of the issuer to buy back the convertible securities credit risk the issuer of instruments in which the fund invests may be unable to meet interest andor principal payments thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuers credit rating derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions developingemerging markets securities risk the prices of securities issued by foreign companies and governments located in developingemerging markets countries may be affected more negatively by inflation devaluation of their currencies higher transaction costs delays in settlement adverse political developments the introduction of capital controls withholding taxes nationalization of private assets expropriation social unrest war or lack of timely information than those in developed countries foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be affected by changes in a foreign countrys exchange rates political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulties when enforcing obligations decreased liquidity and increased volatility foreign companies may be subject to less regulation resulting in less publicly available information about the companies high yield bond junk bond risk junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer the values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of highquality bonds in response to company political regulatory or economic developments values of junk bonds can decline significantly over short periods of time interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise conversely bond prices generally rise as interest rates fall specific bonds differ in their sensitivity to changes in interest rates depending on their individual characteristics including duration management risk the investment techniques and risk analysis used by the funds portfolio managers may not produce the desired results market risk the prices of and the income generated by the funds securities may decline in response to among other things investor sentiment general economic and market conditions regional or global instability and currency and interest rate fluctuations mortgage and assetbacked securities risk the fund may invest in mortgage and assetbacked securities that are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that the borrowers payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are falling as a result the fund may reinvest these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing the funds income conversely when interest rates rise prepayments may happen more slowly causing the security to lengthen in duration longer duration securities tend to be more volatile securities may be prepaid at a price less than the original purchase value an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and could result in losses to the fund the risk of such defaults is generally higher in the case of mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages subprime mortgages refer to loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages preferred securities risk preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer in its discretion to defer or omit distributions for a certain period of time if the fund owns a security that is deferring or omitting its distributions the fund may be required to report the distribution on its tax returns even though it may not have received this income further preferred securities may lose substantial value due to the omission or deferment of dividend payments reit riskreal estate risk the fund concentrates its investments in the securities of real estate and real estate related companies investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic legal cultural environmental or technological factors that affect property values rents or occupancies of real estate related to the funds holdings real estate companies including reits or similar structures tend to be small and mid cap companies and their shares may be more volatile and less liquid the value of investments in real estate related companies may be affected by the quality of management the ability to repay loans the utilization of leverage and financial covenants related thereto whether the company carries adequate insurance and environmental factors if a real estate related company defaults the fund may own real estate directly which involves the following additional risks environmental liabilities difficulty in valuing and selling the real estate and economic or regulatory changes short sales risk short sales may cause the fund to repurchase a security at a higher price thereby causing the fund to incur a loss a short position in a security poses more risk than holding the same security long as there is no limit on how much the price of the security can increase the funds exposure is unlimited in order to establish a short position in a security the fund must borrow the security from a broker the fund may not always be able to borrow a security the fund seeks to sell short at a particular time or at an acceptable price the fund also may not always be able to close out the short position by replacing the borrowed securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price the fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling securities short in addition taking short positions in securities results in a form of leverage which may cause the fund to be volatile small and midcapitalization risks stocks of small and midsized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments and may have little or no operating history or track record of success and limited product lines markets management and financial resources the securities of small and midsized companies may be more volatile due to less market interest and less publicly available information about the issuer they also may be illiquid or restricted as to resale or may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes all of which may cause difficulty when establishing or closing a position at a desirable price as of  iarax nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually updated between  and  pm cst as of  yieldnbsp distribution yield with sales charge
