  all rights reservedi want to introduce to you the oldest brand the human brandits something you probably have not thought a lot about but on reflection you will realize that each personsappearance and style are her brand that personal brand conveys a lot of information to another person who uses it to judge status and sex appealfor women especially the brand is about beauty which is big business  the worldwide beauty business valued at  billion by  growing at an annual rate of  but the beauty business has some peculiarities its consumers are women all around the world but not men most beauty products are for the eyes lips and evening skin tone but not for the nose or ears  why is thatthe answers illustrate the hardwired nature of the human brandone common explanation for womens obsession with beauty is that the social and fashion media call her attention and that women would not ordinarily purchase makeup and cosmetics except for this social pressure the theory goes that women are taught from birth by social media the womens magazines icons of glamour and even their own mothers that buying cosmetics is a womans duty and requirement for a happy lifewe have in fact within our social memory a test of this hypothesis  the case study is the country of bulgaria bulgaria became a communist country after world war ii in   the autocratic regime imposed a centrally planned economy government planners who were almost all men made decisions concerning the availability of consumer goods including cosmetics  the choice of beauty products for most categories was limited to  supplied by the  main cosmetic companies  they were of terrible quality black and grey markets in smuggled or diverted goods were heavily penalizedfrom  the communist controlled media told the people that their basic needs were provided for  they were told that a womans concern with personal beauty and fashion was a remnant of her bourgeois consciousness that must be expunged this vanity of cosmetics message pervaded government publicity and especially the social media controlled by the government  at the same time women were encouraged by the same social media to join the workforce and study traditionally male trades  by  it was the only politically correct lesson that most women had heard in their lifetimes​then in  the bulgarian government collapsed along with the rest of communism immediately the demand for cosmetics and perfumes exploded significantly exceeding the growth of income of the people  between  and  the growth in sales of these cosmetics exceeded the growth in household appliances radios tvs and clothing  the number of perfumeries alone increased if the social media theory was correct it is hard to explain why  years of bulgarian social media could not dissuade the use of cosmetics among a generation of bulgarian women  a similar pattern appeared in china  following the liberalization of social laws in the s china experienced an explosion of aesthetic plastic surgery despite absence of any widespread media campaignwhat the histories of bulgaria and china teach us is that social media can follow and shape but cannot create fundamental human social drives  despite a generation of dominant media messaging that cosmetics were undesirable bulgarian and chinese women immediately returned to the pursuit of beauty the other explanation for the drive for beauty is rooted in evolutionary biologythis theory says that cosmetics are evolutionarily adaptive for women that is they contribute to solving a biological problem for a woman that improves her potential for reproductive success the theory says beauty is therefore hardwired in her genes  the beauty drive also arose very early in human evolution and spread with women as humans conquered the globe which is why it is universalwhat does reproductive success mean  humanity as a species has developed a survival and reproductive strategy our intelligence and omnivorous eating habits allow us to survive and multiply in nearly every ecology in the world  from about  people at our low point in human history there are now more than  billion of us worldwide  that is what i call successeach sex male and female also has a strategy for reproductive success  meaning producing the proportionately most number of children and grandchildren in the succeeding generations  that strategy includes advertising to potential mates and competing members of the same sex that you are valuable  we can call the display of these traits attractiveness or sex appeal it is quite remarkable that people of all cultures universally agree on what is attractive a metaanalysis covering  studies and over  observers found that people agree both within cultures and across cultures about who is attractive and who is not  men and women agree and people of all ages agree on who is attractive  this strongly suggests that judgments of physical attractiveness are hardwired in human genes it is simply not possible that these preferences are taught to people by culture sixmonth old infants gaze longer at faces that adults judge as attractive and spend less time looking at faces that were judged as not attractive this cannot be explained by the social media theory of beautypeople have different potentials for reproductive success this is just the natural variation in a population they display this variation in their body shapes and facial appearances  we call the variants with favorable features attractive  during human history we have evolved brain functions to detect and value attractiveness because these are signals of the most important feature to evolution reproductive fitness those who can detect attractiveness for partnering will be at an evolutionary competitive advantage for leaving his or her genes to the next generationremember our brains can sometimes prefer the signals of fitness not the actual fitness an example of this may be hair on the top of the head  ancient people noticed that this hair is attractive as a sign of fitness and those with more hair had advantages in life after many generations people tended to grow more hair on their head than anywhere else on their bodies  it probably doesnt contribute much biological function but it is globally a preferred signal and hair product brands do very wellso what are the features that make a person attractivethe sex hormones testosterone in men and estrogen in women largely drive the body and facial features people look for  the onset of puberty ramps up hormone levels and reshapes the male and female bodies  men increase their shoulder to waist ratios their beards grow and their jaw lines become more pronounced  for women breasts develop the hips to waist ratios increase and their jaw lines and facial features become softerwomen are so attuned to facial features of men that simply by looking at their photographs they can correctly rank order a group of men based on the testosterone level in their saliva  interestingly while a woman tends to prefer a man with high testosterone for an affair she prefers a little less testosterone for a longterm mate and her parents tend to prefer even a little less testosterone exaggerating the masculinity of mens pictures can actually make them less attractivebut people cannot get enough of the effects of estrogen  in a series of studies by david parrett panels of men and women were shown womens faces that were morphed to exaggerate feminized features  of men and women decided that feminization of womens faces made them more attractive  the same result was found for faces of european african and asian descent  another of parretts studies looked at women with varying estrogen levels during their menstrual cycle  women with higher estrogen levels had higher ratings of femininity attractiveness and health interestingly when the women put on makeup the correlation between estrogen and attractiveness disappeared  this shows that makeup literally makes up for lower estrogen levelsthis is the answer to the first question  why are cosmetics only for women because cosmetics accentuate estrogen driven female characteristics  one of my favorite reports was a recent study of tipping behavior in a french restaurant   male patrons gave tips more often to waitresses who wore makeup and when they did tip they gave them a larger amount of money than to waitresses without makeup  there was no difference for female patrons even though both male and female patrons thought that the waitresses were more attractive when they wore makeupwhat are the details of the human brand and how does our brain recognize themfirst the brain recognizes bilateral symmetry and body proportionsthe most elemental value in the human brand is bilateral symmetry meaning the left and right side of the body are mirror images of each other bilateral symmetry is a sign of the absence of congenital or developmental defect malnutrition or parasitic infection common maladies in subsistence living  people with poor health as children tend to look unusual or away from the norm by the time they are  years old although minor variations are often of no functional consequence they do have dramatic impact on the perception of beauty such judgments of the human brand are culturally universal men and women differ in body shape under the influence of the sex hormones  the preferred ratio of waist to hips for men is  for women who have wider hips the preferred waist to hip ratio is  once again this ratio for women is universal among all cultures that have been studied suggesting that this preference is genetically hardwired in our brainsthis idea is supported by one of the more interesting studies conducted by functional magnetic resonance imaging or fmri which images the brain while at work  this was a study of women who underwent plastic surgery on their bodies men were shown pictures of the women naked before surgery and not surprisingly distinct parts of their brains were activated  they were then shown pictures of the same women after cosmetic surgery had improve their waist to hip ratio to be closer to the ideal of   by comparing the brain reactions to the before and after pictures the study reported that approaching the ideal ratio specifically activated the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulated cortex  these two brain regions have been associated with judging value in choosing between alternativeswe pay special attention to peoples faceswe have a unique and welldeveloped area of the brain devoted just to facial recognition called the fusiform face area  as social creatures it is essential that we read other peoples intentions and emotions in their faces and adjust our behavior accordingly we also use the face to determine attractivenessin another fmri study men were shown faces of beautiful women while their brains were scanned  compared to average faces the attractive faces specifically activated the nucleus accumbens in the caudate region of the brain  this region is a reward center of the brain so we are built to reward ourselves with a little dose of dopamine when we make the right evolutionary choicethe eyes are a feature of the face closely related to beauty  the brain uses a special region the superior temporal sulcus for the job of following eye movements in others and determining the direction of their view  this region develops early and neonates learn within months to follow their mothers gaze  eye recognition is wired directly into the most fundamental emotional processing unit in the brain  the amygdalaso in summary the brain is built to monitor the symmetry and shape of the body and features of the face especially the eyes  in this way the brain is tuned to the human brandthere is one more driver of the human brand for your brain  and that is youthits common to think that this is a recent trend  in fact it is not  people are exquisitely sensitive to the age of others and are excellent judges of each others age our brain uses various facial cues to judge age even if we cannot call it into consciousness and express itthe reason youth is important is rooted in evolutionary biology  for women youth is a strong predictor of estrogen levels in all human cultures studied  the appeal of youth is not just a trendy preference but it was likely selected in our ancestors thousands of years agocosmetics are used to counter the loss of estrogen effects with aging  the prevalence of makeup use among western women rises from  in  year old bracket where estrogen is at its highest to  in  age group where it has already begun to declinethese evolutionary pressures to accurately judge age have focused our attention on estrogen driven traits that most readily reveal a womans age  in a comprehensive study of individual human facial features the analysis concluded that the most important factors in judging age are the size of the eyes and the lips and the evenness of skin tone regardless of what that tone might bein every ethnic group around the world the size of womens eyes decrease with age  they get smaller top to bottom in every culture  the same thing is true with lip sizeeye makeup which is used to increase the appearance of the size of eyes has the greatest effect on attractiveness as judged by both men and women  observers look at the eyes of women with eye makeup  longer than women without it and if the rest of the face is made up the attention to the eyes increased lipstick which increases the appearance of the size and accentuates the shape of the lip increases the time people spend looking at the lips by what about evenness of skin tone  when images of just a swatch of skin from british girls and women were shown to observers they were able to correctly estimate biological age their evaluation showed a strong correlation between judging someone as older and unevenness of hemoglobin and melanin distribution in the skin sample homogeneity was also correlated with increased attractiveness and appearance of healthiness for people shown pictures of both madeup and no makeup faces the number of eye fixations and dwell time were positively correlated with skin color homogeneitywe focus on the homogeneity of skin color because it is a marker of age  all people regardless of ethnicity get darker with age and their skin tone becomes uneven  the particular color changes that occur however differ among ethnicities  for example young african women have a strong yellow tone that declines with age while young chinese women have less yellow that increases with age therefore a yellow skin tone means beauty and youth in africa but aging and unattractiveness in chinamore importantly as people get darker with age the color contrast between the hair eyes and facial skin is reduced once again cosmetics are used to counter this sign of aging by enhancing color contrastwhy is there no makeup for the nose or for the ears  the simple reason is that the length of both the ears and nose continue to increase with age  these are the last features a woman would want to highlight because increased attention would indicate an older age  ergo no nose or ear cosmeticsthis review of the human brand also provides insights into neuromarketing neuromarketing is the convergence of evolutionary biology neuroscience psychology and genetics with economics and marketing the brain comes from somewhere and you have to understand human evolution and genetics to understand the brainyou cant do cuttingedge marketing anymore without understanding biologythe desire for beauty is hardwired in our genes and the genes then direct construction of our brains  it is global because all humans share a common descent  social media does not create beauty preferences but media follows the drives of evolutionary biologya great example of this is the lipstick effectclassical economists would consider luxury cosmetics as elastic goods whose demand would contract in difficult economic times of recession just like the demand for luxury homes and boats  but leonard lauder the merchant prince of luxury cosmetics first formulated the concept of the lipstick effect  he observed that sales of lipsticks increase during economic downturns as women choose small pleasures to compensate for losses and increase their appearance advantage in a more competitive environment a thorough academic study of recessions over the past  years confirmed his theory women tend to increase their purchase of products that enhance their appearance while decreasing their purchase of nonappearanceenhancing productsneuromarketing insights can help guide business through difficult cycles and create new categories of goods and services that are aligned with peoples hardwired desires copyright  dan yarosh all rights reserved view on mobilewhy luxury is valuable

is valuablestatus aspirations and selfsignaling create premium value in luxury consumers goodscopyright daniel b yarosh phd  all rights reservedabstractluxury goods are a significant portion of the marketplace and an aspiration for nearly everyone but we do not really understand why these goods carry a premium value i investigated this through a series of survey questions to more than  americans  the results show that these consumers are willing to spend both money and time to acquire luxury goods beyond their intrinsic utility and irrespective of the brand name  they value them in part because they help gain status relative to their neighbors and people readily understand that their neighbors may only buy luxury goods that they can show off surprisingly however luxury goods do not need to be displayed to the neighbors in order to hold value people regularly buy luxury goods for themselves alone suggesting that one motive for acquiring luxury is to selfsignal  the premium value of luxury goods is fragile and it can be easily devalued when placed in the wrong context or diluted by fakery these results provide new insights into the behavioral psychology of the luxury goods categoryintroductionwellknown brands of luxury goo​ds are potent forces in the marketplace in recent years new wealth injected into the consumer goods market has led to a bifurcation in consumer preferences they shifted spending to less expensive commodity goods while at the same time they increased their demand for premium priced luxury goods i  luxury goods are not simply the higher end of a continuum of consumer pricing more than  years ago thorsten veblen recognized that luxury goods convey the status of their owner to others whether or not they are superior in quality ii  they are signals of status and must be costly either in money time or effort to have value in conveying the appropriate signal  today luxury goods offered with luxury brand names and in luxury distribution channels have a value premium in consumers’ minds due to a perception of increased quality and utility iiithe behavioral psychology behind this perception of increased utility is not understood do consumers who are concerned about their own status value luxury items more than those who do not  are they more concerned about those above them or below them in social standing  what are these buyers willing to forgo in order to acquire luxury goods  is it important to luxury buyers whether their luxury goods are displayed in public what is the difference between men and women in their desires for luxury goods  these questions are addressed here using surveys of a large and diverse us populationmethodsa total of  people in the us were surveyed  the texts of the survey questions are found in appendix i  the surveys were conducted online using survey monkey see surveymonkeycom  the first survey of  people wasconducted in march  the second survey of  people was conducted in septemberoctober  and the third survey was of  people in january   the only entry criteria was that the individual was  years of age or older  survey monkey modestly reimbursed the responders for their participationthe participants lived within us predominately east of mississippi and a majority of remainder lived on or near the west coast  the distribution of residencies was similar among the surveys  the demographic characteristics are shown in appendix ii  there were approximately equal numbers of men and women in the surveys with slightly more women in the first survey and more men in the second  the subjects were predominantly over  years old but more younger respondents in the third survey ethnically white and had at least some college education  most were married but   and  in the three surveys were never marriedthe texts of the questions are found in appendix i  the questions were in the same order for all participants  the order of the answers was randomized except when the answers were about values money or time in which case the values answers were ordered from lowest to highest  values such as time or money were used to allow subjects to convey the intensity of their feelings regarding status of luxury goods  values were grouped in ranges eg     in order to calculate averages for the answers each answer was assigned the lowest value in the range eg statistical analysis was conducted using statplus for mac  the responses to each question were first analyzed by anova against the independent variables of sex age race white or nonwhite marital status single v ever married and education high school some college undergraduate degree graduate degree  if the anova had a p  linear regression analysis was used to determine which of the independent variables was significantly associated with the outcome  for those with significant association a chisquared test was performed for each pair of dependent and independent variables to determine the direction of the association  all pvalues reported here are the results of chisquared testsresultsstatus and aspiration are drivers of human behaviorpeople routinely overestimate their status and personal qualities relative to the rest of the population iv  in each of these surveys most responders said they were just as well off as their neighbors   and  in the three surveys  however they were more likely to say they were “better off” than “worse off” than their neighbors  v   v   v  in the three surveys  over all the surveys nearly twice as many said they were better off than worse off  v  this overoptimism was independent of race marital status or age as might be expected increasing education was associated with feeling better off rising from  among high school graduates to  for graduate degree holders p men tended to think they are better off than their neighbors compared to women  v  p  status is always relative to someone else and goods that covey status are considered positional because their value is dependent on their position relative to other goods in the same category  in a large survey in sweden people wereasked to make a recommendation to a hypothetical relative living in the future about living in one of two societies – one in which their income was high but smaller than the average the other in which their income was small but greater than the average  the study concluded that income was significantly positional ie people recommended that their relatives live where their income was greater than average v  here we asked people in the us in the first survey directly “would you rather have  when everyone else has  or would you accept  when others had ” contrary to the expectation of rational choosing more than half  preferred the  rather than taking  as long as they had more than others  the proportion wasindependent of sex age race married status or education  the decision was influenced by the amount offered compared to the amount held by others  in a second survey subjects were offered  when others had  or  when others had  – increasing the disparity from two to fourfold  the proportion now choosing  instead of  increased to  but the increment was not statistically significant  the result was again independent of sex age race married status or education  however in the third survey the subjects were offered  when others had  or  when others had  – greatly reducing the disparity  the proportions now reversed with  preferring the larger amount and only  choosing the  when others had   here the younger groups were even more likely than the older groups to choose the larger amount  for  year olds v  for  yr olds p  people choose by narrow economic analysis when the disparity with others is small but at larger disparities people’s feelings regarding the status of others influence their choicesstatus display and false signalsthe display of luxury goods is one means by which people signal their status to others logos are used by brands to conspicuously mark their goods particularly on clothing where the logo is readily visible  this can be an opportunity for deception since the observer cannot otherwise easily verify the brand or quality of the clothing  subjects were asked whether or not they would pay to have a false luxury logo sewn onto a free custommade shirt   chose to pay and of those who agreed their average offer was   there was no correlation with sex age marriage status or perception of status relative to neighbors  this significant portion of consumers who are willing to falsely display brand logos on clothing makes the true display of status more difficult this is part of the  “freerider” problem of honesty  symbols of status must be true and costly to convey their value  free riders will always try to falsify the signal and true status symbols must be enforced against free riders or they will ultimately lose their valueof special note there was a strong correlation between willingness to purchase a false logo and race  nonwhites were much more likely to buy the false logo than whites  v  p and nonwhites who were willing to pay offered on average more than whites  v   this may indicate that minorities within a culture are more eager to display costly brand signals as a way to show social achievement or membership in the majority group  there was also a strong correlation between education and willingness to pay p  the percentage willing to pay for the false logo fell from  among those with a high school education to  among those with a graduate degree  this may mean that increasing education increases the perception of the benefits of playing by the rules and the risk of penalty for detection of false signalsgifting and costly signals​gift giving may be a relatively private matter such as to newlyweds  however the amount may be influenced by the donor’s social status  subjects were asked when giving a wedding gift if they would give more less or the same as a neighbor who was better off  when they compared themselves to a better off neighbor  said they would give a smaller wedding gift  the result was independent of sex age marital status or education  whites were more likely to give less than nonwhites  v  pgiving to charity may be a similar or more public demonstration of wealth  subjects were asked whether when giving a charitable donation if they would give more less or the same as a neighbor who was worse off  when comparing themselves to a lesswell off neighbor only  would give less  would give the same and  would give more  this was again independent of all demographic variables ​these results are consistent with brain imaging studies that show that social defeats activate the emotional limbic areas ventral striatum and the insula much more strongly than victories and thus provides a salient negative reinforcer to social status loss vi  people want to give more than a lesswell off neighbor to maintain their status but do not try to compete with a betteroff neighborthis is an important aspect of the aspiration inherent in luxury goods  the desire is to be better off than most and hence the choice to have  when other have  rather than  when others have   the fear that is the other side of this desire is falling behind in social status  thus people are willing to spend more to avoid losing status than they spend to gain statuswhat is particularly remarkable in these results is that the decision is a private matter known largely only to the recipient and the donor but not the community at large that arbitrates status  nevertheless social standing influences these private decisionswe now consider how important is the public display of statusspending for status displayed or concealed goods​people purchase expensive goods to signal social status  subjects were asked whether they were willing to spend more on a purchase in order to surpass their neighbors who had purchased a similar item  there was a range of goods some of which are publicly visible displayed car or watch and some are in private places within the home concealed bedroom set refrigerator  the intensity of their desire to surpass their neighbors was expressed by the amount of money they were willing to pay  in each survey subjects were only asked once about particular goods  eg car or refrigerator so that all the possibilities were covered in two surveys​table   subjects were willing to spend more to surpass neighbor​​in each case between about  to  said they would in fact spend more just to exceed their neighbors’ purchase table   the proportions varied by the item with the greatest number spending more for a car and the least spending more for a watch  there was no difference whether the goods were displayed or concealed  the percentages were also similar whether the spending was to surpass a neighbor who was better off or a neighbor who was worse off  for displayed goods subjects’ intensity of feeling as measured by their willingness to spend was greater to keep up with better off neighbor than to keep up with a worse off neighbor they offered  less for car and  less for a watch to surpass a worse off neighbor overall the demographic factors were not related to any of the choices to spend more for displayed goods compared to neighbors with two exceptions  nonwhites were more likely to spendmore for a car compared to a worse off neighbor p and for a watch compared to a better off neighbor p for concealed goods the intensity of feeling was reversed  they offered to spend more to surpass worse off neighbor than they offered to exceed a better off neighbor they offered  more for a bedroom set and  more for a refrigerator to surpass a worse off neighbor  none of these choice frequencies were related to age sex race marital status or educationover a wide range of situations a substantial fraction of people consider spending more money than they originally intended in order to maintain or advance their status relative to their neighbors but they do not appear more likely to spend more for displayed luxury compared to concealed luxuryin a direct test of the desire to display status subjects were asked if they would pay a tax in order to display an inherited famous sculpture outside their home for all to see or forgo the tax and keep the sculpture concealed from the public within the home  an overwhelming  were unwilling to pay any amount to display the art the sentiment was unrelated to any of the collected demographics all these answers suggest that the display of luxury is not the only reason people spend extra for the prestige goods  to understand buying habits better subjects were asked if they had purchased a luxury good in the past month and whether others knew about the purchase display or not concealed  since the survey was conducted in january the trailing month included the christmas season this is in fact a time when people spend on themselves as well as gifts for others –  of consumers in  bought something for themselves during the holiday season vii  among our subjects  did not purchase a luxury good for themselves in the last month  of those who had  purchased an item that one no one knew about and only  purchased something that others knew about  the likelihood of a luxury purchase was dependent on age younger subjects were more likely than older subjects to buy items no others saw in addition the frequency of not buying any luxury increased with age p no other demographics were significantly related to purchasesthis result suggests people are more willing than expected by traditional behavioral economic theory derived from veblen to spend on inconspicuous consumption  to further explore this notion subjects were asked if they would prefer a more expensive luxury item that no one could see or a less expensive item that everyone could see  the question asked the subjects to consider giving up value in order to display the status good  in fact  chose to have the more expensive but unseen luxury good the choice was unrelated to demographics except for a small nonlinear but statistically significant effect of age ptaken together the results here suggest that people are willing to spend more to enhance their status relative to their neighbors  but they are not particularly concerned whether the goods are displayed or concealedinconspicuous consumption and selfsignalingthe finding of equivalent value of concealed luxury goods compared to those displayed is a challenge to the traditional theory of conspicuous display of costly signals as a demonstration of reproductive fitness  the category of concealed luxury goods includes refrigerators and kitchen items bedroom furniture and linens lingerie and luxury toiletries such as cleansers soaps scented candles and bath salts  current behavioral economic theory would predict that people would be less willing to pay for concealed luxury goods than displayed ones because they don’t readily convey status to others however the data presented here do not reveal a preference to pay for displayed goods or a habit of buying luxury more often for display  this same problem arises in the willingness of people to gift money based on status when few others will knowone explanation could be that people monitor their own actions to insure congruency in their behaviors viii “the ‘audience for individual’s symbolic consumption could be themselves”  hogg and colleagues propose in this congruency theory that people internalize social standards and choose products and brands in a search for intrinsic congruencein order to test this congruency theory subjects were asked about neighbors who displayed luxury items but held common goods in concealment  in the first survey subjects were asked to choose a single answer to the question you admire a neighbor who is always dressed with designer clothes drives a luxury car and wears expensivejewelry  you are invited to your neighbor’s home and there you see common brand furniture midrange kitchenappliances and drug store brands in the bathroom  you decide a my neighbor is a discerning shopper or bmy neighbor is a hypocritein the second survey subjects were askedyou see that your neighbor has a luxury car and wears a luxury watch but when you are invited inside his home you see he has common brands of kitchen appliances and furniture  you conclude your neighbor is a discerning shopper or b a phonyin the third survey subjects were askedyou see a neighbor has expensive luxury cars parked in his driveway  when you are invited into his house you see that it is barely furnished with simple furniture  you conclude that this neighbor is a a careful shopper or b a showoff in the first survey only  thought this person was a “hypocrite” in the second survey only  thought this person was a “phony” but in the third survey  though this person was a “showoff” in the questions using the term “hypocrite” or “phony” subjects’ responses were independent of any demographic feature  in the question using the term “showoff” men were more likely to characterize it as such than women  v  p softening the descriptive word increased agreement that this behavior deserved social condemnation but the criticism was far from universal and women were more reluctant than men to denounce the neighborthese results do not support the congruency theory  people are not quick to penalize those who are incongruous in displaying luxury publicly and concealing nonluxury goods but rather considered them “discerning shoppers” rather than “hypocrites” phonies” or at worst consider them “showoffs”a refinement to the congruency explanation is that people signal to themselves to reveal their true nature which is called “selfsignaling” ix  each person’s relative reproductive fitness is unknown to oneself at any one time but it is a subject of great personal interest  a person therefore does things that demonstrate to herself that she has high fitness value  it might be by being strictly honest or dutiful to parents and family by competing in a test of strength such as a marathon or by being especially vigilant against breeches of morality  whether others see these behaviors or not is irrelevant because the individual does see them and takes note of her own performance and hence sign of fitness value  a person can also signal to herself that she has high fitness by consuming costly goods that signal fitness such as consuming luxury goods whether displayed or concealed  she is in fact an audience of one for the costly signal event thus the signal has value whether it is displayed in public or concealed in privatethe selfsignaling theory explains why people are willing to give more in charity or wedding gifts to preserve status when few else know why people are equally willing to pay more for either displayed or concealed luxury goods in order to supersede their neighbors and why they are more likely to buy for themselves concealed luxury goods than displayed luxury goods  it also explains why they are not willing to give up value in the luxury good just to have it displayedpeople do not expect or require themselves or others to selfsignal there is no requirement for congruency and so they do not consider it hypocrisy or phoniness for other to only signal with displayed goods  the theory of selfsignaling better explains the results obtained here than more traditional conspicuous consumption or congruency theoriesdevoting time to luxury categoryluxury goods convey a value beyond their price as a display of status to oneself and others  the previous questions probed the willingness of subjects to pay for status  but the intensity of desire can also be measured by the willingness to spend time by waitingsubjects were askedat a store you are told you have won one of two prizes of equal value  one prize is two bottles of a common wine and the other is one bottle of a premium wine  the common wine bottles are available right away but you have to wait for the luxury wine bottle how long are you willing to waitthe choices are not at all up to  hour  to  hours up to  day  day to  week and more than  week   overall  are willing to wait for the luxury wine and  percentage will wait a week or more for luxury wine  the frequency of willingness to wait spans all demographics  there is no correlation with sex marital status how subjects viewed their status relative to neighbors or whether they preferred  or  in the status questionin a similar way subjects were asked about the luxury of fashion pitting the fast pace change of style against the willingness to spend time to get ityou win a contest and you can receive a white blouse from a wellknown manufacturer immediately or you can wait and receive a similarly priced blouse in the latest style in the season’s most fashionable color  how long willyou wait for the fashion blouse if at allin this case  of all people were willing to wait and  were willing to wait more than  week  there was no relation to any of the demographic parameters except sex  as might be expected from the question women were more frequently willing to wait  for women v  for men and more women were willing to wait more than  week  for women v  for men pthe results for this survey question are surprising  while other questions in the survey used money to express intensity of feeling these questions used time – the willingness to wait  as an indication of choice conviction  unlike spending money spending time to achieve goals such as the willingness to delay gratification is a characteristic associated with cognitive ability x simply the identification of the wine as a premium brand or the blouse as fashionable was sufficient to create substantial valuein a related study the same wine was identified to subjects as either a low price or high price variety xi  the subjects reported greater experienced pleasantness when tasting the higher priced samples and experiencegreater activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex the brain center correlated with rating pleasantness when tasting the higher priced sample  the identification of wine as premium or the blouse as fashionable creates a special value in the subject’s mind such that she is willing to wait long to experience it and will enjoy it more regardless of its intrinsic qualities  in this way a luxury good has a greater chance of finding consumer satisfaction than a commodity good and in a circular reasoning thereby justifies its premium pricethe relationship between time and value also works in the opposite direction  waiting itself creates value in the consumer good xii  in a study subjects who were asked to wait  days to make a decision increased their preference for a higherend ipod shuffle device  in this way waiting for a scarce luxury good increases its value and in a circular reasoning thereby makes its acquisition more salientpurchasing a luxury good is only not a binary buy or not decision but also a foraging decision about whether to buy or continue to shop the decision to continue shopping is also a form of waiting and the willingness of people to defer a purchase may differ between luxury and commodity goodssubjects were asked if they would buy or continue to shop if the found the watch they were looking for in the first store at the price they wanted  in one survey the item was a luxury watch and in the other it was a common everyday watchin searching for a prestige watch  said they would continue to shop even after they found what they were looking for  however if the watch was a common watch only  would continue to shop a statistically significant difference p  although shopping in general is an attractive activity to women and less pleasant for men xiii here in shopping for a luxury watch more men were willing to keep looking than women  v  p  however in considering buying the common watch age not sex was the factor as the age of the subjects increased the frequency of those willing to continue to shop declined pthe results here suggest that people place extra value in luxury goods as expressed in time time they are willing to wait to receive it and time they are willing to devote to finding itintrinsic value of luxury goods aside from pricea difficulty in studying attitudes about luxury goods is separating the feelings they provoke from their affordability  all people have responses to the offerings but they are only revealed when the personal circumstance of ability to pay is removed  this was accomplished in the surveys by endowing the subjects with skin care products through someone’s mistake and then asking them to return either the jar of luxury brand skin cream or an increasing number of drug store brand jars  the goal was to determine how much of a common good is equal to the value of the luxury counterpart putting aside the cost of the itemsthe question wasyou receive by mistake one package with a bottle of a luxury skin cream and another package with two bottles ofthe same size of a drug store skin cream you see on the packing slips that the two packages are worth thesame  the shipper asks you to return one  which do you returnno brand names performance claims or other descriptions were offered for the skin creams only that one was a luxury brand and the other a drug store brand  in the first survey the subjects knew that the two options were of equal monetary value but in the two later surveys there was no mention of pricein the first survey  would send back the  bottles of the drug store brand and keep the luxury brand  women were much more likely to make this choice than men  v  p but the choice was not otherwise associated with race age marital status or education the choice to send back the  drug store cream bottles was strongly correlated with those who preferred the  when others had  in the status question p  in the first survey where both questions were asked those unwilling to wait for the luxury wine were also more likely to send back the luxury cream than those who would wait for the wine  v  ppeople have a preference is for the luxury category that is relatively insensitive to the value of the other option   in second questionnaire the brands or values of the products were not specified but the subjects were asked if they would send back the luxury cream when the number of jars in the alternative drug store variety was increased  when  were offered  kept the luxury cream when  were offered  kept the luxury cream and when offered  jars of drug store cream  still preferred the luxury cream  although there appeared to be a trend toward fewer choosing the luxury bottle when the number of drug store bottles was increased it was not statistically significant  the findings were robust in the third survey the question was asked slightly differently so that the subjects were asked which they would keep one luxury or  drug store creams rather than which they would send back  in this case  still kept the luxury cream and women were even more likely to say so than men  v  pthe label of luxury on a product without brand name explicit performance claims or pricing cues created substantial preference in the minds of the subjects that was not easily dislodged even with an excess number of alternative itemsfragility of luxury category valuebrands are displays to oneself or others of costly signals of fitness and they should therefore be sensitive to the perception of their costliness  indeed making a prestige brand too easy to acquire can ruin its value  but once a luxury good has been purchased it becomes cloaked with an endowment effect xiv meaning the mere possession of something increases its value to the owner  the impact of endowment on the judgment of luxury value was explored by asking subjects about their desire for a luxury item after it has been publicly devalued but in one case before possessing it and in the other case after possessing itin the first case subjects were askedyou are on your way to the mall to buy a new pair of designer jeans you have admired  on your way you pass a thrift shop and the pair of designer jeans you had in mind is in the window  when you get to the mall are you a less likely to buy b more likely to buy or c no differencesimply observing designer jeans in a nonprestige context reduced their value  of subjects were less likely to buy the jeans after seeing them at a thrift store  this was independent of demographic factors other than sex  women were more likely to change their mind than men  were less likely to buy v  for men pin the second question subjects were asked about something that they already owned but did not invest their own money on – a sweateryou receive a sweater as a gift that you like very much and are planning to wear to a party  one day you see a homeless person wearing the same sweater  will you still wear the sweater to the party  yes or nohere the answer was different once the goods were possessed   of subjects said that they would still wear the sweater after seeing it on a homeless person  the answers were independent of any demographicthe answers to the two questions suggest an extension of the endowment effect to displaying luxury goods  prior to possession the ability of luxury goods to convey status is fragile and can be degraded by association in the wrong context  however once in a person’s possession the goods gain insulation from such adverse association  this observation supports the use of giveaway marketing techniques that put brand items in the hands of target customers and thereby endow the brand with value and immunizes it from devaluationdiscussionstatus which is the recognition of the inequality of people in health and wealth is one of the human universals found in every human culture studied everywhere in the world at every stage of economic development xv  people by their nature are optimistic about their status and the survey results presented here show that people are much more likely to believe that they are better off higher status than worse off lower status status is not just about how much money one has but also about what one has relative to others the surveys showed that  of people are willing to give up money as long as they have more than those around them  this desire for status was independent of the major demographic variables of age sex race martial status and education consistent with brown’s observation of the universality of status in human cultureluxury goods are one way that people acquire status  they are costly signals that carry a premium above and beyond the utility of the goods  a luxury brand name attached to goods increases their value in the consumers’ eyes beyond the contribution of the high price   among the survey population  were willing to pay more for goods just to acquire status by surpassing their neighbors  this was true whether the neighbors were better or worse off than themselves and whether the goods were displayed publicly or concealed inside the house  this was equally true between men and women and among races ages marital status and education levelsa particularly interesting facet of this desire for luxury status was the willingness of more than  of subjects and more than  of women to give up  bottles of a common brand skin cream to keep  bottle of a luxury brand even when they were of the same total value this expressed preference was not dislodged when up to  bottles of the common brand cream was offereda similar type of choice study was performed with monkeys and their brains were scanned using fmri while they chose they were offered either a small fixed amount of their favorite grape juice or increasing amount of the less favored dilute cranberry juice  as the amount of the less favored juice was increased in the offer the orbitofrontal cortex ofc which encodes the chosen value was increasingly activated  xvi  in a similar way the survey questions offered subjects an increasing amount of the less favored common brand as an alternative to the favored luxury brand  but rather than having more utility value sweeter taste in the monkey experiment the luxury cream choice had less utility value fewer bottles but more status value the later of which is encoded in the emotional limbic areas ventral striatum and the insula   in fact people who kept the luxury cream and sent back the  drug store cream bottles of equal value were more likely to be those who preferred  when others had  rather than  when others had   this suggests that these brain regions encoding both product value and status value interact when consumers contemplate the choice of luxury goods  this is certainly a testable hypothesispeople are willing not only to spend money to achieve status but also to spend time  spending time is different than spending money because lost time cannot be recovered later  in addition a relative increase in spending may be a driven by impulsive buying but relative increase in spending time by waiting is associated with increased cognitiveability  subjects answered that they were willing to wait for a luxury wine compared to a common wine and willing to wait for a fashion blouse which may be out of fashion later rather than immediately take a plain white blouse  this is a sign of status seeking those willing to wait for the luxury wine were also more likely to keep the luxury cream  subjects were also more willing to continue shopping and thus spend more time after finding the right luxury watch than after finding the right common everyday watch  this reinforces the finding that people will pay the premium value of luxury goods with not only money but with timecostly signals of status such as luxury apart from the value of the good are fragile  prior to purchase the costly signals in the wrong context such a status item in a thrift shop for the poor loses its “cost” and hence more than twothirds of subjects here decided not to buy  however once in a person’s possession the luxury good becomes endowed with value resistant to context even seeing the costly signal displayed by a homeless poor person didnot cause people to discredit the item  aside from the wrong context costly signals are subject to fakery that devalues its “cost”  this is not a trivial consideration since the survey here showed that more than onequarter of people are willing to pay a nominal amount to create a false signal of luxurythe theory of luxury as costly signals of reproductive fitness began with thorsten veblen’s formulation of luxury as conspicuous consumption  but since a substantial amount of luxury is not for display this theory was refined toinclude the theory of congruency or the desire of people to be consistent in their displays of status to themselves and others  however the alternative theory of selfsignaling proposes that people are concerned with their own level of reproductive fitness but cannot know it with any certainty therefore they use various signals to themselves to demonstrate their own value such as overcoming challenges or buying luxury goods  they are an audience of one and consistency in display to others is not required  this theory better explains the data presented here than the other theories on several pointsfirst subjects who purchased luxury goods for themselves in the previous month were much more likely to have made purchases that were concealed than displayed  this is inconspicuous consumption contrary to veblen’s formulationsecond most subjects were unwilling to pay to display a luxury good such as putting a statue out in front of their home this is again inconspicuous consumptionthird a substantial fraction of subjects were willing to pay extra for goods that exceeded their neighbor but showed no preference in their willingness for concealed or displayed goodsfourth a majority of subjects opted for the more costly but hidden luxury rather than the less costly but public luxuryfifth gift giving when few else knew was still sensitive to status  many subjects were willing to increase their giving to stay ahead of lower status neighbors but a vast majority was unwilling to do this to compete with higher status neighbors  if people think they are better off than their neighbors the theory of congruency would suggest that at least some would step up to signal it but they did not donating money activates the same area of the brain the ventral striatum which computes the utility of receiving or losing money and evaluates status xvii  the selfsignaling component of charity is consistent with the failure of pure altruism to explain giving  including the fact that even people with low incomes donate money to charity  glaser and konrad explain charity by an economic theory whereby the gift is a signal of wealth and status xviii  the donations proposed in the survey questions were without public attention and therefore only the theory of selfsignaling can explain the results described heresixth subjects were remarkably unwilling to condemn others who displayed luxury but kept common goods concealed  they were largely unwilling to consider them “hypocrites” or “phonies”  this tolerance for incongruent behavior is not consistent with the theory of congruency  but the theory of selfsignaling makes no requirement that subjects display their signals to others if they have made the signal to themselves​we can now answer the questions posed in the introduction  people desire luxury goods because they aspire to high status but they are more afraid of staying ahead than wishing to surpass those better off  these aspirations are largely universal independent of sex age race or education although there are some differences between the sexes based on type of luxury goods cars for men skincare creams for women  people are willing to acquire status by spending both money and time  the purchase of luxury goods to a significant extent is a selfdirected signal demonstrating status as an indication of personal fitness value  referencei    silverstein mj and fisk n trading up

application is a divisional of us patent application ser no  filed jun   which in turn claims the benefit under  usc §e of us provisional application no  filed jul   the contents of which in its entirety is hereby incorporated by referencefield of the inventionthis invention relates to the production of cpd glycosylases more particular in accordance with certain of its aspects the invention relates to expression of genes coding for cpd glycosylases in accordance with further aspects it relates to methods for achieving recovery of enzyme activity of expressed cpd glycosylases and other proteinsdefinitionsas used herein the following terms and phrases shall have the following meaningsthe word “protein” is used broadly and includes any molecule that includes a sequence of two or more amino acids connected together a “protein” thus includes without limitation a peptide a polypeptide a protein as conventionally known and a complex of peptides polypeptides andor proteinsa “cpd glycosylase protein” is a protein that binds to a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer in dna and produces an alkalinelabile site in the dna at the site of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimeran “alkalinelabile site” is a site which can be cleaved by alkaline conditions or by the cpd glycosylase or by another protein with apurinicapyrimidinic endonuclease activity to produce a dna strand breakas discussed in the literature for example see dodson and lloyd  it is currently believed that the glycosylase action of a cpd glycosylase is mediated via an imino intermediate between the cl′ of the sugar of the dna and an amino group in the glycosylase for typical cpd glycosylases a βelimination reaction then follows at the resulting abasic site causing a cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of the dnaa “stream mixer” is a mixing device wherein at least part of the mixing comprises  forming two or more flowing streams which may have the same or different compositions and  impinging the streams on one anotherbackground of the inventiona the cpd glycosylase dna repair enzymesdna repair is a function essential to every living organism a dna repair enzyme is a protein which contributes to the restoration of damaged dna to its native state see ronen and glickman  sancar et al  j a nickoloff and m f hoekstra eds dna damage and repair volumes i and ii  the types of dna repair enzymes found in human and mammalian cells generally are found in other organisms additional types of dna repair enzymes may be found in nonmammalian organisms such as photolyasesparticularly important dna repair enzymes are the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer glycosylases known as cpd glycosylases for example the cpd glycosylase product of the bacteriophage t denv gene specifically known as t endonuclease v has become an important protein with wide application in research and in emerging pharmaceutical products see us pat nos   the cpd glycosylases have a specificity for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in dna in which as currently understood in the art the glycosylase action is mediated via an imino intermediate between the cl′ of the sugar of the dna and an amino group in the glycosylase followed typically by a βelimination reaction resulting in cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of the dna as also currently understood in the art the protein releases the ′ pyrimidine of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer from the sugar of the dna hence the term glycosylase which creates an apyrimidinic site in the dna which is very sensitive to hydrolysis under alkaline conditions cpd glycosylases have been identified in many different organisms in some cases by purification in other cases by detecting the unique activity of this protein in an extract and in still other cases the presence of the protein has been deduced from the close homology of the putative amino acid sequence of the protein coded by a nucleotide sequence to known cpd glycosylase proteinsattempts to express the cpd glycosylase t endonuclease v in large amounts have been disappointing after bacteriophage t dna enters its e coli host the denv gene is transcribed to produce t endonuclease v only within the first  minutes of infection the first dna clones containing the denv gene were unstable lloyd and hanawalt  stable cloning of the entire intact gene has proved to be impossible because the nucleotide sequences in this region of the phage genome are lethal to the host and scientists have speculated that it is likely because the endogenous promoter is too strong for constitutive expression in e coli valerie et al a chenevert  in fact sequence analysis of the early gene promoters including the denv promoter shows that their consensus sequence is significantly different than that of the host consensus promoter sequence derived from analysis of  e coli genes liebig and rüger  these authors note that “strong promoters can be cloned stably only when one or several strong terminators of transcription are inserted downstream from the cloning site” pultimately the native denv structural gene was cloned by piecing together fragments of the gene without its native promoter valerie et al  radany et al  the sequence is listed in the national center for biotechnology information gene database as geneld  and it is the native structural gene sequence without the promoter that we refer to herein as the native denv geneonce cloned the native denv gene was placed downstream of various promoters in one case the gene was positioned downstream of the λ phage leftward operator and the rightward promoter olpr recinos et al  expression from the unrepressed promoter in a variety of e coli host strains resulted in t endonuclease v levels no more than  of total cellular protein growth temperatures above ° c and glucose levels above  inhibited denv gene expression although these conditions are ordinarily beneficial to the host cell growthin a second case the native denv gene was placed under the control of the e coli tac promoter whose expression is induced by the lactose analog isopropylthiogalactoside iptg chenevert et al  induction of t endonuclease v from this expression vector in e coli produced filamentation and cell death chenevert et al report that the denv protein was  of the total cell protein based on a single gel chenevert et al  fig  in connection with the development of the present invention more than a dozen fermentations at commercial scale showed that this expression vector is only able to produce t endonuclease v at about  of total protein see table  of example  belowchenevert et al also cloned the native denv gene under the control of the yeast gal and adh promoters however they reported neither the efficiency of expression of t endonuclease v nor the effect on cell growth in induced yeast chenevert et al  significantly they reported that the construct made wild type yeast more sensitive to uv not more resistant as would be expected if the expressed enzyme was compatible with cell viability valerie et al b cloned the native denv gene under the control of the yeast aah promoter and they found that the induced construct did not change the growth characteristics or cell morphology of the yeast host they reported that the t endonuclease was estimated to be “several percent” of total protein by scanning of a single gel valerie et al b fig  but this may be an overestimate since the gel is clearly overloaded with protein they found that the construct in uvsensitive yeast recombinants increased uv resistancethe native denv gene has also been placed under the control of a camv s promoter and transferred into tobacco plants lapointe et al  the amount of t endonuclease v produced in the plant was not reported as in the case of some yeast systems the construct increased rather than decreased the sensitivity of the plants to uv and alkylating agents ie the construct lacked dna repair activityattempts to improve t endonuclease v by changing the native denv gene nucleic acid sequence resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence have not met with success for over a decade the lloyd laboratory modified the t endonuclease v amino acid sequence either by recombinant selection or by sitedirected mutagenesis dodson and lloyd  summarized the effect of changes in the amino acid sequence on t endonuclease v activity none of the dozens of recombinants that were reviewed showed greater activity than the native denv sequence and many proved to be unstable in the cellother laboratories such as the henderson laboratory green et al  and the ohtsuka laboratory ishida et al  doi et al  hori et al  made numerous changes in the sequence of the native denv gene resulting in substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme all without significantly increasing the enzyme activity the single exception from the lloyd laboratory was a change in tyrosine at position  to a less polar aromatic amino acid such as phenylalanine see us pat no  this resulted in an increase in specific activity but only under conditions of low salt as these are not physiological conditions this recombinant enzyme has no therapeutic valueattempts have been made to change the nucleotide sequence of the native denv without altering the amino acid sequence but they have been unsuccessful the first attempt was to change two aua isoleucine codons nucleotides   to the auc triplet which did not change expression levels recinos et al  the ohtsuka laboratory constructed a synthetic denv gene they did not change the amino acid sequence but did change the nucleotide sequence for the purpose in their words “to introduce extra restriction sites and to facilitate enzymatic rejoining with dna ligase by avoiding selfcomplementary joining sites” inaoka et al  the gene was cloned under control of the trp promoter and after induction the amount of t endonuclease v was reported to be about  of the total proteinstandard expression systems for t endonuclease v or even inaoka et als system collectively systems which produce t endonuclease v at a level less than or equal to  percent of total protein are unsatisfactory for commercial purposes eg pharmaceutical purposes host e coli contain the hua protein that is very similar in size and charge to t endonuclease v and this protein contaminates preparations of t endonuclease v these contaminants are not sufficiently removed by standard purification methods used in industrial scale purification such as size exclusion or ion exchange the resulting preparations inevitably contain  huα contaminationthe commercial practitioner is thus faced with a dilemma it can increase purity by reducing the yield but this makes the product too costly for commercialization or it can increase the yield by reducing the purity but this makes the product unacceptably contaminated for pharmaceutical useb high expression and the production of inclusion bodiesin addition to the foregoing difficulties high expression of proteins in host cells causes the proteins to be expressed as inclusion bodies these are precipitated or coagulated accumulations of inactive proteins that are insoluble inclusion bodies therefore are lost to further purification and the increased production of a protein from an expression vector is of no value if the proteins are not recovered andor they are not in active form inclusion bodies are a significant problem for high expression vector systemsprior attempts to deal with the inclusion problem have included the use of high hydrostatic pressure to refold protein aggregates st john et al  hesterberg et al  this process is unsatisfactory for three main reasons  the process uses volumes that are fixed by the size of the vessel which is especially problematic in scaling up to commercial volumes because each increase in scale requires that a new vessel must be built and validated  the high pressure of the hydrostatic pressure method  psi is more difficult and costly to achieve and maintain than lower pressures and  the hydrostatic method still requires that the cells be lysed before processingas recently discussed by kathy liszewski in the oct   edition of genetic engineering news there is no universal solution to the inclusion body problem the approach by the current state of the art is to recover the inclusion bodies and attempt to refold them lieszweski quotes paul haney phd senior research scientist at pierce biotechnology as saying “refolding proteins can be a cumbersome and timeconsuming task since refolding conditions have to be optimized for each protein in order to promote formation of the native fold and to prevent protein aggregation there is no universal refolding buffer system” the solution thus must be found for each individual protein and there is no guarantee that a solution can be foundc summary of the state of the artas shown by the history of the cloning of t endonuclease v set forth above and as discussed by dr claes gustafsson in genetic engineering news  the design of expression vectors is not at all an exact or routine undertaking consequently high expression vectors for cpd glycosylases and in particular for t endonuclease v ie expression vectors capable of producing the protein at levels equal to or greater than  of cellular protein have not existed in the art alterations in the amino acid sequence have failed to increase yield or activity of t endonuclease v similarly alterations in the nucleotide sequence coding for t endonuclease v have not produced significantly increased yield or activitythe real and perceived barriers to high expression and recovery of cpd glycosylases have been the art has not recognized that nucleotide sequences for cpd glycosylases have been optimized by evolution for expression at low levels consistent with the other functions of the cell for example the denv gene sequence has been optimized by evolution for the fastest and highest level of expression only during the early phase of phage t infection and for shutdown thereafter the art has erroneously believed that high levels of cpd glycosylases eg t endonuclease v cannot be achieved because supposedly such levels are lethal to the cell eg e coli  proteins expressed at high levels typically form inclusion bodies which are insoluble and inactive and the art has not developed efficient and economical techniques for recovering activity from proteins in inclusion bodies and in particular recovering dna repair activity from cpd glycosylase proteins in inclusion bodiessummary of the inventionfor ease of presentation the aspects of the invention relating to dna coding will be discussed in terms of a set of “rules” table  contains what are designated as “prior art rules” since they have been previously employed to optimized dna sequences for expression in for example e coli table  contains two groups of codons that are used in what will be referred to herein as the “codon selection rules” the codon selection rules state in designing a recombinant cpd glycosylase gene for a cpd glycosylase protein use at least one codon from group a for more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein and at least one codon from group b for more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein andor in designing a recombinant cpd glycosylase gene for a cpd glycosylase protein use at least two codons from group a for more than  preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein and at least two codons from group b for more than  preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein andor in designing a recombinant cpd glycosylase gene for a cpd glycosylase protein use at least three codons from group a for more than  preferably more than  most preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein and at least three codons from group b for more than  preferably more than  most preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the proteinin certain preferred embodiments both the prior art rules and the codon selection rules are used with the codon selection rules taking precedence over the prior art rules in the case of a conflict between the two sets of rulesin accordance with a first aspect the invention thus provides an isolated synthetic andor recombinant polynucleotide which employs the codon selection rules in particular the invention provides an isolated synthetic andor recombinant polynucleotide comprising a a nucleotide sequence encoding a cpd glycosylase protein andorb a complement of the nucleotide sequence wherein the complement and the nucleotide sequence consist of the same number of nucleotides and are  complementary wherein i groups a and b represent the following codons for the following amino acidsamino acidcodongroup atyrosinetac glycineggt valinegtt serinetct alaninegct or gca group bisoleucineatc phenylalaninettc aspartic acidgac histidinecac and ii the nucleotide sequence comprises a at least one codon from group a for more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the cpd glycosylase protein and at least one codon from group b for more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the cpd glycosylase protein andorb at least two codons from group a for more than  preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the cpd glycosylase protein and at least two codons from group b for more than  preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the cpd glycosylase protein andorc at least three codons from group a for more than  preferably more than  most preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the cpd glycosylase protein and at least three codons from group b for more than  preferably more than  most preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the cpd glycosylase protein in accordance with a second aspect the invention provides a cell comprising a cpd glycosylase protein wherein the cpd glycosylase protein comprises at least  weight percent of the total protein of the cell in accordance with this aspect the level of cpd glycosylase protein can be determined by obtaining a sample of a culture of the cells washing the cells to remove the growth medium and then determining the total protein content of the cells and the cpd glycosylase protein typically the  weight percent level will be achieved towards the end of the fermentation processin the case of cells that are engineered to excrete the cpd glycosylase protein the weight percent in the cells may be lower than in cells which retain the protein in the case of such excreting cells as well as cells that do not excrete or do not substantially excrete the invention in accordance with a third aspect provides a culture of cells that produces a cpd glycosylase protein wherein for at least one period of at least ten minutes at least  weight percent of the total protein produced by the culture during the period is the cpd glycosylase proteinin accordance with a fourth aspect the invention provides a method for producing a cpd glycosylase protein comprisinga culturing cells which produce the cpd glycosylase protein andb collecting the cpd glycosylase proteinwherein the cpd glycosylase protein comprises at least  weight percent of the total protein produced by the cells during step ain accordance with a fifth aspect the invention provides a method for producing a protein eg a cpd glycosylase protein comprisinga culturing cells which produce the protein at least some of said protein being in inclusions bodies andb collecting the proteinwherein in step b at least part of the protein produced by the cells in step a is subjected to a mixing process that comprises i forming two or more flowing streams at least one of which contains inclusion bodies which contain the protein and ii impinging the streams on one another to disrupt at least some of the inclusion bodiesin accordance with these aspects of the invention the at least one flowing stream which contains the protein can contain intact cells disrupted cells or combinations thereofin certain embodiments of this aspect of the invention at least one of the flowing streams has a velocity v prior to the impingement and the impingement produces a stream that has a velocity v where v minus v is greater than or equal to  meterssecond for example at least one of the flowing streams can have a velocity greater than or equal to  meterssecond eg a velocity of at least  meterssecond prior to the impingement and the impingement can produce a stream that has a velocity which is less than  meterssecond eg a velocity of approximately  metersecond as a specific example two flowing streams each having a velocity greater than or equal to  meterssecond prior to the impingement can form a single stream as a result of the impingement that has a velocity which is less than  meterssecond other stream configurations can be used as desired eg the two or more flowing streams can form more than one stream after the impingementalthough not wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operation it is believed that stream mixing of a solution containing bacteria causes the bacteria to collide and break apart and in addition causes inclusion bodies of coagulated protein within the bacteria to also collide and break apart resulting in solubilization of the protein contained in the inclusion bodies if the bacteria are disrupted prior to stream mixing the stream mixer no longer needs to break up the bacteria but still serves to break up and thus solubilize the protein contained in inclusion bodiesif the stream mixing is performed on intact cells microscopic examination of the solution resulting from the mixing will preferably reveal no intact bacterial cells as to inclusion bodies if a solution produced by stream mixing is centrifuged to remove insoluble components the supernatant will preferably contain at least  more preferably at least  of the protein contained in inclusion bodies prior to stream mixing as a specific example such centrifugation can be performed for  minutes using a beckman avanti j centrifuge equipped with a jla  rotor and operating at  rpm which produces ×g or with equivalent equipmentthe stream mixing aspects of the invention are preferably used with cpd glycosylases but can also be used with other proteins such other proteins preferably have molecular weights of less than  daltons ie they contain less than about  amino acids such relatively small proteins have limited numbers of three dimensional configurations and thus when acted upon by the stream mixing process have a high likelihood of refolding into their native configuration enzymes are typical examples of such small proteins as specific examples stream mixing has been found to successfully recover active enzyme from inclusion bodies containing oxoguanine glycosylase ogg as well as inclusion bodies containing photolyase from anacystis nidulans see example  belowadditional features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the detailed description which follows and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from that description or recognized by practicing

subfamiliesall the members of the cpd glycosylase family share the same unique activity in the dna repair process but they can be separated into two subfamilies based on their amino acid sequence homology relative to one or the other of two archetypal enzymes t endonuclease v and micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease the members of the family and subfamilies are not as easily recognized by comparing the nucleotide sequences because of the degeneracy of the genetic code ie an organisms preference for at or gc base pairing in the third position of the codon significantly distorts the nucleic acid sequence similarities even when the amino acid sequences are quite similarthe first subfamily which is closely related to t endonuclease v includes the cpd glycosylases from the following organisms and their related strains bacteriophage rb paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  prochlorus marinus bordetella parapertussis haemophilus ducreyi brucella meliensis and pasteurella multocida the second subfamily which is more closely related to micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease includes the cpd glycosylases from the following organisms and their related strains nitrosomonas europeaea and azoarcus sp ebnthe similarity to one or the other of the archetypal cpd glycosylases can be determined by aligning the amino acid sequences the homologies are not exact and gaps are therefore introduced to align the amino acid sequences for clarity in discussing amino acid sequence homologies and similarities the amino acids for both subfamilies are numbered based on the t endonuclease v archetypal sequence for example homology at amino acid  refers to the th amino acid in the t endonuclease v sequence although it may actually be the th or the th or some other amino acid in a particular protein sequence of either subfamilythe alignment may be performed manually but it is preferably performed by computational analysis using for example the smithwaterman algorithm waterman in general the aligned sequences of the cpd glycosylases show more homology at the amino and carboxy ends than in the middle of the protein the homology between the two archetypes of the cpd glycosylases t endonuclease v and micrococcus luteus uv endonuclease is   of  possible amino acid matches as for the specific homologies between the archetypal cpd glycosylases it should be noted that four amino acid residues previously proposed as functionally important in the t endonuclease v enzyme arginine at position  arginine at position  glutamic acid at position  and lysine at position  are all conserved in the micrococcus luteus sequence shiota and nakayama the members of the first subfamily homologous with archetypal t endonuclease v share homology at the  amino acids shown in table  some of which have been associated with the biological activity of the protein in addition the family shares a sequence similarity between amino acids  and  which is a region thought to be important for substrate binding although the sequence is not identical for all members of the subfamily the choice of amino acids at each position is usually between two or in one case among four the sequence is described in table  second columnthe second subfamily homologous with archetypal m luteus uv endonuclease also shows a sequence similar to the first group between amino acids  and  see the third column of table  as can also be seen in this table the two subfamilies have homology or similarity at amino acid positions    and the cpd glycosylase which has the least homology to its archetypal enzyme is from pasteurella which nevertheless shares   of  amino acids with t endonuclease v in particular it shares the  conserved amino acids of the t endonuclease v subfamily listed in table  thus in general cpd glycosylases are proteins which after alignment share at least  homology with either the t endonuclease v archetype or the m luteus archetypeb codon usage in native cpd glycosylase genesin accordance with the invention a set of aversions negative preferences regarding codon usage for certain amino acids has been discovered in the native genes for the cpd glycosylases in particular nine amino acid codons divided into two groups are subject to these aversions group a consisting of tyrosine glycine valine serine and alanine and group b consisting of isoleucine phenylalanine aspartic acid and histidine for these amino acids nature has an aversion for using a codon from group a and a codon from group b for more than  of the occurrences of those amino acidsthe codon usage for these nine amino acids for all of the known cpd glycosylase genes is shown in table  in the instance of some of the cpd glycosylase genes such as the cpd glycosylase gene from phage rb at least one codon from group a is used more than  of the instances of that amino acid but no codon from group b is used at more than that frequency in other cases such as the cpd glycosylase gene from micrococcus luteus none of the codons from group a are used over  of the instances of that amino acid but at least one codon from group b is used over  of the instances of that amino acid it is impossible to know why nature has developed these aversions but based on the present invention one might speculate that they evolved as a mechanism to limit efficient translation of the transcript of cpd glycosylase genes so that this protein does not become an unnecessarily large portion of the total protein of a cellc codon selection rulesas discussed above in the summary of the invention in accordance with certain aspects of the invention it has been discovered that codon usage for cpd glycosylases should follow at least one of three codon selection rules namely in designing a recombinant cpd glycosylase gene for a cpd glycosylase protein use at least one codon from group a for more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein and at least one codon from group b for more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein andor in designing a recombinant cpd glycosylase gene for a cpd glycosylase protein use at least two codons from group a for more than  preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein and at least two codons from group b for more than  preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein andor in designing a recombinant cpd glycosylase gene for a cpd glycosylase protein use at least three codons from group a for more than  preferably more than  most preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the protein and at least three codons from group b for more than  preferably more than  most preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the proteinthe use of these codon selection rules has been found to result in expression of polynucleotide sequences for cpd glycosylases at levels that are useful for commercial productioncertain embodiments of the invention follow the approach of designing a recombinant cpd glycosylase gene for a cpd glycosylase protein by using all codons from groups a and b for more than  preferably more than  most preferably more than  of the occurrences of the amino acid coded by the codon in the proteinthese approaches to codon selection ameliorate the limitations on expression of cpd glycosylases resulting from the evolutionary optimization of the nucleotide sequences for these proteins that has resulted in expression at low levels consistent with the other functions of the celld prior art rulesthe art has developed rules for modifying codons in exogenous genes to optimize expression in e coli an example of which is the primo  program available from chang bioscience inc the preferred codon usage rules of the prior art for e coli are shown in table  similar rules exist for other hoststhe present invention makes use of these prior art rules except where they conflict with the codon selection rules of the invention in the cases of conflict the codon selection rules of the invention take precedence unless those rules would lead to tandem duplication of a codon in which case the prior art rule will be used to avoid such a tandem duplication see for example amino acid  of fig be application of the codon selection rules to the native denv gene and other cpd glycosylasesin certain of its preferred embodiments the present invention relates to methods for preparing a recombinant version of the nucleotide sequence for a cpd glycosylase protein eg the native denv gene without altering the amino acid sequencefig  shows a specific application of these embodiments to the t endonuclease v enzyme which is currently a dna repair enzyme commercially sold and widely used in particular this figure shows the nucleotide sequences of the native denv gene seq id no  and a recombinant denv gene designed in accordance with the prior art rules seq id no  and the codon selection rules of the invention seq id no  the amino acid sequence of t endonuclease v seq id no  is also shown and this is unchanged by the coding of the recombinant gene in particular amino acid  is tyrosine and is not changed as described in us pat no the changes in the recombinant gene seq id no  are shown in fig  on the line marked “agi” these changes are contrasted with the changes made in the synthetic denv gene of inaoka shown on the line marked “inaoka” seq id no  it is clear that the agi and inaoka genes seq id no  and seq id no  share very few changes this is because the inaoka changes were made for purposes of introducing restriction sites in the nucleotide sequence and the agi changes of the present invention were made for enhancing gene expressionin designing the recombinant denv gene sequence special conditions of phage t gene expression were considered when phage t infects a cell it destroys the e coli trna that pairs to the ctg codon for leucine translation this infection tactic reduces the transcription of host genes the phage t genes avoid this problem by using alternate codons for leucine such as tta or ttg in addition when phage t infects a cell it produces trna for codons in low abundance in e coli and it also includes these rarely used codons in the denv gene this infection tactic serves to divert translation to phagespecific proteins such as t endonuclease v however in the situation of the native denv gene expressed from a plasmid translation of these rarely used codons without the supplemental phage trnas for these codons is suboptimalin table  the codon usage in the native t endonuclease v gene is contrasted with the most preferred codon usage directed by the present invention in the recombinant t endonuclease v gene as can be seen in this table in accordance with the most preferred embodiments of the invention codon usage has been changed so that codons from group a are used more than  of the time and in addition codons from group b are also used more than  of the timeoverall  of the  amino acid codons are changed in the native denv gene sequence by either the rules of the prior art or those of the present invention of these  changes  changes are different between the rules of the invention and those of the prior artthe present invention also directs the use of codons that differ from the native sequence or those instructed by the prior art when the denv gene is expressed in other hosts such as yeast or the plant arabidopsis that is the codon selection rules described above apply equally when the denv gene is expressed in hosts other than e coli similarly the present invention directs the use of codons that differ from the native sequence or those instructed by the prior art when other dna repair genes such as the e coli ada gene for repair of omethylguanine or the arabidopsis ogg gene for repair of oxoguanine is expressed in e coli or in other hosts again the codon selection rules described above are applied for these other proteinhost combinationsthus the rules of the present invention provide general guidance for the use of different and nonobvious codons in designing genes for enhanced expression of a variety of dna repair genes in a variety of hostsfor any given dna repair enzyme or more specifically any cpd glycosylase the protein and thus its dna sequence may be shortened or truncated to increase its stability without changing its enzymatic specificity or it may contain within the final protein the full length of the native amino acid sequence for example the protein may be truncated to remove the endonuclease or βelimination activity since this activity may be provided by either other nondnadamage specific enzymes or by nonenzymatic cleavage of the dna the cpd glycosylase may be grafted to or combined with another protein to form a chimera with added binding specificity andor specificities or to bring two or more activities closer together in space additional amino acids or other modifications may be added to direct localization to the nucleus mitochondria or other organelles in order to direct dna repair to these sites additional amino acids or other modifications may be added to the protein to simplify purification such as adding a peptide sequence that binds with high affinity to a ligand that can be attached to a solid support the present invention includes these and other changes to the amino acid sequences for cpd glycosylases and nucleotide sequences coding for those proteins now known or subsequently developedf expression systemsother than for the codon selection rules discussed above nucleic acid synthesis cloning and expression of the cpd glycosylases follows standardconventional techniques now known or subsequently developed in the art extensive reviews of such techniques can be found in such texts as molecular cloning a laboratory manual vol iiii eds j sambrook e f fritsch t maniatis for example in the case of the recombinant denv gene the recombinant nucleotide sequence can be placed adjacent to and under the control of an e coli promoter the promoter and structural gene can then be cloned into a plasmid with a selectable marker so that only bacteria with the intact plasmid grow in the fermentation conditionsany suitable host may be used as long as the promoter for the recombinant sequence is compatible with the host transcription and translation metabolism some host strains may be found to express the gene more efficiently than do others see for example example  belowmany types of media may also be used for fermentation of the host including minimal media with defined components and enriched media containing extracts of yeast and digested proteins the expression vectors may be induced by addition of the appropriate inducing agent which can be a chemical such as isopropylthiogalactoside or larabinose or a change in physical conditions such as temperature or dissolved oxygen the inducer may be present during all phases of growth or it may be added after the culture has progressed to a desired phase of growththe particular conditions to be used for any particular cpd glycosylasehost combination can be readily determined from the current disclosure and the general knowledge in the art of genetic engineeringg determination of levels of protein productionthe protein production of a culture of cells may be determined by various techniques known in the art for example protein production can be determined by sampling the culture at intervals of for example  minutes during fermentation and subjecting the proteins in the sample to sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with coomassie the fraction of cpd glycosylase in total cell protein can be determined by for example densitometry scanning of the stained gel the total cell protein can be determined by for example summing the densities of all the bands subtracting out any bands contributed by the media which is determined from a lane loaded with media alone in the gel the identity of the cpd glycosylase band can for example be determined by including in the gel a standard of purified cpd glycosylase and the cpd glycosylase amount can be determined by for example the density of its band for each time point sample the fraction of total protein can be determined by for example dividing the density of the cpd glycosylase band by the sum of the densities of the total cell proteins the rate of protein production by percent of total protein can be determined by for example comparing the results from two samples collected  minutes apart and calculating the change in the density of the cpd glycosylase band density divided by the change in the sum of the densities of the total cell protein the resulting fraction times  is then the weight percent of the cpd glycosylase protein produced by the culture during the  minute period relative to the total protein produced by the culture during that periodas another alternative the percentage of protein synthesis during a  minute period that is cpd glycosylase synthesis can also be determined by the “pulsechase” labeling technique which is well known to protein chemists in this protocol a cell sample is exposed to a radiolabeled amino acid for ten minutes the “pulse” the labeled amino acid is one which is present in essentially all protein such as smethionine the cells are washed with a buffer solution to remove the isotope and finally incubated with a unlabeled amino acid the “chase” for an additional  minutes the cells are collected and the proteins separated by sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the gel is imaged using xray film or a phosphorescence imager and all the proteins that were made during the  minute pulse period appear in the image because of the radiolabel the intensity of the cpd glycosylase band divided by the intensity of the sum of all the proteins is the percentage of protein synthesis during a  minute period that is cpd glycosylaseh recovery of cpd glycosylase activityfollowing fermentation the cells may be collected from the cell culture media by any of several methods including fixed volume or continuous flow centrifugation or filtration the cells to be processed may be in a form of a dry power produced by lyophilization or as a moist powder referred to as paste the cells may then be dispersed in liquid at a concentration of between for example  and  grams per liter and the liquid may be any suitable buffer or water the mechanism of dispersion may be by many methods including an overhead mixer with a paddle or marine impeller and the duration of mixing may be for example  minutes or longer at for example refrigerated to room temperature in cases of cells that are expected to be particularly difficult to disrupt the dispersion process can include methods to enhance subsequent cell lysis such as adding to the dispersion medium a lysing agent like lyoszymealternatively an expression vector in combination with an appropriate host can be used whereby the highly expressed protein is secreted out of the cells and into the media in this case recovery of the protein simply involves removal of the cells and collection of the culture mediahigh levels of protein expression often lead to the formation of inclusion bodies such bodies may be contained within the host cells andor may be found in the culture medium many methods have been used to recover protein andor protein activity from inclusion bodies but all of these methods eg those methods which use high concentrations of guanidine chloride produce denatured protein as an intermediate as a result recovery of protein andor activity from inclusion bodies has required an additional step of removal of the denaturing agent in order to allow refolding of the protein in accordance with certain aspects of the invention it has been unexpectedly found that stream mixing homogenizes solubilizes the inclusion bodies of t endonuclease v and other proteins without the use of a denaturing agent and results in soluble and active protein in particular the cell suspension may be homogenized by methods that include forcing an impingement collision between two streams of dispersed cells each flowing at a velocity greater than  meterssecond so as to produce a single resultant stream that is flowing at about  metersecondafter homogenization the lysate may be clarified by many methods such as centrifugation or filtrationexample  and table  compare t endonuclease v in a waterbased supernatant prepared using the same cell paste and either a standard method of sonication or the method of stream mixing described herein the first data column in table  shows the results from the sonication processing and the second column shows the results from the stream mixing process the third column shows the ratio of the results from stream mixing divided by sonication the total amount of protein per milliliter recovered from the stream mixing approach was more than double the amount recovered from sonication analysis of the undissolved precipitate from the sonication process by both sdspage and western blot revealed that a substantial amount of t endonuclease v remained insoluble this is characteristic of undissolved inclusion bodies the total concentration of t endonuclease v in the soluble fraction of the stream mixed sample was more than seventimes greater than in the sonicated sample this value is greater than the increase in total protein concentration indicating that the stream mixing step selectively solubilized the t endonuclease v the result was a doubling of overall puritythe recovered protein was biologically active the unit activity which is a measurement of biological activity per unit volume was determined using the procedures of example  of the us pat no  patent this value increased fold indicating that the stream mixing process not only increased the yield of protein but that the protein was also active the specific activity which is the unit activity divided by the amount of protein in micrograms was twice as great reflecting the increase in purityalthough stream mixing is a preferred approach for the recovery of cpd glycosylase protein and activity the present invention does not require the use of this procedure for example techniques which involve the use of solubilizing agents which denature the cpd glycosylase can be used if desired see for example yarosh et al after stream mixing if used the cpd glycosylase may be recovered by various purification techniques now known or subsequently developed in the art including without limitation affinity chromatography size exclusion chromatography ionexchange chromatography and combinations of these or other methods standard and conventional methods of protein purification are covered in many text books including scopes  the goal of the purification is to reach a cpd glycosylase purity which is preferably  or greatera significant problem in commercial scale purification of t endonuclease v is the presence of contaminating hua proteins these are abundant proteins in e coli and have many characteristics similar to t endonuclease v so that they copurify using industrial separation methods the proteins may be separated using researchscale techniques but these methods result in greatly reduced yield of t endonuclease v this may not be a concern for a research program that requires small amounts of very pure protein but it is unsatisfactory for a commercial scale production scheme that requires large amounts of protein eg amounts suitable for regulatory approval similar purification problems can exist for other cpd glycosylases based on the endogenous proteins of the host cellexample  and table  show the results of a commercialtype purification scheme applied to e coli cultures expressing either the native or recombinant denv gene the purification steps were the same for the two cultures in particular the cell paste for each was sonicated and then purified following the methods of the us pat no  patent the first data column in table  reports the overall protein yield and the second column reports the yield of t endonuclease v determined by western blotting the third column reports the purity of the preparation which is the yield of t endonuclease v divided by the total protein yieldas can be seen from this data the recombinant gene expression system produced more protein than the native gene expression system specifically the yield of t endonuclease was over fold greater for the recombinant system resulting in a lysate which was  pure compared to not even  pure in the case of the native gene protein at each step of purification the purity of the recombinant gene protein preparation was substantially greater being nearly homogenous following gel filtrationthe final preparation of t endonuclease v from the native gene expression system contained approximately  of its protein as hua which was clearly visible in sdspage gels loaded with as little as  micrograms of protein data not shown the final preparation of t endonuclease v from the recombinant gene expression system on the other hand was virtually completely pure and no huα protein was visible in gels loaded with  micrograms of protein data not shown hplc analysis of these preparations confirmed that huα was detectible in native gene expressed protein but undetectable in recombinant gene expressed protein an explanation for this is that the increased yield of t endonuclease produced a much higher ratio of endonuclease to huα protein therefore when a few micrograms of total protein were analyzed the hua fraction was so greatly reduced as to be undetectablei topical preparationscpd glycosylases can be administered in various ways a preferred form of administration being topical since sun damage to dna of the skin is prevalent and the resulting cancers are a serious health concern in order to achieve delivery into the skin the proteins may be formulated in many forms which include delivery vehicles such as liposomes microsponges or nanoparticles and which may include penetration enhancers such as oleic acidliposomes may be dispersed in many types of formulations including hydrogel formulations many types of hydrogels are available and they may be used at between  and  however the important factor is not the concentration of the hydrogel but the viscosity of the resulting formulation for example using a salt buffer such as phosphate buffered saline a  formulation of the hydrogel hypan ss has a viscosity of only about  centipoises while a  formulation of the hydrogel carbomer  nf produces a lotion with a viscosity of over  centipoisesthe liposomes may be combined with other ingredients that benefit the skin such as sunscreens antioxidants moisturizers antiinflammatory or antinociceptic agents fragrances colors and other ingredients used in the art they may also be combined with excipients that increase the stability of the formulation or its ingredients and with preservatives that prevent microbial contaminationa surfactant in the lotion at sufficiently low concentration can improve the tactile feel of the lotion without disrupting the liposomes many types of surfactants may be used including many grades of polyethylene glycol peg also called carbowax concentrations are preferably in the range of  to  eg approximately  surfactants may be used with waterinsoluble ingredients such as oils and chemical sunscreens to produce emulsions the emulsions may be characterized as oilinwater waterinoil or waterinoilinwateran example of a suitable formulation for topical administration is discussed in example  this example includes procedures which result in a lotion that has the type of “feel” that people expect from a topical product that should be used often eg every day to prevent dna damage caused by sun exposurealthough patients with life threatening skin diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum may be willing to use less appealing formulations compliance for patients with less serious disease requires a more attractive formulation such as that of example  people who benefit from such a formulation include patients whose dna repair has been impaired by the use of immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine a tacrolimus picrolimus ascomycin fk and other calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin and other cyclophilin binding drugs other people who benefit from a formulation with a good “feel” are those with latent herpes labialis infections who are at risk for reactivation of the virus due to sun exposure still another group of people who benefit from such a formulation are those with autoimmune disease or photosensitive diseases that are exacerbated by dna damage from uv light exposure such as lupus erythematosus and polymorphic light eruptionwithout intending to limit it in any manner the present invention will be more fully described by the following examplesexample synthesis of recombinant t denv genea recombinant t denv gene was synthesized as singlestranded pieces using the codon selection rules and the

and validated by sequencing the plasmid from one of the master bank vials a working cell bank was prepared by expansion of one vial of the master cell bank and this bank was used to inoculate fermentation batches the stability of the plasmid in the e coli was verified by comparing colony counts on plates with and without kanamycin the similarity of the counts demonstrated that  of the

states of america in e coli strain lmg and has been assigned the accession number pta this deposit was made under the budapest treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for the purposes of patent procedure  on jun  the transformed cells were induced to express t endonuclease v with arabinose in several ways including at one extreme treatment of a high density culture with about  larabinose for a few hours at ° c and at the other extreme treatment of a low density culture with a concentration of about  larabinose for several hours at ° c the most practical method with the best yield was found to be addition of  larabinose to the inoculated culture at ° c ie a low density culture followed by growth to a high density stationary phase before harvesting the cellsexample enhanced recovery of cpd glycosylase activityinduction of expression of recombinant t endonuclease v using the plasmid of example  was found to result in accumulation of the expressed protein in the insoluble fraction of a sonicated lysate which is characteristic of inclusion bodiesspecifically from  h to  h postinduction the proportion of the soluble protein fraction that was t endonuclease v remained at about  of total protein while the fraction of insoluble protein that was t endonuclease v dramatically increased from  to over  overnight incubation of these cultures resulted in a yield of about  protein in the soluble fraction as t endonuclease v while in the insoluble fraction the proportion was over following fermentation the cells were collected by fixed

and after collision is about  metersecond although not wishing to be bound by any theory of operation it is believed that kinetic energy is transferred to the cells in connection with this change in velocity which disrupts the cells and the inclusion bodies contained within the cells the disruption of the inclusion bodies is believed to denature the protein so that it can subsequently refold into active proteinwhen a single pass was performed the product stream passed through both the apm and the ic the operating pressure in this case was between  psi at the start of processing and leveled off to  psi with further operation when two passes were performed the first pass was through the apm which broke up the suspension the suspension was then diluted with  volumes of pbs to prevent clogging and then a second pass was performed through the apm and ic in either case the microfluidizer® base and product outlet cooling coil were packed in ice during cell disruption in order to prevent the generation of degradation productsafter a single pass no intact cells were apparent by microscopic examination accordingly this approach is preferred since it involves fewer processing steps after the completion of the stream mixing procedure the debris in the solution was removed by centrifugation at  rpm for  minutes in a beckman model j centrifuge with a ja rotor followed by lysate clarification by filtration through  μm sartobran p filtersthe stream mixing approach of the present invention was compared to a method of the prior art which used only sonication to lyse the cells cell paste from the recombinant expression vector induced with larabinose was prepared at approximately  grams per liter at refrigerated temperatures and was processed by sonication for  hours using a misonix xl continuous flow sonicator farmingdale ny at an output setting of  the paste reservoir was cooled with ice packs and circulated with a cole palmer model  peristaltic pump model  pump head with ⅜″ id tubing at setting number  debris was removed by centrifugation at  rpm for  minutes using a beckman model ja centrifuge with a jla  rotorthe supernatants from the stream mixer single pass procedure and sonicator preparations were analyzed for a recovery of total protein b t endonuclease v protein by western blotting and c dna repair activity table  shows results for sonication average of five preparations and stream mixing average of  preparationsas can be seen in this table the stream mixing method is clearly superior in yield of total protein  and even more so in yield of t endonuclease v  total activity in the preparation unit activity is dramatically increased due to the solubilization and reactivation of the t endonuclease v from the inclusion bodies the protein purity is more than twice as great and the specific activity enzyme activity divided by total protein is also twice as great indicating that the protein contributing to the increased purity is also enzymatically activeexample comparison of yield and purity of t endonuclease v protein purified from e coli cultures expressing either the native or recombinant denv gene sequencee coli were induced to express either the native denv gene or the recombinant denv gene of example  under the same conditions in each case the t endonuclease v was purified by the same methods ie the methods of the us pat no  and us pat no  patents table  compares the yield and purity of the preparations at each step in the productionpurification processas can be easily observed in table  at each step in the process the t endonuclease v purity is greater in the preparation that began with the recombinant gene compared to expression from the native sequence in the end the native sequence method yielded protein with only  purity while the recombinant gene yielded protein with  purityexample topical application of cpd glycosylasesan example of a formulation that can be used to topically administer cpd glycosylases is shown in table  in this table the ingredients used in the formulation are followed by procedure steps which ensure that the lotion has a consistency and feel appropriate for daily topical administrationexample use of stream mixing to recover noncpd glycosylase proteinsthis example illustrates the use of stream mixing to recover proteins other than cpd glycosylases from inclusion bodiesin a first experiment photolyase from anacystis nidulans was recovered from inclusion bodies formed in e coli bacteria photolyase is a dna repair enzyme having a molecular weight of  kdin this experiment a cell paste of e coli bacteria containing this photolyase in inclusion bodies was resuspended with gentle stirring overnight in phosphate buffered saline the cell suspension was processed by stream mixing using a microfluidics model my pressure homogenizer with an hz interaction chamber at  to ° c the recovered homogenate was clarified by ultrafiltration and  μm filtration which eliminated cells cell debris and residual inclusion bodies the recovered solution was further purified by quaternary ammonium membrane ion exchange chromatographythe partially purified enzyme had a protein concentration of  mgml and a potency of  units per microgram where a unit is defined as the number of endonucleasesensitive sites per million bases removed per microgram of protein under standard assay conditions yarosh et al in a second experiment oxoguanine glycosylase ogg from arabidopsis thalania was recovered from inclusion bodies in e coli ogg is a dna repair enzyme of  kdin this experiment a cell paste of e coli bacteria containing ogg in inclusion bodies was resuspended with gentle stirring overnight in a hepes based buffer  mm hepes  mm nacl  mm edta ph  at a density of  gml the cell suspension was processed by stream mixing using a microfluidics model my pressure homogenizer with an hz interaction chamber at  to ° c the recovered homogenate was clarified by centrifugation and  μm filtration which eliminated cells cell debris and residual inclusion bodies the recovered solution had a protein concentration of  mgml with an enzyme activity of × units per microgram where a unit is defined as in the us pat no  patentin this example as well as in example  stream mixing was performed using a pressure homogenizer from microfluidics inc newton mass suitable equipment for performing stream mixing is available from various other manufacturers for example another device that causes stream mixing is the emulsiflexc made by avestin inc  don reid drive ottawa canada this device operates essentially like the microfluidics device in that it spits the main stream into two streams which then collide with each other a further device that causes stream mixing is the mini debee made by bee international inc  eastman street south easton mass which directs a first stream against a fixed surface which rebounds and collides with the oncoming stream to cause the stream mixing these or other devices now known or subsequently developed can be used in the practice of the stream mixing aspects of the inventionas the foregoing examples demonstrate in accordance with the invention it has been unexpectedly found that changing the nucleotide sequence of the denv gene greatly increases the percentage of cell protein found as t endonuclease v and without cell death for the first time cells have been prepared that consistently include much greater than  of cellular protein as t endonuclease v it has been further unexpectedly discovered that although a large fraction of the t endonuclease v in the cells so induced are in inclusion bodies the use of a stream mixer solubilizes the inclusion bodies and recovers active protein in this way the twostep process of a solubilizing inclusion bodies using a denaturing agent and b subsequently removing the denaturing agent to obtain active protein can be avoided the recombinant dna aspects of the invention can be used with cpd glycosylases other than t endonuclease v and the stream mixing aspects can be used with a variety of proteins other than cpd glycosylasesalthough specific embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be made without departing from the inventions spirit and scope the following
