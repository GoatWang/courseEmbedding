a given period and reinvestment of its dividends or income yield measures the income paid by a fund since a money market fund tries to maintain a  share price yield is an important measure of performance if fidelity had not reimbursed certain expenses the past five and  year total returns would have been lower cumulative total returns periods ended june   past  past  past  year years years

years or ten years for example if you invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the average all taxable money market fund which reflects the performance of  taxable money market funds with similar objectives tracked by ibcdonoghue over the past  months

the income paid by the fund over a given period yields for money market funds are usually for sevenday periods expressed as annual percentage rates a yield that assumes income earned is reinvested or compounded is called an effective yield the chart above shows the funds current sevenday yield at quarterly intervals over the past year you can compare these yields to the average all taxable money market fund and the average bank money market deposit account mmda figures for the average all taxable money market fund are from ibcdonoghue the mmda average is supplied by bank rate monitortrademark a money market funds total returns and yields will vary and reflect past results rather than predict future performance comparing performance there are some important differences between a bank money market deposit account mmda and a money market fund first the us government neither insures nor guarantees a money market fund in fact there is no assurance that a money market fund will maintain a  share price second a money market fund returns to its shareholders income earned by the funds investments after expenses this is in contrast to banks which set their mmda rates periodically based on current interest rates competitors rates and internal criteria checkmark the north carolina capital management trust  cash portfolio fund talk the managers overview an interview with burnell stehman portfolio manager of the north carolina capital management trust cash portfolio q burnie how did the cash portfolio perform a the funds sevenday yield on june   was  compared to  a year ago for the year ended june   the funds total return was  that compares favorably with the average total return of  during the same period for the average all taxable money market funds according to ibcdonoghue q what can you tell us about the interest rate environment a we havent seen such a dramatic shift in the middle of the funds fiscal year since the late s throughout the second half of  everything the federal reserve did was designed to slow down the pace of economic growth and prevent an outbreak of inflation as recently as the fourth quarter of  when growth surged ahead at an annual rate of more than  it looked as if the fed still had a lot of work to do but then very quickly we began to see signs of weakness throughout the economy the firstquarter  growth rate was slightly above the feds noninflationary trend rate of  but there was no denying that the economy had slowed down dramatically in fact by early summer some economists were speculating that the fed had overshot its goal of a soft landing for the economy and began to have concerns that an extended downturn could lead to a recession q what kind of strategic adjustments did you make during the period a as long as the economy was heating up and the fed was raising interest rates i positioned the fund very defensively my aim was to keep pace with current rates and maintain as much flexibility as i could by the end of december the funds average maturity was around  days later in the period as signs of economic weakness accumulated and prospects for an eventual fed rate cut improved i began buying longerterm securities and gradually extending the funds average maturity by the end of june i had the fund out around  days q given the current rate environment do you have plans to extend the funds average maturity further in the months ahead a i would characterize the funds average maturity at the end of the period as being toward the aggressive side of neutral if i thought we were headed for a recession i might want to extend the fund further but that seems unlikely among the historical prerequisites for a recession are high inflation tight credit conditions and an inverted yield curve with longerterm securities yielding less than shorterterm securities none of those conditions currently apply the upshot is while i may want to extend the fund slightly i probably wont go much beyond  days

trust term portfolio q bob how did the term portfolio perform a not as well as i would have liked although the fund had a decent first half of the year the overall results were disappointing thats because the fund was positioned too conservatively while the bond market was rallying during the last six months of its fiscal year for the  months ended june   the funds total return was  that was less than the  total return for the salomon brothers month treasury bill index going forward ill be measuring the funds performance more closely against this index which is a representation of the month treasury bill market my goal will continue to be to generate returns that are better than the month treasury bill market as a whole while attempting to dampen relative volatility q how has the interestrate environment changed since the period began a the difference is like night and day a year ago the federal reserve was still aggressively pursuing a policy designed to slow down the pace of economic growth and prevent an outbreak of inflation the rate on the oneyear treasury bill was rising steadily along with the feds primary tool for carrying out its monetary policy the federal funds rate which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans by the end of   the halfway point in the funds fiscal year  the oneyear treasury was yielding  there was still one more rate increase to come in february but since then as the economy has slowed down rates have fallen sharply several factors have fueled the rally including continued deterioration in the economy a stable us dollar which has encouraged foreign investors to become more active in the us market and lately aggressive buying on the part of market participants who had stayed on the sidelines during the early stages of the rally by the end of june the oneyear treasury was yielding  q how did your strategy change a the funds average maturity for much of the period was less than one year that was an advantage as long as interest rates were rising and bond prices were falling it quickly became a disadvantage once rates started moving the other way in february  and bond prices rose as rates have continued falling ive taken steps in recent months to extend the funds average maturity to closer to one year q whats the outlook for the rest of  a its clear that the pace of economic activity has slowed markedly during the first quarter of  the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of  compared to  during the fourth quarter of  by the end of june economists were predicting a secondquarter  growth rate of less than  and speculation centered on when the fed might cut rates as we all know by now the fed did cut the federal funds rate onequarter percentage point on july  shortly after the period ended while the fed may not be through cutting yet the economy has shown signs of unexpected strength lately housing has improved slightly and consumer confidence appears to be rising given the uncertain outlook id probably rather have the added flexibility that comes with an average maturity of slightly less than one year fund facts goal term portfolio seeks to obtain as high a level of current
