with numerous compounds in trials read more  ed arce hc wainwright  co  durect corp is a company that has an epigenetic regulator this was something that was done inhouse over a number of years even though this is quite early it has a lot of potential because unlike a lot of companies that will look at preclinical models�often a mouse model or a rat model of nash�and use that as a basis for moving forward into clinical studies durect has done a very thorough preclinical program with its compound durect looked at all the available preclinical models not only in rats and mice but also in several other species it has seen very consistent results in both nash overall as well as antifibrotic effects so were very eager to see what the impacts of this could be in the clinic the company

sales  this deal with a large pharma partner with strong economics not only eliminates investor uncertainty of whether sufficient financial resources exist to support the full development of dur but

company  durect corp showed solid progress as they came to impressive terms with sandoz for development and commercialization of posimir  we don�t believe drrx could have asked for a better partner as

baseline following dosing of dur in fck cck il and bilirubin these data support the ongoing development of dur for the treatment of nash and investigators speculated on the plausibility of a

multiple candidates we are especially optimistic about the companys epigenomic regulator program dur which holds great potential for multiple indications such as nash and acute kidney injury  our fair value for durect is  per share jim molloy laidlaw  company  it is the expectation that the sisyphean development of durect corps posimir may be drawing to a conclusion drrx anticipates completing

our view  the reduction of these biomarkers plus results from the companys animal and cell culture studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of dur jim molloy laidlaw  company  durect corp announced encouraging preliminary data last night in their phase b chronic nash study  first patient study treated with lowest dose of dur showed reduction liver function and injury biomarkers after

abusedeterrent properties of remoxy� and the proposed drug labeling and specified additional trials and data that are needed for approval we note that this crl contains a different set of requirements from the previous crl  management of pain therapeutics has indicated a continued commitment to developing remoxy� through regulatory approval and that a year may be needed to conduct the studies required  we continue to expect positive readouts from dur trials considering the drug�s multiple levels of mechanism of action len yaffe stocdoc partners  my positive opinion of drrx relates to its phase  drug dur which is being studied for nash and acute kidney injury this is a high riskhigh reward opportunity that if successful should be worth  per share in incremental value vs analyst estimates of   given the current market capitalization of  million and the significant upside i maintain that investment is warranted jim molloy laidlaw  company  durect corp enters what could be one of the most productive second halves of the year in the companys history the coming months could see an fda approval for the abuse resistant la oxycodone remoxy on or around the september th pdufa

multiple phase ii trials will be initiated in late  or early  conducted in australia  a request for a preind meeting has been granted by the fda the company anticipates that feedback from that meeting

remains the  pdufa date for remoxy an abusedeterrent longacting formulation of oxycontin drrx also updated the phase  endpoint for posimur postoperative bupivacaine injection changing the endpoint to pain relief at  hrs from  hrs previously which ought to make the comparison vs placebo easier  we continue to see that drrx has a deep pipeline with multiple nearterm catalysts that could drive

continue to expect positive outcome from this pivotal study ram selvaraju rodman  renshaw  durect corporation and pain therapeutics announced that the fda had determined that an advisory committee meeting for remoxy  is unnecessary and will not be held  this suggests that the efficacy and safety profile of remoxy has been well presented in the nda package from the fdas perspective and additional application material is unlikely to be requested  remoxy is likely to secure regulatory approval in september in the wake of this update and in anticipation of the products approval nearterm we reiterate our buy rating and  price target ram selvaraju rodman  renshaw  durect corps dur is being tested in a phase b trial in nash patients in australia  a second phase b study of dur

durect has made great progress during the first quarter of  ram selvaraju rodman  renshaw  we are initiating coverage of durect corp with a buy rating and a month price target of share in our view a significant component of the companys future upside potential could come from its epigenomic regulatory program centered on an endogenous small molecule designated dur  the oral formulation of dur is currently undergoing a phase b trial in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients with results potentially available by qe chen lin what is chen buying what is chen selling  i bought an initial position in a smallcap biotech today durect corp  the company has something that can be a major breakthrough for mankind  dur works like magic for liver disease and kidney injury etc  durects partner already

oxycontin which continues to be abused in its current form durects new formulation of oxycodone called remoxy oraduroxycodone has made it very difficult for abusers to extract the active ingredient to get a concentrated hit of the pills payload its poorly or not at all extracted in alcohol it turns into a gel you cant grind it you cant snort it  if remoxy is demonstrated to have superior abusedeterrent properties than oxycontin which emerging evidence suggests it does then its likely to capture more of the market  depending on sales volume durect stands to receive  to  of sales revenue as royalties from pain therapeutics read more  the life sciences report interview with jim molloy  durect corp is one of those names that has gotten caught in the derisking market decline and for valid reasons  people are looking at durects past and that is obscuring what could be a transformative early  the companys key asset remoxy oxycodone represents  or more than half of our share valuation for the company its an abusedeterrent opioid product  investors are discounting this product but perhaps too much at this point  its going back to the fda for a third time in q remoxy is partnered with pain therapeutics our understanding is that pain therapeutics will get remoxy filed in march followed by a sixmonth response time pain therapeutics plans to partner this product with a larger pharma it is not going to launch remoxy itself  the winds are blowing in remoxys favor this goaround  i think the increase in durects share price has been driven by word getting out that pain
