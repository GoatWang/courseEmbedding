semiconductor about indice semiconductor admin t expand the horizon of possibility indice semiconductor is changing the world one ic at a time   while others might talk about innovation indice lives and breathes it we take changing the world very seriously we don’t accept that things should stay the same just because that’s how they’ve been done for decades   key benefits of indice technology high power density – our ics enable our customers to pack a lot into significantly smaller mechanicals reducing not only size but also weight more efficient – reduced heat loss and higher performance means more powerful end products reduced costs – these efficiency gains mean lower production costs in our customers’ manufacturing process   about indice semiconductor indice was founded when we recognized a potential application for our power control algorithm within the then emerging energy efficient lighting space we began development of an mr led driver ic and later a offline led driver ic enhanced iterations of both remain in our product suite until this day we recognized that our breakthroughs in led lighting were able to be applied elsewhere and soon developed audio proof of concepts that have been proclaimed by audiophile equipment manufacturers as the best digital amplifiers they’d ever heard these successes were driven by our revolutionary continuous sigmatm encoding method a digital semiconductor architecture that replaces many high performance analog circuits for power control and conversion   continuous sigma it’s not evolution – it’s revolution continuous sigmatm has been described by industry leader mark telefus as the single most significant breakthrough in semiconductor power control and conversion in  years     while our competitors are limited by their use of traditional more complex delta sigma encoding methods which have barely changed since they were developed in the s our radical method has enabled us to develop the most efficient high performance and high power density ics available in the led lighting and audio markets   “continuous sigmatm is simple and conservative yet it is also radical  revolutionary because it can be applied to applications as wide as lighting control and high fidelity audio” – mark telefus power industry leader iwatt cto and cofounder   our technology is changing the world we’re not stopping with led lighting and audio amplifiers continuous sigmatm has so many applications including renewable energy inverters power supplies for data centres signal control electric motor control and so much more     our responsibility as a developer of leading energy efficient technology indice has a responsibility to uphold the finest standards throughout the product cycle some of the commitments we have made include we will nurture and grow our relationships with our customers partners and investors with clear and honest communication friendly and helpful service and the kind of expertise they would

advance electric vehicle technologyin the spirit of the open source movement tesla has removed patents to allow greater innovation from electric vehicle developers tesla motors ceo elon musk acknowledges that the real competitors of his company aret the few other ev models on the market currently but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the worlds factories every day like any other technology developer tesla created patents in order to avoid the theft of their ideas by competitors however musk believes that the opportunity to reduce emissions and move the world towards a more sustainable and efficient transport system is crucial pointing out that currently ev accounts for less than  of total vehicle sales while removing patents is a bold move and one that perhaps can be afforded only by the fact that tesla is currently secure in its position as market leader the decision will surely be inspiring for the global engineering community we believe that tesla other companies making electric cars and the world would all benefit from a common rapidlyevolving technology platform writes musk technology leadership is not defined by patents  but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the worlds most talented engineers clearly dedicated to an ev future rather than dominated by its own bottom line tesla recently announced that a competitive pricing strategy in europe and china rather than taking advantage of markets traditionally open to the cost of luxury vehicles ensuring affordability and encouraging innovation may well be a strategy that maintains tesla motorss position as global electric vehicle leader   read elon musks patent article hereby admin t june th categories electric vehicles technology newstags electric

package tiers to suit various budget performance and manufacturing requirements indice’s baseline g ic package indice is ideal for lighting manufacturers who wish to provide their customers with quality led lights featuring deep dimming and the broadest compatibility with dimmer infrastructure and halogen transformers available in the market the baseline ics benefit from active temperature management which limits the operating temperature of the chip and electronics extending the life of the luminaire power normalization keeps light levels consistent across all transformer types the second tier of g ic packages available indice offers the same features as tier one with the additional benefit of providing manufacturers the flexibility to control the active temperature management point it also includes active rectifier control and synchronous mosfet for boost stage which increase driver efficiency and compatibility the highest tier package indice offers all the above features plus asynchronous current regulation enabling unparalleled flickerfree dimming performance with active transformer detection capability all g ics are suitable for use with both magnetic and electronic transformers and are compatible with electronic transformers available globally the ics can be integrated into mr and ar retrofit lamps and are also suitable for low voltage outdoor lighting vac
