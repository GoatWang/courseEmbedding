well rounded commentary june   the geeky calvinist quality  value  meets expectations  luke is an new testament commentary written by john t carroll published by westminster john knox press this commentary is one of the most well written volumes in the new testament library commentary a series which is synonymous with thought provoking critical scholarship this volume continues this legacy while carroll is no stranger to biblical commentaries this is his first foray into this renowned commentary series luke begins with the typical study into the introductory matters of this book of the bible yet while introductions are common this introduction is atypical of most commentaries it is not that this work does dive into history and recent scholarship which carroll does a phenomenal job of rather it is the thoroughness that he takes with these introductory matters which makes this commentary atypical in a day where these matters are either glossed over to get to the exegesis of the text or are so cumbersome that they become useless carroll though has found a good balance in being thorough communicating depth and attention to recent scholarship without losing the forest in the trees in reference to the commentary section on the text of this gospel carroll takes great care in carefully showing the original context of passage while applying it directly to the modern day reader with regard of recommending luke to others i would recommend this commentary to scholarly students of scripture by this i mean i recommend this work to pastors scholars bible teachers bible college students and seminary students there is enough academic weight to this text to understand a particularly issue in the text while giving aid to pastors in preaching the text for a pastor who is more on the conservative side i would recommend this commentary in tandem with a commentary which examines the gospel of luke from said point of view this book was provided to me free of charge from westminster john knox publishing in exchange for an unbiased honest review luke a commentary the new testament library  by john t carroll publisher westminster john knox press page count  pages isbn  was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate jimmy reagan leesville sc age  gender male  stars out of  helpful march   jimmy reagan leesville sc age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  this commentary is a fairly recent entry in the wellknown new testament library ntl series before i received this book i had heard reports that it was one of the most practical volumes in the series for pastors now that ive had a chance to get into it i must agree its a quality midsize commentary for the gospel of luke after an extensive bibliography mr carroll gets into his introduction on lukes gospel though rather brief i felt it covered all the bases well in fact it might be the length that many pastors would prefer he begins by explaining lukes impressive qualities including he says christian historian gifted storyteller literary artist and theologian he sees luke is drawing the picture of jesus within the roman world as you will find in most such commentaries he outlines what has been believed about luke being the author of this gospel he dates lukes gospel later than i would he discusses genre and purpose followed by the suggested approach to reading lukes gospel he feels that luke applies his story to israels story he sees lukes gospel as the theocentric and says what drives the story as gods faithful commitment and relentless activity to accomplish the divine purpose for israel and through israel for all people finally after discussing textual issues of the gospel of luke he gets into the design of the narrative which covers issues of structure all in all its an introduction well done the commentary itself was well done he brought in appropriate background material defined the meaning of words and did lose track of the narrative flow of the gospel of luke every passage i checked had meaningful helpful commentary that you could appreciate in fact i compared some passages to what i had read in some of my favorite larger exegetical commentaries and mr carroll had something worthwhile to share in every passage this is a good resource to add to your shelves was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate john m kight michigan age  gender male  stars out of  an excellent commentary on luke december   john m kight michigan age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  john t carroll is the harriet robertson fitts memorial professor of new testament and director of the program for excellence in teaching and learning at union presbyterian seminary carrol received an mdiv and phd in new testament studies from princeton theological seminary and has since spent the bulk of his academic career primarily within the arena of lukan studies carroll authored andor edited a number of books including response to the end of history eschatology and situation in lukeacts  the death of jesus in early christianity  the return of jesus in early christianity  and the word in this world essays in new testament exegesis and theology  carroll has also published a long list of articles on lukeacts and various topics within new testament studies most recently carroll has contributed this present commentary a goodsized volume on the gospel of luke released as part of the critically acclaimed new testament library series luke a commentary carroll is a fairly wellknown scholarly voice within the world of new testament and lukan studies and this commentary visibly parades his expertise the commentary begins with a bibliography of uptodate commentaries monographs books and essays related to the gospel of luke if you enjoy these sections peruse them often and are well acquainted with lukeacts material this section will be reviewable and uptodate but far from comprehensive if none of the above describes your interest then you can rest assured that carroll has at least provided a solid and current bibliography of the third gospel to catapult your studies subsequently carroll provides the reader with a useful introduction carroll briefly surveys the traditional introductory categories ie authorship date purpose etc and addresses how to approach the reading of the third gospel and previews the central theological and ethical concerns and commitments therein the reader will find the introductory section to be a goldmine of helpful information for interacting with carroll in the commentary ahead it is an essential and recommended first stop the commentary itself is wrought with exegetical and theological insight carroll is excellent when it understanding the literary themes and intertextuality within the gospel of luke each section in the commentary is based on the authors original translation of the greek text and littered with textual notes carroll follows closely with the textual basis of the na and notes clearly when he favors alternative readings interestingly in a number of sections in the commentary carroll favors the shorter readings attested by the western text especially codex bezae cantabrigiensis d this is seen in his commentary and translation of several verses within luke  and  for example carroll does not find luke  original but provides a lengthy textual note detailing his decision p  because of the flexible text choice within the commentary many readers will be reluctant to engage carrolls work but this would be an unwarranted endeavor if anything this should provide added value to your library still the textual decisions may not be the only hindrance for the conservative reader carroll affirms luke as the author but neglects to affirm traditional lukan authorship in other words carroll names luke as the author but is unwilling to tell affirm that the luke writing the gospel is the individual traditionally understood to be the author p  moreover carroll is comfortable dating the third gospel well into the early second century  ce this assertion is largely based on his assumption that luke consulted the gospel of mark a fair assumption and that mark is dated around  ce therefore luke would have had to consult mark sometime after  ce the problem most will recognize is that there is no real difficulty dating mark in the mids in other words luke could have still consulted mark and completed his gospel account by the early s many conservative scholars have argued this point well and in much more depth but similar to the textual issue in the prior paragraph to overlook interaction with carroll because of these disagreements would be nave and unwarranted luke a commentary is an uptodate examination of one of the most significant accounts of the person and work of jesus christ in all of scripture john t carroll has provided a wellresearched presentation of the current conversation among new testament scholars and added additional ground with his sensitivity to literary themes and intertextuality carrolls translation and textual notes are indispensable and his selective favoritism of codex bezae is interesting and helpful for the trained reader if you are looking for a strong commentary on the gospel of luke from a critical perspective then john t carroll has provided you with a commentary that cannot be overlooked it will be off my bookshelf often i received a review copy of these books in exchange for and honest review i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have expressed are my own i am disclosing this in accordance with the federal trade commissions  cfr part  guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in
