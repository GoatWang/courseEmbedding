broad list of carefully selected reasonably priced securities rather than in securities whose prices reflect a premium resulting from their current market popularity the fund invests the major portion of its assets in equity securities primarily of us issuers for purposes of the funds investment policies equity securities include common stocks convertible debt and other equity instruments such as exchangetraded funds etfs that invest primarily in equity securities depositary receipts warrants rights equity interests in real estate investment trusts reits and preferred stocks pioneer investment management inc the funds investment adviser uses a value approach to select the funds investments using this investment style pioneer seeks securities selling at reasonable prices or at substantial discounts to their underlying values and then holds these securities until the market values reflect their intrinsic values pioneer evaluates a securitys potential value including the attractiveness of its market valuation based on the companys assets and prospects for earnings and revenue growth in making that assessment pioneer employs due diligence and fundamental research an evaluation of the issuer based on its financial statements and operations employing a bottomup analytic style pioneer also considers a securitys potential to provide a reasonable amount of income pioneer relies on the knowledge experience and judgment of its staff and the staff of its affiliates who have access to a wide variety of research pioneer focuses on the quality and price of individual issuers not on economic sector or markettiming strategies factors pioneer looks for in selecting investments include o above average potential for earnings and revenue growth o favorable expected returns relative to perceived risks o management with demonstrated ability and commitment to the company o low market valuations relative to earnings forecast book value cash flow and sales o turnaround potential for companies that have been through difficult periods o good prospects for dividend growth the fund primarily invests in securities of us issuers the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in securities of nonus issuers the fund will not invest more than  of its total assets in securities of emerging markets issuers principal risks of investing in the fund o you could lose money on your investment in the fund o the values of securities held by the fund may fall due to general market conditions such as real or perceived adverse economic political or regulatory  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th basic information about the fund conditions inflation changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment adverse market conditions may be prolonged and may not have the same impact on all types of securities the values of securities may fall due to factors affecting a particular issuer or sector or the securities market as a whole o the stock market goes down or performs poorly relative to other investments this risk may be greater in the short term o value stocks fall out of favor with investors o the funds investments remain undervalued or do not have the potential value originally expected o stocks selected for income or securities selected for capital appreciation do not perform as expected risks of nonus investments investing in nonus issuers may involve unique risks compared to investing in the securities of us issuers these risks are more pronounced for issuers in emerging markets or to the extent that the fund invests significantly in one region or country these risks may include o less information about nonus issuers or markets may be available due to less rigorous disclosure or accounting standards or regulatory practices o many nonus markets are smaller less liquid and more volatile in a changing market pioneer may not be able to sell the funds portfolio securities at times in amounts and at prices it considers reasonable o adverse effect of currency exchange rates or controls on the value of the funds investments o the economies of nonus countries may grow at slower rates than expected or may experience a downturn or recession o economic political and social developments may adversely affect the securities markets o withholding and other nonus taxes may decrease the funds return market segment risks to the extent the fund emphasizes from time to time investments in a market segment the fund will be subject to a greater degree to the risks particular to the industries in that segment and may experience greater market fluctuation than a fund without the same focus for example industries in the financial segment such as banks insurance companies brokerdealers and real estate investment trusts reits may be sensitive to changes in interest rates and general economic activity and are generally subject to extensive government regulation industries in the technology segment such as information technology communications equipment computer hardware and software and office and scientific equipment are subject to risks of rapidly evolving technology short product lives rates

pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th additional information about investment strategies and risks the following sections provide additional information about the funds investment strategies and risks to learn more about these investments and risks you should obtain and read the statement of additional information sai debt securities the fund may invest in debt securities of corporate and government issuers generally the fund acquires debt securities that are investment grade but the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in below investment grade debt securities issued by both us and nonus corporate and government issuers including convertible debt securities the fund invests in debt securities when pioneer believes they are consistent with the funds investment objective of reasonable income and capital growth to diversify the funds portfolio or for greater liquidity debt securities are subject to the risk of an issuers inability to meet principal or interest payments on its obligations factors that could contribute to a decline in the market value of debt securities in the funds portfolio include rising interest rates or a reduction in the perceived creditworthiness of the issuer of the securities a debt security is investment grade if it is rated in one of the top four categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or determined to be of equivalent credit quality by pioneer debt securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as junk bonds and are considered speculative below investment grade debt securities involve greater risk of loss are subject to greater price volatility and are less liquid especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change than higher quality debt securities investments in reits the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in reits reits are companies that invest primarily in real estate or real estate related loans investing in reits involves unique risks they are significantly affected by the market for real estate and are dependent upon management skills and cash flow in addition to its own expenses the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and other expenses paid by reits in which it invests derivatives the fund may but is not required to use futures and options on securities indices and currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts and other derivatives a derivative is a security or instrument whose value is determined by reference to the value or the change in value of one or more securities currencies indices or other financial instruments although there is no specific limitation on investing in derivatives the fund does not use derivatives as a primary investment technique  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th basic information about the fund and generally limits their use to hedging however the fund may use derivatives for a variety of purposes including o as a hedge against adverse changes in the market prices of securities interest rates or currency exchange rates o as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities o to increase the funds return as a nonhedging strategy that may be considered speculative derivatives may be subject to market risk interest rate risk and credit risk the funds use of certain derivatives may in some cases involve forms of financial leverage which involves risk and may increase the volatility of the funds net asset value even a small investment in derivatives can have a significant impact on the funds exposure to the market prices of securities interest rates or currency exchange rates therefore using derivatives can disproportionately increase losses and reduce opportunities for gain if changes in a derivatives value do not correspond to changes in the value of the funds other investments or do not correlate well with the underlying asset rate or index the fund may not fully benefit from or could lose money on the derivative position in addition some derivatives involve risk of loss if the issuer of the derivative defaults on its obligation certain derivatives may be less liquid which may reduce the returns of the fund if it cannot sell or terminate the derivative at an advantageous time or price some derivatives may involve the risk of improper valuation the fund will only invest in derivatives to the extent pioneer believes these investments are consistent with the funds investment objective but derivatives may not perform as intended suitable derivatives may not be available in all circumstances or at reasonable prices and may not be used by the fund for a variety of reasons cash management and temporary investments normally the fund invests substantially all of its assets to meet its investment objective the fund may invest the remainder of its assets in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year or cash equivalents or may hold cash for temporary defensive purposes including during periods of unusual cash flows the fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these securities or may hold cash during such periods the fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective the fund may adopt a defensive strategy when pioneer believes securities in which the fund normally invests have extraordinary risks due to political or economic factors and in other extraordinary circumstances  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th securities lending the fund may lend securities in its portfolio to certain brokerdealers or other institutional investors under agreements which require that the loans be secured continuously by collateral typically cash which the fund will invest during the term of the loan the fund will continue to have market risk and other risks associated with owning the securities on loan as well as the risks associated with the investment of the cash collateral received in connection with the loan securities lending also is subject to other risks including the risk that the borrower fails to return a loaned security andor there is a shortfall on the collateral posted by the borrower and the risk that the fund is unable to recall a security in time to exercise valuable rights or sell the security shortterm trading the fund usually does not trade for shortterm profits the fund will sell an investment however even if it has only been held for a short time if it no longer meets the funds investment criteria if the fund does a lot of trading it may incur additional operating expenses which would reduce performance and could cause shareowners to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital gains see financial highlights for actual annual turnover rates disclosure of portfolio holdings the funds policies and procedures with respect to disclosure of the funds portfolio securities are described in the statement of additional information reverse repurchase agreements and borrowing the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements pursuant to which the fund transfers securities to a counterparty in return for cash and the fund agrees to repurchase the securities at a later date and for a higher price reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings by the fund are a form of leverage and may make the value of an investment in the fund more volatile and increase the risks of investing in the fund this is because leverage generally magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the funds underlying asset or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have the fund also may borrow money from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes entering into reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowing transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th management pioneer the funds investment adviser selects the funds investments and oversees the funds operations pioneer is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of unicredit spa one of the largest banking groups in italy pioneer is part of the global asset management group providing investment management and financial services to mutual funds institutional and other clients as of december   assets under management were approximately  billion worldwide including over  billion in assets under management by pioneer and its affiliates investment adviser pioneers main office is at  state street boston massachusetts  the firms us mutual fund investment history includes creating in  one of the first mutual funds pioneer has received an order from the securities and exchange commission that permits pioneer subject to the approval of the funds board of trustees to hire and terminate a subadviser or to materially modify an existing subadvisory contract for the fund without shareholder approval pioneer retains the ultimate responsibility to oversee and recommend the hiring termination and replacement of any subadviser to the extent that the securities and exchange commission adopts a rule that would supersede the order or would provide greater flexibility than the order pioneer and the fund intend to rely on such rule to permit pioneer subject to the approval of the funds board of trustees and any other applicable conditions of the rule to hire and terminate a subadviser or to materially modify an existing subadvisory contract for the fund without shareholder approval portfolio management daytoday management of the funds portfolio is the responsibility of rod wright lead portfolio manager mr wright is supported by

and the portfolio managers ownership of shares of the fund  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th management fee the fund pays pioneer a fee for managing the fund and to cover the cost of providing certain services to the fund pioneers fee varies based on o the funds assets pioneer earns an annual basic fee equal to  of the funds average daily net assets up to  billion  on the next  billion and  on the excess over  billion o the funds performance the investment performance of the fund is compared to the russell  value index the basic fee can increase or decrease by a maximum of  depending on the performance of the funds class a shares relative to the index the performance comparison is made for a rolling month period pioneers fee increases or decreases depending upon whether the funds performance is up and down more or less than that of the index during the rolling month performance period each percentage point of difference between the performance of class a shares and the index to a maximum of  percentage points is multiplied by a performance rate adjustment of  as a result the maximum annualized rate adjustment is  for the rolling month performance period in addition pioneer contractually limits any positive adjustment of the funds management fee to  of the funds average daily net assets on an annual basis ie to a maximum annual fee of  after the performance adjustment this performance comparison is made at the end of each month an appropriate percentage of this rate based on the number of days in the current month is then applied to the funds average net assets for the entire performance period giving a dollar amount that will be added to or subtracted from the basic fee because the adjustment to the basic fee is based on the comparative performance of the fund and the performance record of the index the controlling factor is not whether fund performance is up or down but whether it is up or down more or less than the performance record of the index regardless of general market performance as a result pioneer could earn the maximum possible fee even if the funds net asset value declines moreover the comparative investment performance of the fund is based solely on the relevant performance period without regard to the cumulative performance over a longer or shorter period of time for the fiscal year ended september   the fund paid management fees equivalent to  of the funds average daily net assets a discussion regarding the basis for the board of trustees approval of the management contract is available in the

transfer agent are affiliates of pioneer  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th buying exchanging and selling shares net asset value the funds net asset value is the value of its securities plus any other assets minus its accrued operating expenses and other liabilities the fund calculates a net asset value for each class of shares every day the new york stock exchange is open when regular trading closes normally  pm eastern time the fund generally values its securities using closing market prices or readily available market quotations when closing market prices or market quotations are not available or are considered by pioneer to be unreliable the fund uses fair value methods to value its securities pursuant to procedures adopted by the board of trustees valuing securities using fair value methods may cause the net asset value of the funds shares to differ from the net asset value that would be calculated only using market prices for market prices and quotations as well as for some fair value methods the fund relies upon securities prices provided by pricing services the fund uses fair value pricing methods for a security including a nonus security when pioneer determines that the closing market price on the primary exchange where the security is traded no longer accurately reflects the value of the security at the time the fund calculates its net asset value this may occur for a variety of reasons that affect either the relevant securities markets generally or the specific issuer for example with respect to nonus securities held by the fund developments relating to specific events in the securities markets or the specific issuer may occur between the time the primary market closes and the time the fund determines its net asset value international securities markets may be open on days when the us markets are closed for this reason the values of any international securities owned by the fund could change on a day you cannot buy or sell shares of the fund certain types of securities including those discussed in this paragraph are priced using fair value pricing methods rather than market prices the fund uses a pricing matrix to determine the value of fixed income securities that may not trade daily a pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the basis of current market prices for other debt securities and historical trading patterns in the market for fixed income securities the fund values cash equivalent securities with remaining maturities of  days or less at amortized cost to the extent that the fund invests in the shares of other registered openend investment companies that are not traded on an exchange mutual funds such shares are valued at their published net asset values per share as reported by the funds the prospectuses of these funds explain the circumstances under which the funds will use fair value pricing methods to value their securities and the effects of using the fair value methodology you buy or sell shares at the share price when you buy class a shares you pay an initial sales charge unless you qualify for a waiver or reduced sales charge

sales charge depending on how long you have owned your shares  share price the net asset value per share calculated on the day of your transaction adjusted for any applicable sales charge   contingent deferred sales charge a sales charge that may be deducted from your sale proceeds  choosing a class of shares the fund offers three classes of shares through this prospectus each class has different sales charges and expenses allowing you to choose the class that best meets your needs factors you should consider include o how long you expect to own the shares o the expenses paid by each class o whether you qualify for any reduction or waiver of sales charges your investment professional can help you determine which class meets your goals your investment firm may receive different compensation depending upon which class you choose if you are not a us citizen and are purchasing shares outside the us you may pay different sales charges under local laws and business practices distribution plan the fund has adopted a distribution plan for each class of shares offered through this prospectus in accordance with rule b under the investment company act of  under the plan the fund pays distribution and service fees to the distributor because these fees are an ongoing expense of the fund over time they increase the cost of your investment and your shares may cost more than shares that are subject to other types of sales charges additional payments to financial intermediaries there are two principal ways you compensate the financial intermediary through which you buy shares of the fund  directly by the payment of sales commissions if any and indirectly as a result of the fund paying rule b fees the fund also may pay intermediaries for administrative services and transaction processing pioneer and its affiliates may make additional payments to your financial intermediary these payments by pioneer may provide your financial intermediary with an incentive to favor the pioneer funds over other mutual funds or assist the distributor in its efforts to promote the sale of the funds shares financial  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th intermediaries include brokerdealers banks including bank trust departments registered investment advisers financial planners retirement plan administrators and other types of intermediaries pioneer makes these additional payments sometimes referred to as revenue sharing to financial intermediaries out of its own assets revenue sharing is not an expense of the pioneer funds pioneer may base these payments on a variety of criteria including the amount of sales or assets of the pioneer funds attributable to the financial intermediary or as a per transaction fee not all financial intermediaries receive additional compensation and the amount of compensation paid varies for each financial intermediary in certain cases these payments may be significant pioneer determines which firms to support and the

for a variety of reasons such as if o you sell shares within a short period of time after the shares were purchased o you make two or more purchases and redemptions within a short period of time o you enter into a series of transactions that indicate a timing pattern or strategy or o we reasonably believe that you have engaged in such practices in connection with other mutual funds the funds board of trustees has adopted policies and procedures with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares by fund investors pursuant to these policies and procedures we monitor selected trades on a daily basis in an effort to detect excessive shortterm trading if we determine that an investor or a client of a broker or other intermediary has engaged in excessive shortterm trading that we believe may be harmful to the fund we will ask the investor broker or other intermediary to cease such activity and we will refuse to process purchase orders including purchases by exchange of such investor broker other intermediary or accounts that we believe are under their control in determining whether to take such actions we seek to act in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of the funds shareholders while we use our reasonable efforts to detect excessive trading activity there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that market timers will not employ tactics designed to evade detection if we are not successful your return from an investment in the fund may be adversely affected frequently fund shares are held through omnibus accounts maintained by financial intermediaries such as brokers and retirement plan administrators where the holdings of multiple shareholders such as all the clients of a particular broker or other intermediary are aggregated our ability to monitor trading practices by investors purchasing shares through omnibus accounts may be limited and dependent upon the cooperation of the broker or other intermediary in taking steps to limit this type of activity the fund may reject a purchase or exchange order before its acceptance or the issuance of shares the fund may also restrict additional purchases or exchanges  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in an account each of these steps may be taken for any transaction for any reason without prior notice including transactions that the fund believes are requested on behalf of market timers the fund reserves the right to reject any purchase or exchange request by any investor or financial institution if the fund believes that any combination of trading activity in the account or related accounts is potentially disruptive to the fund a prospective investor whose purchase or exchange order is rejected will not achieve the investment results whether gain or loss that would have been realized if the order were accepted and an investment made in the fund a fund and its shareholders do not incur any gain or loss as a result of a rejected order the fund may impose further restrictions on trading activities by market timers in the future to limit the negative effects of excessive trading on the fund the fund has adopted the following restriction on investor transactions if an investor redeems  or more including redemptions that are a part of an exchange transaction from the fund that investor shall be prevented or blocked from purchasing shares of the fund including purchases that are a part of an exchange transaction for  calendar days after the redemption this policy does not apply to systematic
