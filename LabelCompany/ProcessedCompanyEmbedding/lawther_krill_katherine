business before we get started however let me just say that the board and i are very pleased with the outcome of our strategic review process and we are confident that the agreement with ascena is in the best interests of ann incs stockholders the combination of cash and stock provides stockholders both immediate and certain value and the opportunity to participate in the upside of the combined company in addition this is the right next step for our company and our associates clients and business partners we look forward to completing the transaction and this next chapter for ann inc turning now to our results overall i am pleased that we delivered bottomline results for the quarter that exceeded our expectations we were able to achieve these quarterly results despite softer than anticipated gross margin through ongoing effective management of expenses to recap the results total net sales for the quarter increased  to  million up from  million in the first quarter last year comparable sales declined  reflecting a comp decline of  for the ann taylor brand and a decline of  for the loft brand the gross margin rate for the quarter was  primarily reflecting a continued high level of promotional activity sga expenses for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the first quarter of last year our sga rate of  reflected a basispoint improvement compared with the first quarter of  this was our most efficient first quarter in seven years and demonstrated our ongoing commitment to efficiently manage our cost structure the continued benefit of the restructuring actions we took in first quarter  as well as the initial benefits associated with our recently announced sga optimization program on a gaap basis diluted earnings per share for the quarter was  compared with  per diluted share in the first quarter of  on an operating basis excluding the impact of an  restructuring charge related to our previously announced supply chain initiative and sga optimization program adjusted first quarter  eps was  compared with our adjusted first quarter  operating eps of  our results this quarter reflected a weak february but stronger performance in the combined march april period as clients responded favorably to our spring assortment that coincided with the onset of warmer weather as i noted on our last call february was challenging given the severe winter weather in many of our markets including the northeast and midatlantic where our business is heavily concentrated our performance strengthened in march and we delivered positive comps for the combined march april period at both ann taylor and loft performance during the quarter was also affected at loft by some late product deliveries related to the west coast port situation which impacted our ability to offer the full store set on time overall we continue to focus on delivering meaningful growth on the top and bottom lines as the year progresses we are committed to driving increased productivity and profitability by delivering compelling product that differentiates our brand in the marketplace and enables us to meet our clients wardrobing needs by enhancing the brand experience for our clients to a seamless omnichannel platform incorporating multiple touchpoints and making further improvements to our supply chain and operating structure with an emphasis on increasing our responsiveness and flexibility while lowering cost and improving efficiency the actions we have taken give us a strong foundation on which to build and im excited about the opportunities ahead for ann inc to grow the business and increase profitability lets now turn to the brands first ann taylor comparable sales increased  at ann taylor but were offset by a decline of  at factory in terms of the full price business we were particularly pleased with ann taylors performance in the combined march april period with comps increasing  over last year in addition based on the strength of the offering and our clean inventory position we were able to scale back overall store promotions and utilize more targeted category offers during the quarter overall the assortment was well received with dresses pants outerwear jackets sweaters and woven tops among the standouts she responded to our feminine styling and versatility especially in tops we offered more color and print choices for spring and this was a home run shades of blush corals blues and yellow performed especially well in the first quarter along with feminine floral prints from a marketing perspective we are very pleased with the results and direction of ann taylors spring campaigns which have continued to elevate the brand while engaging clients and potential clients through more targeted and cost effective channels our digital and social media campaigns have been particularly successful and we continue to refine and involve a mix of platforms and content that we are using to deliver the greatest return on our investment our focus will remain on driving traffic broadening the universe of ann taylor clients and deepening our relationship with existing clients to serve more of their wardrobing needs turning now to factory clearly the top line results for the first quarter were disappointing the majority of the shortfall reflected weakness in the knit and woven tops categories nevertheless the business continued to be a significant contributor to the bottom line from a product perspective we have identified opportunities especially in tops to drive better sellthrough overall we know we need to have a better balance of classic styling and brandappropriate fashion throughout the offering and we recognize there is work to do we have already begun to implement improvements and have begun to see a more favorable trend quartertodate versus first quarter looking ahead for ann taylor we are making progress on the initiatives we have underway which are designed to broaden the appeal of the brand reach new clients and drive market share growth these include continuing to evolve our product offering to provide more diversity and versatility in our style offering to meet multiple wear occasions while also building on our strong legacy of modern separates driving stronger performance in tops by offering a more balanced assortment across silhouette

product pipeline in order to be more fashion right fourth assuring that our fits are always feminine and flattering consistent with the brands heritage and at factory making the necessary changes in the assortment to drive higher sales and full price sellthrough overall we feel that we are better positioned as we head into summer and we look forward to building momentum at the ann taylor brand as we progress through the year turning now to loft comparable sales were down  at loft and were virtually flat at loft outlet loft had a challenging february but performance improved with the warmer weather and loft delivered a positive comp for the combined march april period pants shorts skirts woven tops knit tops boutiques and jewelry all generated positive comps for the quarter pants were especially strong driven by cropped styles and the successful early launch of our shorts offering sweaters and denim were softer than anticipated however it was our second consecutive quarter of comp growth in knit tops reflecting the work weve done in this category to rebalance the assortment infuse more fashion newness and add greater diversity and style in silhouette to drive strong sellthroughs and recapture volume key items were especially strong reflecting the initial success of our new testing strategy launched last fall we look forward to building on this progress over the balance of  and to maximize sales and margin performance in the entire tops category in addition color was strong across categories highlighted by shades of blue citron pink and mint white was also a standout across categories especially like denim and we benefited from having a higher print and novelty component with floral prints eyelet embroidery and lace details all performing very well from a marketing perspective loft strategies continued to focus on growing brand awareness driving traffic and fostering retention as you know the brand is increasingly relying on digital and social media vehicle which have been effective in cultivating greater client engagement in reaching new customers moving forward loft is building on this success by introducing more personalization across touchpoints and more targeted offers and messaging to drive engagement traffic and conversion turning now to loft outlet total sales for the first quarter rose  which was driven by yearoveryear store growth the performance also reflected significant improvements in aur and dpt the gross margin rate for loft outlet was particularly healthy for the quarter reflecting strong product sell through and our disciplined inventory management looking ahead for loft the team continues to focus on the priorities we have identified to drive the brand forward these include first increasing the penetration in our tops business by offering greater diversity in fabrications and necklines while offering her the fashion musthaves of the season this includes further expansion of our test and chase strategy which has resulted in a higher sell through and stronger product acceptance specifically in knit and woven tops second continuing to evolve and build our pants business by offering her flattering fits and modern styling third emphasizing versatility across every category which is the number one expectation of the loft client she comes to us for product that meets her multiple end uses from work to play fourth remaining focused on wardrobing which is clearly part of loft dna and finally always maintaining a healthy balance of color print and pattern which we know she expects from us overall we are focused on generating higher sales and profitability for the loft brand by gaining market share in key categories broadening the universe of loft clients and expanding our relationship with existing clients to capture more of the spend moving on to our corporate strategies on our call in march i addressed our strategic growth initiatives for  which are focused on putting our company and our brands in the strongest position to compete and grow over the longterm more than ever in todays retail environment this means having compelling differentiated product that provides our client with great choices for meeting her wardrobe needs delivering a seamless and engaging brand experience that maximizes ease and convenience and having a highlyefficient and flexible operating structure that allows us to operate as costeffectively as possible while optimizing speed and responsiveness let me briefly reiterate our key initiatives for the year first our supply chain initiative launched last november this initiative is focused on improving our production speed and flexibility increasing product sellthrough and reducing cost of goods sold in order to enhance topline sales and corporate profitability we have now identified a series of opportunities and are moving forward to develop and execute our plans some of the areas we focused on including expanding our use of test and chase strategies and working with vendors in new ways to compress the production timeline and buy product closer to season as we announced in march we anticipate generating at least  million of annualized incremental gross margin dollars by  second our new sga optimization program which was just announced in march under this program which is additive to the restructuring work we did in  we are currently targeting ongoing annualized savings of an additional  million by  during the first quarter we identified new opportunities to further increase efficiency and lower costs in our store staffing model primarily reducing costs in the back room without impacting sales or service this helped to contribute to the sga savings we experienced in the quarter we will continue to look broadly across our operations to identify additional opportunities to further increase our efficiency together our supply chain and sga initiatives are expected to significantly enhance the companys profitability third omnichannel we are very pleased with our progress in enhancing and elevating the client shopping experience across all channels in fact in early may we completed the rollout of omnichannel phase  ahead of schedule all ann taylor and loft stores now have endless aisle capabilities which give our clients seamless access to online inventory from the store environment the early results of this initiative are positive in addition we are continuing to generate an outstanding response to our enhanced mobile capability at both brands which has resulted in the higher sales and conversion finally our client are responding very positively to update and enhancements weve made on our website adding new features improved navigation and more modern aesthetics and fourth lou  grey were on track as we continue testing and refining our newest concept and we remain excited about its longterm potential during the quarter we opened our first new store in chicago which has generated a very strong response in total we now have six freestanding stores and are planning to open a handful of new locations in  in addition we are on track to launch our standalone lou  grey ecommerce site later this summer or early fall we know that we have an exciting opportunity to get the word out about lou  greys offering of casual effortless style with virtually no marketing todate our freestanding stores are attracting a majority of clients who are completely new to ann inc we look forward to building greater brand awareness and introducing lou  grey to a broader universe of women overall we are making good progress let me now turn it over to mike michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thanks kay and good morning everyone today ill start with a summary of results for the first quarter of  and then ill provide you some perspective on our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal  beginning with net sales net sales for the first quarter were  million an increase of  versus the  million of net sales reported in the first quarter of  by brand net sales across all channels of the ann taylor brand were  million down  from the  million reported last year primarily reflecting soft comps at ann taylor factory and the impact of the closure of  ann taylor stores since the first quarter of  partially offset by positive comps at ann taylor at the loft brand net sales were  million up  versus  million reported last year moving on to comps total company comparable sales for the quarter decreased  at the ann taylor brand total brand comps declined  reflecting an increase of  at ann taylor and a  decrease at ann taylor factory at the loft brand total brand comps for the first quarter declined  reflecting decreases of  at loft and  at loft outlet turning to gross margin we reported a first quarter gross margin rate of  versus last years rate of  primarily reflecting lower merchandise margin which was negatively impacted by severe weather early in the quarter soft traffic and the highly competitive retail environment as well as soft product performance at ann taylor factory and in select categories at loft together these factors caused us to be more promotional than planned in order to clear through inventory turning now to sga sga expenses in the first quarter were  million compared with  million reported in the first quarter of  as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses were  a basispoint improvement when compared with  in the first quarter of  this primarily reflected a reduction in overall store operating expenses due in part to our  sga optimization program as well as savings resulting from our first quarter  strategic realignment partially offset by an increase in performancebased compensation moving down the pl during the first quarter of  we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of  million in connection with our previously disclosed supply chain initiative and sga optimization program this compares with a pretax restructuring charge of  million recorded in the first quarter of  operating income on a gaap basis was approximately  million in the first quarter of  compared with  million in the first quarter of  excluding the  million restructuring charge operating income for the quarter would have been  million a  increase compared with adjusted operating income of  million in the first quarter of  on a gaap basis net income for the first quarter of  was  million or  per diluted share versus net income of  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  excluding the impact of the aforementioned restructuring charges for both periods adjusted net income for the first quarter of  was  million compared with adjusted net income of  million for the first quarter of  on the same basis adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of  would have been  representing a  increase compared to adjusted eps of  in the first quarter of  weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter decreased  to  million shares versus  million shares in  our effective tax rate for the quarter was  versus  in the first quarter of  depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled approximately  million compared with  million reported in the first quarter of  and finally capital expenditures in the first quarter totaled  million compared with  million in the first quarter of  moving on now to the details of our quarterend inventory we ended the first quarter of  with total inventory per square foot for the company up  compared with last year however when adjusting for timing shifts total inventory per square foot was down approximately  by channel inventory per square foot was down  at ann taylor reflecting an overall decrease in unit inventory per square foot at loft inventory was up  primarily reflecting a shift in the timing of receipts versus last year without which inventory per square foot would have been flat and inventory per square foot at the factoryoutlet channel was up  at the end of the first quarter and finally we have entered the second quarter with approximately  of our inventory representing fresh summer product turning now to store openings and closures during the first quarter of  we opened a total of eight new stores comprised of two ann taylor factory stores four loft stores one loft outlet store and one lou  grey store we also closed three ann taylor stores and one loft store the total store count at the end of the first quarter was  stores comprised of  ann taylor stores  ann taylor factory stores  loft stores  loft outlet stores and  lou  grey stores our store square footage at the end of the first quarter totaled approximately  million square feet a  net decrease from the total square footage reported at the end of the first quarter  in terms of our strong balance sheet we ended the quarter with approximately  million in cash and no bank debt before i go through our outlook let me briefly state that we continue to move forward on both our supply chain initiatives which we announced late last year and our sga optimization program which was launched in march as stated previously our objective with both of these initiatives is to enhance our efficiency effectiveness and profitability regarding our supply chain initiative which is expected to be an ongoing process throughout the remainder of  and beyond we expect to realize meaningful benefits beginning in  and building further the following year as we announced back in march once completed we expect to generate at least  million in ongoing annualized gross margin dollars from this initiatives by  our second area of focus reflects our ongoing commitment to aggressively manage our cost structure which is targeted to generate a total of  million in ongoing annualized savings by  of which  million is targeted for  finally before turning to our outlook as you know we announced on may  that ascena retail group and ann inc entered into a definitive merger agreement under which ascena will acquire ann inc through a combination of cash and stock in an accretive transaction upon closing ann inc stockholders will receive  in cash and  of a share of ascena common stock in exchange for each share of ann common stock at closing of the transaction ann inc stockholders will own approximately  of ascena the transaction is expected to close in the second half of  subject to customary closing conditions including among other things the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  and approval of the merger by the holders of majority of the outstanding shares of ann inc the transaction does not require approval by ascena stockholders excluding the potential impact of the aforementioned transaction with ascena the company expects the following for fiscal second quarter of  total net sales are expected to be  million reflecting total company comparable sales that are slightly positive compared to the fiscal second quarter of  our gross margin rate performance is expected to be  selling general and administrative expenses are estimated to be  million our effective tax rate for the quarter is expected to be  and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter are expected to be approximately  million shares which includes the effect of participating securities excluding the potential impact of the aforementioned transaction with ascena the company expects the following for the full year fiscal  fiscal  total net sales are expected to be  billion reflecting a total company comparable sales increase in the low singledigits our gross margin rate performance is expected to be  total sga expenses in fiscal  are expected to be  billion including approximately  million in targeted savings this year associated with our aforementioned sga optimization program our  effective tax rate is expected to be  and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  million our total weighted average square footage for fiscal  is expected to remain approximately flat with  reflecting the opening of approximately  new stores offset by the impact of approximately  store closures and we expect to end the year with approximately  stores regarding our share count we anticipate that our fullyear weighted average diluted shares will be approximately  million shares in  for purposes of modeling eps in  note that this figure excludes the impact of approximately  million participating securities that should be incorporated into your models for a total of approximately  million shares on a weighted average basis and finally we expect to continue to maintain our healthy balance sheet including a disciplined approach to inventory management throughout the fiscal year before we open it up for questions let me remind you that this call is related to the earnings release that we issued this morning we are restricted from communicating on the transaction with ascena at this time and until all of the documents are filed with the securities and exchange commission and with that lets open it up for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question is from kimberly greenberger with morgan stanley kimberly conroy greenberger  morgan stanley  co llc so much good morning katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer good morning kimberly conroy greenberger  morgan stanley  co llc mike and kay im wondering a couple of things on factory kay its sounded like you feel the factory – the ann taylor factory business in q was a little bit of a selfinflicted challenge perhaps q is picking up a bit is it purely selfinflicted or are you seeing sort of broader weak trends in the factory outlet division and then two questions for mike should we exclude from our model any further share repurchases in the second quarter through the fourth quarter and im just wondering now that youve gone through the sort of downsizing of the fleet here over the last several years how are you feeling about the overall size of the fleet and any further actions on that going forward thank you katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer kimberly ill address the factory first both loft outlet and ann taylor factory have definitely been navigating a choppy traffic environment but loft outlet has been able to mitigate this more through the strength of its entire product offering actually and ann taylor factory has definitely had some product challenges particularly in tops and then specifically in knit and woven tops we also had to work through some inventory overhang in the first quarter in ann taylor factory which im glad to say is behind us now we definitely know there is work to do to reposition the offering in atfs with a better balance of classic styling and brand appropriate fashion i dont think we had that right in first quarter so were on it and the business has improved im happy to say so far in may in both channels actually michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer and in terms of your question regarding share repurchases kimberly in light of mondays announcement you should not assume that we will be repurchasing shares during the second quarter or for that matter during the balance of the year and then your third question regarding fleet size youre absolutely correct we feel that we were way ahead of the curve in the domestic retail business in terms of optimizing our fleet size and square footage whether it be overall size of store and the ongoing optimization of the footprint size and were quite frankly purging underperforming stores across ann taylor and loft over the last three years to five years with that said in terms of ability to further refine or optimize the fleet i think its fair to say that we will continue to refine the overall fleet size at the ann taylor fullprice business within loft there will be select repositionings within markets and some incremental square footage growth over time and weve articulated a view externally of a fleet size of approximately  that well be comfortable with in terms of growth with an outlet at this point in time were going to focus on continuing to grow our loft outlet business and directionally were comfortable with the overall fleet size at ann taylor factory kimberly conroy greenberger  morgan stanley  co llc terrific thank you both michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator thank you our next question is from janet kloppenburg with jjk research janet j kloppenburg  jjk research good morning everyone and congratulations to you all katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer thank you janet j kloppenburg  jjk research a couple of questions just for kay first if you could talk about the overall your perspective kay on if fashion trends are stronger this year and if the females appetite for buying apparel it has improved yearoveryear that would help a lot and should we expect that the outlet assortment should gradually improve at ann taylor as we move through the year or do you still think it will be choppy in that division i think you said you turned positive but i just love your perspective there and just clarification business trends in may have improved for both brands from where they were in the first quarter and lastly for mike could you just clarify where we should – given all the timing differences katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer janet one question michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer she has got to give one to michael let it go katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer okay janet j kloppenburg  jjk research its probably our last call so for mike – thank you mike where you think inventory should be at the end of the quarter thank you katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer okay all right janet im going to answer the question about q may  janet j kloppenburg  jjk research yeah thats good katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer so so far this month loft is performing better than ann taylor however we do expect the full price businesses in both brands to comp positive for the quarter loft outlet is doing very well and is expected to deliver a positive comp performance and obviously the loft brand is positive monthtodate and ann taylor factory we expect to remain negative however the comp trends have improved since the first quarter in this channel so things are looking better for sure as far as fashion trends go i would say that bold prints geometric prints florals print – were definitely in a print and pattern and color cycle and color is very very strong as well as white is very strong as far as fashion trends and silhouettes i would say cropped pants are also doing very well too so that question janet j kloppenburg  jjk research thank you kay thank you katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer mike would you like to add some color on whats selling right now michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer kay after working with you for the last sevenplus years i think your merchandising magic has rubbed off on me and as i look at whats selling clearly she is loving our shorts our cropped pants as you mentioned knit dresses fashion tees and sleeveless feminine blouses were selling color very well especially pinks and corals and shades of blue you mentioned patterns bold florals geometric patterns and online believe it or not she continues to search for citron and leopard print janet j kloppenburg  jjk research okay thank you katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer wait a minute michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer im going to answer your inventory question janet so we talked about our end of first quarter inventory position in our prepared remarks where on an allin basis for the company that we finished for the first quarter up about  however when you adjust for timing shifts inventory per square foot was down  and that was really a function of loft on a reported basis they were up  but again if you adjust for timing shifts yearonyear loft was essentially flat i think i mentioned on our call in march that we would be challenged with timing shifts and reported inventory results at end of period in the first half of the year particularly at loft and well be facing that same challenge at the end of the second quarter or going into august however with that said on an adjusted basis we expect inventory to be flat to down across the company and as a reminder in terms of our inventory buy and our unit inventory position the business across both brands and all channels of both brands was positioned flat to down on a yearonyear basis janet j kloppenburg  jjk research thanks so much michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thank you janet operator thank you next question is from neely tamminga with piper jaffray neely j n tamminga  piper jaffray  co broker great good morning and im going to add my congratulations on this transaction that is underway – to both of you and to the board so hey mike can you walk us through a little bit on the cost savings so weve indentified the total of  million between supply chain and sga how much of that have you actually realized yeartodate this year we heard about the  million that you anticipate to realize out of the sga side i believe michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer yes neely j n tamminga  piper jaffray  co broker so what total do you expect between both buckets to be realized this year and then lastly and i think this is an important point for investors right now is the  million that youve indentified contemplated at all in the  million that ascena has actually identified as cost saving synergies our understanding is no but were just wanting to make sure that were crystal on that point thank you michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer sure so the first question in terms of what can we expect to realize from both initiatives in  our guidance does not assume that we recognize or realize any benefit associated with the supply chain initiative in fiscal  again as a reminder weve articulated a view that we believe we have a clearly defined pathway to at least  million of opportunity by yearend  and we expect to realize a significant component of that in  as it relates to the sga initiative weve articulated a view that were targeting  million over the next two years  million of which weve targeted to be realized in  during the first quarter we realized in the neighborhood of approaching  million of sga save so the run rate is clearly there and a tailwind as it relates to realizing at least the  million of opportunity in  as it relates to the synergy view that ascena and david articulated on monday i am not in a position today to make any comment with respect to the synergy opportunity that ascena articulated on monday neely j n tamminga  piper jaffray  co broker thank you michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thank you neely operator thank you next question is from adrienne yih with janney capital markets adrienne eugenia yihtennant  janney montgomery scott llc good morning and let me add my congratulations on the transaction i had a question on auc for mike for the back half if you can comment a little bit on that and then for kay two quick questions one if you can give us an update on the international opportunities and then two weve had several years now where we see strength in q and q and then the opportunity lies in the fourth quarter and im wondering what are you doing differently this year to really capture that and then my final comment is really just its been incredible working with both of you and i really want to thank you for all the hard work that youve done over the years and i hope this isnt our last interaction together but just wanted to thank you katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer thank you adrienne michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer so ill take the auc question as it relates to auc and the sourcing initiative followon to neelys question and the  million that were targeting by  were not anticipating any benefit from that initiative in this fiscal year with that said though we went into  collectively as an enterprise before we had launched the strategic sourcing supply chain initiative with a goal of delivering actual aucs that would be down in the call it low and in some cases approaching midsingle digits but i think its reasonable to think about auc yearonyear on likeforlike product lowsingle digit declines in auc and that is one of the factors that gives us confidence as we move forward over the balance of the year and realizing yearonyear growth in gross margin rate not only the fact that we expect to realize lower product cost on a likeforlike basis but well also have the benefit of the west coast port situation in the prior year compared as a  benefit and then also our inventory position and our buy as we progress through the balance of the year second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter will get progressively more conservative from a unit inventory position yearonyear katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer okay adrienne let me just address real quick fourth quarter its too early to detail product strategies at this time we are buying holiday  as we speak now but were holding more opentobuy than we ever have for this quarter so we can chase into it based on trends and i will say that our inventory levels regarding fourth quarter inventory levels for sure are going to be better controlled than ever before because thats the quarter thats typically our lowest margin quarter and weve learned a lot this year and were on it so its too early and well articulate that maybe in august adrienne eugenia yihtennant  janney montgomery scott llc and then international katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer international were in mexico were still in canada and were expanding a little bit more in mexico were going to have three more franchise stores this year and thats as far as were going at this point adrienne eugenia yihtennant  janney montgomery scott llc great thank you so much katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer more to come adrienne eugenia yihtennant  janney montgomery scott llc thank you operator thank you next question is from dana telsey with telsey advisory group dana l telsey  telsey advisory group llc good morning everyone katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer good morning dana l telsey  telsey advisory group llc as you think about the factory channel overall both for loft and for ann taylor what do you see as the differences in performance for each is there traffic differences is there category performance and on the additional cost savings that you mentioned are there particular buckets that that would fall into thank you michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer sure in terms of traffic differential by brand in the outlet segment during the first quarter loft outlet their traffic was essentially flat on an average store basis yearonyear and at ann taylor factory traffic was down in the lowsingle digits katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer and from a product perspective dana virtually everything worked in loft outlet there was no product weaknesses and in ann taylor factory as i have said for the past two calls theres been significant weakness in the knit and woven top area and that affected the overall business for sure and then so far in may those two categories have improved pretty significantly so we hope were on the mend there and we hope were past the bad performance michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer and then to follow on your question regarding drivers of the cost savings in  i think kay mentioned in her opening comments cost of operating store and store staffing  weve looked at opportunities and have actually begun to implement further opportunities or additional opportunities over the balance of the year where we will focus on nonselling nonclient facing labor hours so were really looking to become even more efficient in store in how we operate the stores and then beyond that we are looking at every dollar of nonmerchandise spend across the enterprise whether it be it costs facility costs or client contact center everything is up for discussion and were aggressively going after opportunities to improve overall service levels while optimizing the overall cost structure dana l telsey  telsey advisory group llc thank you michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator thank you last question for today is from brian tunick with royal bank of canada brian jay tunick  rbc capital markets llc thanks very much ill add my congrats as well i guess kay i have no merchandising questions i guess for you in my last call so i guess a couple of questions for you just starting  on the capex side of the business just be curious if you can talk about your capex spending how much is on the it omnichannel side versus your stores capex and what do you think normalized capex for the business would be and on the distribution center capability how much excess capacity do you still have left in your current facility or number of stores you could add to it and on omnichannel i guess can you remind us what kind of ecommerce fulfillment you guys have outsourced versus what you guys have inhouse just curious as we try to compare the businesses thanks so much guys michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thanks brian judy can you stop writing and hold up the sign so i can recall all of brians questions judith pirro lord  vice presidentinvestor relations normalized capex michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer okay so capex so our framework we guided i believe to  million this year essentially all but  million relates to the store fleet and real estate the balance is predominately it and within it i would say more than two thirds of that spend relates to ongoing investments in our ecommerce platform and ongoing investments to support the evolution of omnichannel in terms of normalized capex i think youve got to take a view on incremental unit growth and how aggressive or not one needs to be if the question relates to maintenance capex i think you could probably get to an outcome that would be below  million and call it in the  million to  million range and potentially close to  million if you were truly on an aggressive conservative maintenance capex view of running the business in terms of omnichannel fulfillment outsourced versus inhouse today all of our fulfillment is outsourced with a bestinclass third party who has been with us and supported us over the years and our massive growth in ecommerce and we continue to work with them to look at opportunities to continue to drive greater efficiencies and speed of delivery to the client and then our store dcs the question was around capacity and we certainly have capacity there we have capacity for another  stores to  stores and so its a valuable asset to the enterprise and the team there we appreciate all the work that they have done for us and continue to do for ann inc and we clearly have an opportunity to support further growth of this business going forward katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer okay that ends our call today we appreciate your continued support and interest in ann inc and you all have a great weekend operator that concludes todays conference call thank you for your participation copyright policy all transcripts on this site

which is available on our website with that let me hand it over to kay katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer good morning everyone thank you for joining us to review our financial results for fourth quarter and fiscal  as well as our strategic growth initiatives and outlook for  for the fourth quarter despite the highly promotional and competitive environment ann inc achieved positive comparable sales and effectively managed expenses to deliver bottomline results that came in slightly ahead of the outlook we provided in november to recap the period total net sales for the quarter increased  to  million up from  million in the fourth quarter last year comparable sales increased  on top of a  increase last year reflecting flat comps for the ann taylor brand and an increase of  for the loft brand the gross margin rate for the quarter was  primarily due to the continued high level of promotional activity across the industry as well as the  basis point impact of incremental air freight costs incurred in response to the west coast port situation sga expenses for the quarter were  million down from  million in the fourth quarter last year our sga rate of  reflected a  basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter of  and is a testament to our continued commitment to efficiently manage our cost structure as well as the ongoing benefit of our strategic realignment announced in march  and lower marketing costs in fact our full year sga rate was our lowest in seven years and gives us a solid foundation as we continue our focus on efficiency and optimizing our cost structure earnings per share for the quarter was  which includes an  per share impact of the incremental freight cost incurred in response to the west coast port situation excluding this impact eps would have been  compared to  in the yearago period overall we entered the fourth quarter prepared for a competitive environment and delivered on our commitment to clear excess inventory and as mike will detail later we have entered  with a conservative inventory plan for the year for the full year  total net sales reached  billion up from  billion in fiscal  our earnings per diluted share for the year as noted in our press release and as mike will discuss later reflected the impact of restructuring and other charges as well as incremental air freight costs excluding these items our adjusted eps for fiscal year  was  compared to eps of  in  while we are disappointed that we could not achieve a sixth consecutive year of eps growth in  im pleased with how our team responded to the many challenges we faced during the year and we are fully committed to restoring positive growth and momentum over the course of  first and foremost this includes a clear focus on delivering outstanding product for our clients through a seamless brand experience at the same time we are committed to carefully controlling inventory levels which is expected to support more fullprice selling and higher gross margin versus  we also will continue to execute on our existing strategic initiatives in addition we are adding new areas of focus that are designed to enable us to compete more effectively perform even more efficiently and drive higher profitability as ill discuss shortly these initiatives include our recently launched supply chain initiatives a new sga optimization program phase  of our omnichannel strategy and the further development of lou  grey these provide meaningful opportunities to increase sales and profitability over the longterm and give us a solid foundation on which to build as we continue our commitment of enhancing shareholder value lets now turn to the brands first ann taylor total net sales for the ann taylor brand for the quarter increased  reflecting flat comps at ann taylor and a decline of  at factory the structured components of the assortment continue to lead the performance with suits skirts outerwear jackets and woven tops all strong in addition our cashmere sweater collection performed well across categories she responded to styles that offered her versatility as you know our team is focused on expanding the versatile components of our offering with products that bridge and transition across the various aspects of her life this will continue to be a priority fashion newness also remains important to her and we continued to achieve success in the fourth quarter without novelty components novelty fabrics and details were particularly well received including leather and fur trim lace and jacquard color continued to sell well however we would have benefited from having a broader color offering with more depth our print assortment was also strong from a marketing perspective ann taylor remains focused on optimizing our various channels to drive higher traffic with fewer marketing dollars while expanding our client reach and share of wallet we have been particularly pleased with the results of our digital and social media campaigns which have allowed us to reach a broader audience the team is continuing to test new initiatives and increasingly using crm data and new technologies to target our investments where we see the greatest opportunity turning now to factory during the fourth quarter total sales in this channel benefited from increased traffic and higher conversions although comps were down slightly in addition the margin rate was pressured by the increased promotional activity driven by both the overall environment as well as our commitment to clear through inventory particularly in knit tops nonetheless this channel continues to be highly profitable our focus will remain on carefully managing our inventory position and maximizing their bottom line contribution looking ahead our team is focused on driving higher productivity and profitability at the ann taylor brand in  and beyond we have identified opportunities to broaden the appeal of the brand reach new clients and drive market share growth work is underway to evolve our product and merchandising strategy to take advantage of these opportunities as we move through the year key to our success will be continuing to perform well in the structured categories and to win in tops a category that currently represents a significant percentage of the ann taylors business we have begun to evolve the assortment to offer her a more balanced selection with greater diversity and more versatility to meet multiple wear occasions having the right fashion is also key and as i mentioned in november we are increasingly using our test and chase capabilities in order to be more fashionright and optimize fullprice sellthrough at the same time we also know a flattering fit is important to her so were taking steps to further enhance the fit and help ensure that we have the right balance in our style offering in tops especially in silhouettes necklines and price points finally we are focused on opportunities to increase the versatile component of the entire offering in order to expand our appeal to a broader universe of women for spring we are offering more fashion and more color the fashion component is up from fourth quarter and a year ago while color for the spring season is more than double fourth quarter and up significantly from last year print and pattern will also be higher year on year in summary we feel were headed down the right path with strategies in place to improve performance as we progress through  were excited about the initiatives underway to evolve and expand the ann taylor brand turning now to loft total sales for the loft brand for the quarter increased  reflecting comparable sales increases of  at loft and approximately  at loft outlet woven tops dresses skirts pants and accessories all generated positive comps for the quarter among the standouts were cotton shirts feminine blouses corduroy and ponte pants sweater dresses and novelty skirts in addition we are excited that lou  grey continues to deliver positive comp performance we are also pleased that performance in knit tops strengthened sequentially reflecting our focus on offering her a more balanced fashion assortment as we noted on our last call weve taken steps to rightsize our investment utilize smaller more frequent buys reallocate our fabric mix and incorporate more test and chase we feel confident were on the right track color print and pattern continued to perform well during the quarter as well as lace textured knits jacquards and tweeds from a marketing perspective loft continues to be innovative in engaging its clients in new ways and across multiple channels to further increase brand awareness drive traffic and foster retentions loft has been particularly successful with its online strategies incorporating digital outreach and social media we look forward to continuing to broaden the universe of loyal loft clients and growing our relationship with existing clients turning now to loft outlet total sales for the fourth quarter rose  driven by yearoveryear store growth as well as a  comp increase this strong performance despite a challenging traffic environment reflected a compelling product offering that drove higher aur dpt and conversion in addition loft outlet delivered a strong gross margin rate which was further supported by a disciplined inventory position as we continue to manage our inventory investment in this channel to maximize profitability and bottom line contribution looking ahead loft is well positioned for the spring season with new and exciting fashion and everyday essentials all at great value fashion represents a higher percentage of the mix from a year ago and we also increased the color print and pattern penetration from last spring in addition we feel good about the improvement in knit tops and the work were doing to drive stronger profitability across the tops category which is a major area of focus for  in that regard we are taking steps first to adjust the balance of the assortment between knits sweaters and wovens second to increase the fashion component as well as color print and pattern and third to add more diversity of style in silhouette all of which are expected to strengthen our overall results in summary the loft brand is well positioned for growth as the goto destination for her everyday wardrobe needs at surprising prices we look forward to further expanding the brands reach increasing its market share and attracting a broader following of loyal loft clients lets now turn to our strategic growth initiatives for  ill start by recapping some of our overarching thoughts which provide context for our specific initiatives put very simply there are three things needed to succeed in todays retail environment compelling product a seamless brand experience with multiple touch points and a highly responsive efficient and flexible operating structure our  efforts address each of these areas the first of these delivering compelling product has been partially covered by my earlier comments on the  strategies for ann taylor and loft and i will discuss lou  grey momentarily as always design and merchandising are at the very top of our list as we continue to differentiate and evolve our brands in an everchanging marketplace the second overarching ingredient for success is creating a seamless and engaging experience for our clients in many respects our brands are defined by her experience in our stores and online how we engage with her across channels as you know we were an early adopter of omnichannel technology through the launch of our platform in  and we have continued to enhance our capabilities ever since including an improved mobile experience our upcoming phase  rollout and continued improvements in site speed functionality and aesthetics finally we are highly focused on continuing to operate more nimbly and efficiently the retail sector has evolved dramatically in recent years and we have been ahead of the curve in taking action to best position the company for the future for example we were among the first to optimize our store portfolio during the  to  timeframe and more recently to adopt an integrated stores ecommerce organizational structure as part of our strategic realignment last march and we continue our journey we are focused on new opportunities to enhance profitability and evolve the business in todays dynamic retail environment so lets turn to specifics first supply chain launched last november this initiative is focused on identifying opportunities to improve our production speed and flexibility increase product sellthrough and reduce cost of goods sold in order to enhance corporate profitability as mike will address this work is continuing as we evaluate all aspects of our supply chain and we anticipate generating at least  million of annualized incremental gross margin dollars by  second our new sga optimization program this program is incremental to the strategic realignment we completed in  which generated annualized pretax cost savings of approximately  million  million of which were realized in  following the success of that program we are reviewing our operations in  to identify additional opportunities to further increase our efficiency and lower cost we are currently targeted ongoing annualized savings of an additional  million by  associated with this new program together our supply chain and sga initiatives are expected to contribute meaningfully to the companys profitability third omnichannel we continue to make significant progress in offering a seamless shopping experience across all channels we are particularly pleased with the strong response to our enhanced mobile capabilities which was launched at both brands in the third quarter in fact conversion rates on mobile devices are up nearly  reflecting a more userfriendly experience for our clients weve also seen much success with the piloting of our endless aisle capabilities and in select ann taylor and loft stores as you know the second phase of our omnichannel strategy gives our client access to online product from the store environment based on the successful pilot we are moving ahead with the rollout across both brands and expect all of our ann taylor and loft stores to have this capability by the end of second quarter fourth lou  grey weve made significant strides with our newest concept and continue to be very excited about its growth potential at year end we operated five freestanding stores at boston atlanta raleigh pasadena and san jose and our plans call for adding a handful of new locations in  in addition we are working on a standalone lou  grey ecommerce site that is scheduled to launch this summer the freestanding store have provided a great environment for refining the lou  grey concept real time and importantly they have been successful in attracting clients who are new to ann inc in addition the stores have been operating on a full price basis despite the promotional environment overall we look forward to continuing to grow lou  grey and bringing a casual effortless style to more women in summary we have meaningful initiatives underway for  and beyond which we fully expect will contribute to stronger performance longterm growth and enhance value for our shareholders finally before handing it over to mike i would like to thank our associates for their dedication and hard work during  in a challenging environment we look forward to the significant opportunities for our company and our brands in  and now let me turn it over to mike michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thanks kay and good morning everyone today ill start with a summary of results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal  and then ill provide you some perspective on our outlook for  i will also address our supply chain initiatives and sga optimization program well start with a recap of the fourth quarter beginning with net sales net sales for the fourth quarter were  million an increase of approximately  versus the  million in net sales reported in the fourth quarter of  by brand net sales across all channels of the ann taylor brand were  million an increase of  when compared with  million reported last year at the loft brand net sales were  million reflecting  growth over the  million reported last year moving on to comps total company comparable sales for the quarter increased  on top of the  increase in the fourth quarter of  at the ann taylor brand total brand comps declined  reflecting flat comps at ann taylor and a  decline in the factory outlet channel at the loft brand total brand comps increased  reflecting increases of  at loft and  at loft outlet turning now to gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales was  down  basis points when compared to the  rate achieved in last years fourth quarter our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter of  reflected a higher level of promotional activity both as a result of external pressures and our desire to clear holiday inventories ahead of spring product deliveries as well as  basis points of erosion related to the west coast port situation turning now to sga sga expenses in the fourth quarter were  million compared with  million reported in the fourth quarter of  our sga as a percentage of net sales was  a  basis point improvement from the  in the fourth quarter of last year this rate reflected continued disciplined expense management including the ongoing benefits associated with our restructuring in the first quarter of  as well as lower marketing spend operating income during the fourth quarter was  million as mentioned in our third quarter call we incurred  million in incremental air freight costs in response to the situation at the west coast ports during the fourth quarter which impacted our operating income performance excluding these costs operating income would have been  million compared with operating income of  million in the fourth quarter of  net income in the quarter was  million or  per diluted share including the  million or  per diluted share aftertax impact associated with the west coast port situation without which net income would have been  million or  per diluted share this compares with net income of  million or  per diluted share in the fourth quarter of  moving on to our share count weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter decreased  to  million shares versus  million shares in the fourth quarter of  our fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the benefit of certain tax credits as a result of the extension of legislation during the quarter and compares with an effective tax rate of  in the fourth quarter of  depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter totaled approximately  million compared with  million reported in the fourth quarter of  and finally capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled  million compared with  million in the fourth quarter of  turning now to a quick recap of the full year results net sales for fiscal  increased  versus last year to  billion on an overall comp decline of  at ann taylor total sales across the brand decreased approximately  to  million compared with  million in  and comparable sales declined  versus last years positive comp of  at the loft brand total sales increased approximately  to  billion in  compared with  billion in  comparable sales decreased  versus last years positive comp of  our gross margin rate for the year was  as compared to the  achieved in fiscal  our gross margin results for  were negatively impacted by continued traffic challenges and a highly competitive retail environment which caused us to be more promotional at both brands in order to clear through inventory as well as soft product performance in select categories at loft during the first half of the year and at ann taylor during the second half of  gross margin also reflected approximately  basis points of impact related to incremental air freight costs incurred in response to the west coast port situation in the back half of  sga expenses for the year were  billion which includes the impact of the third quarter pretax charge of  million associated with the closure of ann taylors madison avenue store excluding this charge sga for the year would have been  billion compared with  billion in fiscal  as a percentage of sales sga was  excluding the impact of the aforementioned charge sga as a percentage of sales would have been  representing a  basis points reduction compared with  and our lowest rate since  the improvement in sga rate was primarily due to lower marketing expense and performancebased compensation as well as our ongoing disciplined expense management including savings associated with our first quarter  restructuring during fiscal  we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  in connection with our strategic realignment in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a  million pretax charge or  per diluted share associated with the closure of ann taylors madison avenue store and finally during the back half of  we incurred  million in incremental air freight costs in response to the west coast port situation which impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately  for fiscal  reported operating income was  million on a gaap basis excluding the aforementioned charges and costs operating income for the full year of fiscal  would have been  million compared with operating income of  million in fiscal  net income for the year was  million or  per diluted share on a gaap basis excluding the combined effect of the aforementioned charges and costs net income would have been  million or  per diluted share in fiscal  compared with net income of  million or  per diluted share in fiscal  our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year decreased  to  million shares versus  million shares in  primarily reflecting the repurchase of  million shares during  our effective tax rate for the year was  versus  for  our lower rate is primarily due to the benefit of certain tax credits taken in fiscal  related to current and prior open periods depreciation and amortization in  totaled  million versus  million in  capital expenditures for the year totaled approximately  million versus approximately  million in  moving on now to the details of our fiscal yearend inventory total inventory per square foot at the end of fiscal  increased approximately  versus fiscal  reflecting increases of  at ann taylor and  at loft partially offset by a  decrease in the factory outlet channel the increases at ann taylor and loft were primarily driven by a change in the timing of spring receipts versus last year as well as changes in merchandise mix excluding the impact of receipt timing inventory per square foot was up  at ann taylor and  at loft as compared to fiscal  looking ahead our inventory plans for the full year  reflect a conservative view with unit receipt plans that are flat to down versus last year in all channels at both brands and we entered the first quarter of  with minimal carryover and  of our inventory reflecting fresh spring product at both ann taylor and loft turning now to store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened a total of  stores comprised of three ann taylor stores eight ann taylor factory stores  loft stores  loft outlet stores and five lou  grey stores we closed a total of  stores during the year comprised of  ann taylor stores and  loft stores the total store count at the end of the fiscal year was  stores comprised of  ann taylor stores  ann taylor factory stores  loft stores  loft outlet stores and five lou  grey stores our store square footage at the end of the year totaled approximately  million square feet a  net decrease from the total square footage at the end of fiscal  turning now to our real estate plans for  looking ahead we continue to see opportunity for thoughtful investment in the growth of our fleet in  at the same time we are mindful of the expansion of our omnichannel business and the evolving retail environment in fact you have already seen us take action to refine ann taylors brickandmortar footprint over the past few years we are firm believers in the integration of stores and ecommerce and this will be a primary factor guiding our real estate decisions in  and beyond in keeping with that our store opening plans are focused on lowcost highreturn markets including the continuation of our loft small midmarket strategy and incremental growth in the factory outlet channel in total we expect to open approximately  stores in  comprised of  new ann taylor factory stores  loft fullprice stores and approximately  loft outlet stores we will also continue our regional and market testing for lou  grey through the opening of approximately five new stores from an international perspective we expect the addition of approximately five loft franchise stores in mexico regarding store closure plans for  we currently expect to close approximately  stores during the fiscal year comprised of approximately  ann taylor stores and approximately  loft stores with the majority of these closures slated to occur in the back half of  as i mentioned earlier we will remain disciplined in terms of continuing to assess the environment as our omnichannel business and market structure evolve and as always we will continue to manage our real estate portfolio to maximize store profitability and ensure brand presence in key regions and markets in terms of our strong balance sheet after share repurchases totaling  million in fiscal  we ended the year with cash of  million and no bank debt we remain committed to using our strong balance sheet and free cash flow to further enhance shareholder value in  before i go through our outlook let me walk through some of the actions we took in  and those we will be taking in this coming year that are expected to benefit our efficiency effectiveness and profitability in  and beyond first our supply chain initiatives we announced the launch of a comprehensive endtoend assessment of our supply chain four months ago coming out of that deep dive we entered  with a clear plan that we will be executing throughout the year between now and  we expect to generate approximately  million or the equivalent of approximately  basis points in ongoing annualized benefits to gross margin from a timing perspective we anticipate meaningful improvement will begin in  and build further the following year and the highlights of this initiative include the following first enhancing our strategic sourcing efforts including regional repositioning more effective negotiations for goods and services and pursuing opportunities to further leverage scale second improving our material management including expanding our fabric platforming capabilities reducing spend for related supplies and materials and further consolidating our mill base third implementing brand and channel appropriate product engineering opportunities to ensure we are protecting quality where it counts and getting paid for our investment and finally fourth assessing opportunities to use agents where it make sense and complements our direct sourcing model in summary were using bestinclass industry benchmarks to ensure that our sourcing and supply chain function is highly efficient and nimble with an overarching goal to improve our production speed and flexibility increasing product sellthrough and reducing overall cost of goods sold in order to enhance ann incs corporate profitability our second area of focus reflects our ongoing commitment to aggressively manage sga as you may recall we announced a strategic realignment last march which we completed in  as kay mentioned this restructuring generated approximately  million in ongoing annualized savings  million of which we realized in fiscal  today we have announced the launch of a new sga optimization program which reflects a continuation of our efforts to best position ann inc for success in a dynamic market by indentifying further opportunities to enhance our efficiency we believe this program will enable ann inc to compete even more effectively by refocusing our resources we are targeting total annualized program savings at approximately  million  million of which is targeted for  and which is incorporated into our  outlook with that as backdrop i will now turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full year of  overall we expect the external challenges of the second half of  will continue to impact the first half of  and you should anticipate that we will continue our disciplined approach to expenses as well as our efforts to identify opportunities to operate even more efficiently throughout the year for the fiscal first quarter of  we expect total net sales to be  million reflecting comparable sales that are slightly positive versus the first quarter of  our gross margin rate is expected to be  selling general and administrative expenses are expected to be  million we estimate our effective tax rate for the first quarter will be  and weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter will be  million including the effect of participating securities however this does not include any impact of potential share repurchases during the period turning now to the full year outlook we expect fiscal  total net sales to be  billion reflecting a comparable sales increase in the low singledigits gross margin rate performance is expected to be  full year sga expenses are expected to be  billion which includes approximately  million of targeted savings in fiscal  associated with our new sga optimization program we expect an annual effective tax rate of  regarding our share count we anticipate that our full year weighted average diluted shares will be approximately  million in  for the purposes of modeling eps in  note that this figure excludes the impact of approximately  million participating securities that should be incorporated into your models for a total of approximately  million shares on a weighted average basis however this does not include the potential impact of future share repurchases capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  million representing a more than  decrease in capex as compared with  and reflects the following investments first  million in support of approximately  new stores second  million to support our omnichannel growth and technology capabilities and third  million for store renovation and refurbishment programs total weighted average square footage for fiscal  is expected to remain approximately flat with  reflecting the opening of approximately  stores offset by the impact of approximately  store closures and as always we expect to remain and maintain our healthy balance sheet including a conservative approach to inventory management throughout fiscal  and with that ill turn it back to kay katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer it was important for us to get our strategies and initiatives for  out there and we know our remarks were longer than usual this morning so well be holding our call a few minutes longer this morning to facilitate your questions lets now open it up operator questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from janet kloppenburg with jjk research you may ask your question janet j kloppenburg  jjk research good morning everyone and congratulations on the progress kay i was wondering if you could talk about your merchandising execution at both loft and ann and if given all of the lengthy agenda you have novelty and versatility if there has been any changes to that team or any changes to the process in terms of lead times thanks so much katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer well janet let me first just say that february started out slower than anticipated obviously due to the weather we had – we experienced a mid singledigit negative comp performance in february and as you can imagine the negative weather impacts we experienced across the vast majority of our fleet but positive comp performance for the month in our warm weather stores and with the lions share of the quarter still ahead of us we are encouraged by the return of positive comp sales in march at both brands as the weather has improved and what were seeing happening in ann and loft right now is color is selling incredibly well in ann the color coral and blush are selling prints and animals and floral prints are all selling moto jackets outerwear feminine blouses ankle pants and twofer sweaters in loft exciting knit tops especially our vintage tee and mixed fabric tops are all selling very well so were excited about that business improving feminine blouses our soft utility shirt are all doing well and pants in general are really on the uptick be it ankle pants fluids pants white denim were selling them all very well geometric lace details are selling well in loft right now and we have a lot of lace and eyelet trims coming in later in both brands and shes loving the color citron so were off to a good start in march we think that the business definitely is going to continue to improve as you know were an easter brand so we fully anticipate everything getting a little bit better so we are highly focused on the versatility factor of our assortment we know how important that is we know we have to focus on versatility but at the same time wardrobing is the hallmark of both brands so that careful balance is really critical to our success so we feel like were off to a good start operator thank you our next question comes from kimberly greenberger with morgan stanley you may ask your question kimberly conroy greenberger  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you my question is on inventory kay you talked about a more disciplined approach to inventory management here in  and understanding if there were some timing differences here in the fourth quarter number were looking at the  and the  numbers you quoted excluding those timing shifts would that be representative of how youre buying inventory through spring summer and fall or is that even higher than what your outlook is in terms of your total inventory buy as you progress through the year thanks michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thanks for the question kimberly its mike ill take that one so the adjusted endofperiod results of up  and up  on a dollars per square foot basis are absolutely not reflective of how were buying and how were positioning the business both brands both on a full frontline full price basis as well as a factory outlet basis in all cases both brands and both channels within both brands we are positioning the business on a unit basis flat to down last year so on an adjusted basis end of year on a reported adjusted basis the up  and up  is not reflective of how were positioning the business were positioning the business flat to down on a unit basis and were absolutely focused on executing a plan with lower levels of promotional activity over the course of  regaining realized aur and regaining gross margin that we lost over the course of  operator your next question comes from dana telsey from telsey advisory group you may ask your question dana l telsey  telsey advisory group llc hi can you hear me michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer sure we can dana l telsey  telsey advisory group llc okay can you just talk a little – on the renewed sga plans that you have on expense reduction what is the targeted sga number that you look out to over the next few years and also as you think about the store base target too especially given the lou  grey opportunity thank you michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer great question dana so we have not publicly disclosed or shared a longterm view of sga rate but the fact that our result in  was the lowest rate since  i think is truly a testament to our commitment to aggressively manage expenses here at ann inc its early days in terms of this broadbased sga optimization initiative initially our thinking is that we clearly have opportunity to further optimize cost of operating in store as well as on the nonmerchandise procurement side so as i think about the  million of sga savings that weve incorporated into our  outlook at this point the vast majority will come from areas like how we operate in store as well as nonmerchandise procurement in terms of real estate footprint looking forward from an ann taylor fullprice perspective over the next couple years i actually think that we will continue to shed unproductive lower performing stores in the case of loft fullprice weve actually previously articulated runway to  domestic fullprice stores and were still focused and continuing to grow in the mid and small market arena on the outlet front we are focused on continuing to build ann taylor factory to approximately  store chain domestically and in terms of loft outlet we believe we have a clear runway to  stores finally your question regarding lou  grey we continue to look at lou  grey as a test and learn opportunity were encouraged with what we see in its early days both as a standalone concept as well as a highly productive concept inside the four walls of loft and id also like to share with you that we will be launching a new lou  grey standalone website later this year and our target is by the end of the second quarter dana l telsey  telsey advisory group llc thank you michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from adrienne yih with janney capital markets you may ask your question adrienne eugenia yihtennant  janney montgomery scott llc good morning nice to hear that the comps have returned as the weather has mike my question i believe is for you its about the use of the vendors and moving from the more traditional vertical sourcing that youve done specifically can you give us any indication of how much more expensive it is on the buy to shift to the vendors but then how much more time and the benefit of what you get back from the intransit that kind of dynamic there over time also how much vendor penetration do you think that you can shift toward thank you very much michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer sure so i think in terms of migrating the model and i talked about the opportunity for us to use agents use third parties where it makes sense and we really view it as an opportunity as a complement to our existing direct sourcing model we dont anticipate adrienne really any significant incremental product cost in fact we believe we can continue to drive efficiency and overall auc reduction and really were thinking about it as an opportunity to complement what our existing internal merchant and design teams develop as well as enable us to respond faster to marketplace demand so thats how were thinking about this opportunity today and longer term adrienne eugenia yihtennant  janney montgomery scott llc okay and then really quickly did you talk about port impact for this quarter i know you gave guidance but did you specifically call it out for q michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer i didnt but thats a great question so its all reflected in our outlook for  and in the first quarter as well as our very specific first quarter framework so in terms of the first quarter in our outlook were anticipating about a  million or  negative impact to the first quarter of  and a similar impact in the second quarter of  and beyond that sitting here today were fully anticipating that the west coast port will clear in the next eight to  weeks and by the time we reach the third quarter were not anticipating that we will have to continue to incur this incremental impact but with all that said again i want to reinforce the impacts of the first and second quarter of  of  million per quarter or  per quarter is reflected in the outlook that we shared today adrienne eugenia yihtennant  janney montgomery scott llc wonderful best of luck michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator thank you and our last question comes from betty chen with mizuho securities you may ask your question betty chen  mizuho securities usa inc thank you good morning everyone congrats on a nice quarter and momentum into spring katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer thank you betty chen  mizuho securities usa inc i was wondering if you can give us some additional help regarding the cadence of some of the savings especially the ones that well be taking in this year and then i guess if i could squeeze in a quick one it sounds like structured product continues to be a strength at the ann taylor brand and our recollection is that its a quite important category for the business can you remind us what that percentage or penetration may be and whether youre also seeing new customers especially gravitating towards that collection since its such a unique product in the marketplace thanks michael j nicholson  executive vice president chief operating officer chief financial officer and treasurer sure betty ill take the first one in terms of sga so again our full year outlook reflects the anticipation of  million of sga savings associated with the sga optimization initiatives that we launched today as it relates to the rampup im not really expecting significant savings or opportunity in the first quarter and again that thinking is reflected in our first quarter outlook and i would expect to begin to ramp in q with the vast majority of the savings being realized in the back half of  katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer and betty as far as the structured components in the ann taylor brand its including dresses i would say versatile separates and suites and dresses its about  of the total and those elements have been doing well in ann taylor that really is what she comes to us for weve seen success in those categories and where our focus is for this year and next is to really regain the tops business and a lot of our emphasis and lot of our work is in that area so structured is really okay betty chen  mizuho securities usa inc okay thank you best of luck katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer okay thanks katherine lawther krill  president  chief executive officer thanks you everyone we appreciate your
