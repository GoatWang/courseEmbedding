melcancervac® melcancervac®—polyvalent vaccine targeting shared tumorspecific antigens this page is an excerpt from the research section “vaccine platform” the main product of dandrit biotech usa inc is melcancervac® which uses a patient’s own dendritic cells loaded with tumor antigens from the lysate of a specifically selected melanoma cell line the melanoma cell line expresses a broad spectrum of cancertestis antigens in particular the antigens of the mage family and has low levels of expression of the melanocyte differentiation antigens the original cell line used for the selection was isolated from a patient with a longlasting diseasefree period after the removal of a metastatic tumor reflecting the natural high immunogenicity of these particular melanoma cells the melanoma cell line has been tested for safety and was found to be free of infectious agents the melanoma cell lysate is combined with the patient’s own dendritic cells the method of dendritic cell generation was initially optimized in order to increase the capacity of immature dendritic cells to load the exogenous antigens and present them for recognition by t lymphocytes the method was also optimized to increase the efficiency of transformation of monocytes into dendritic cells and permits us to produce up to five portions of vaccine using only  ml of a patient’s blood in preclinical studies performed in vitro dendritic cells loaded with melanoma cell lysate were able to stimulate the generation of cytotoxic t lymphocytes with broad antitumor specificity this demonstrated that dandrit’s dendritic cell system is capable of inducing an immune response against shared tumorrestricted antigens expressed in many types of solid tumors the extent of tumor cell death was correlated with the number of expressed antigens of the mage family the main group of the cancertestis antigens these data indicate that the lysate of our melanoma cell lines could be used for treatment of many kinds of solid tumors where cancertestis antigens are expressed in significant amounts for information on obtaining the product see the section “how do i get melcancervac®” melcancervac® melcancervac® mcv is a

competition why septic tank and drainfield systems clog untreated or poorly maintained septic systems can develop severe biomat undigested raw sewage and grime buildup throughout the entire system including the tank lines cesspit sand mound leach field and drain field this accumulated sludge builds up gradually causing performance to degrade steadily which eventually results in drainage failure septic tank systems that have not been properly treated or have had a decrease in bacterial populations due to everyday cleaners and other common household chemicals have a difficult time digesting and degrading the raw septic sewage that enters the tank most systems see problems in the drain field where the field lines progressively clog to a point where waste breakdown and digestion is inhibited these lines have small perforations that allow liquids to pass into the surrounding gravel bed where they further digest and degrade in trouble systems the soil surrounding the septic drainage area piping becomes extremely compacted with sludge and waste at that point the undigested sewage and liquids have no where to go leading to backups wet spots and odors as clogging continues sewage waste may leak out of your septic drain field or even back into your home causing serious septic system problems slow flushing toilets raw sewage odors and wet areas are potentially a sign of an imminent backup a clogged drain field can either be replaced can cost upwards of five to thirty thousand dollars or bombarded with potent sewage eating bacteria that will digest the sludge

drain fields cesspits leach fields and sand mounds see how ntmax stacks up against the competition why septic tank and drainfield systems clog untreated or poorly maintained septic systems can develop severe biomat undigested raw sewage and grime buildup throughout the entire system including the tank lines cesspit sand mound leach field and drain field this accumulated sludge builds up gradually causing performance to degrade steadily which eventually results in drainage failure septic tank systems that have not been properly treated or have had a decrease in bacterial populations due to everyday cleaners and other common household chemicals have a difficult time digesting and degrading the raw septic sewage that enters the tank most systems see problems in the drain field where the field lines progressively clog to a point where waste breakdown and digestion is inhibited these lines have small perforations that allow liquids to pass into the surrounding gravel bed where they further digest and degrade in trouble systems the soil surrounding the septic drainage area piping becomes extremely compacted with sludge and waste at that point the undigested sewage and liquids have no where to go leading to backups wet spots and odors as clogging continues sewage waste may leak out of your septic drain field or even back into your home causing serious septic system problems slow flushing toilets raw sewage odors and wet areas are potentially a sign of an imminent backup a clogged drain field can either be replaced can cost upwards of five to thirty thousand dollars or
