star laboratory to commercialize the speakerindependent speech recognition technology developed for the us government at sri based in menlo park california nuance deployed their first commercial largescale speech application in  their initial route to market was through call center automation call centers had just centralized the branchoffice telephone handling function throughout many large companies the highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff early projects were completely developed by nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits early nuance applications ran on windows ntbased and solaris operating systems and commonly relied on dialogic boards for the telephony hardware in  nuance was spun off from sris star lab two years later nuance deployed its first commercial speech application on  april  nuance filed an initial public offering ipo on the nasdaq under the symbol nuan on  november  nuance acquired speechfront voice instant messaging company for  million in cash and stock in simple terms the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases its key advantage over technologies such as viavoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker this permitted the use of the system socalled speakerindependent naturallanguage speech recognition abbreviated as sinlsr or just nlsr for call automationcitation needed the limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases in complex systems this could be in the low millions at the time these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity intel x servers until the early scitation needed during the late s and into the s nuance competed against other nlsr vendors including philips speechpearl speechworks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as vocalis in the uk which used proprietary pci cards with dsps on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system each speechrecognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself languages are modeled samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model the higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user especially in complex interactions different language models were required for different dialects such as flemish being a variant of dutch or swiss german being a dialect of high german different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection europes philips had by far the largest language coverage which included flemish and welsh later nuance sold licenses training and consulting to their technology to third parties including independent software vendors and interactive voice response ivr vendors who would build applications on top of an ivr platform speechworks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners the technology was integrated into most of the leading ivr products from avaya nortel periphonics envox syntellect and many others the requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of unix nuance  was launched in the late s and was an efficient networkdistributed nlsr speech recognition solution it ran on unix and windows nuance  added statistical language modeling an adaption of

computer products inc to develop the first omnifont optical characterrecognition system—a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font in  kurzweil sold his company to xerox the company became known as xerox imaging systems xis and later scansoft in march  a new company called visioneer inc was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products such as a sheetfed scanner called papermax and the document management software paperport visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to primax electronics ltd in january  two months later in march visioneer acquired scansoft from xerox to form a new public company with scansoft as the new companywide name prior to  scansoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as textbridge paperport and omnipage beginning with the december  acquisition of lernout  hauspie the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with nuance nuance history prior to the  merger with scansoftedit nuance was founded in  as a spinoff of sri internationals speech technology and research star laboratory to commercialize the speakerindependent speech recognition technology developed for the us government at sri based in menlo park california nuance deployed their first commercial largescale speech application in  their initial route to market was through call center automation call centers had just centralized the branchoffice telephone handling function throughout many large companies the highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff early projects were completely developed by nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits early nuance applications ran on windows ntbased and solaris operating systems and commonly relied on dialogic boards for the telephony hardware in  nuance was spun off from sris star lab two years later nuance deployed its first commercial speech application on  april  nuance filed an initial public offering ipo on the nasdaq under the symbol nuan on  november  nuance acquired speechfront voice instant messaging company for  million in cash and stock in simple terms the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases its key advantage over technologies such as viavoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker this permitted the use of the system socalled speakerindependent naturallanguage speech recognition abbreviated as sinlsr or just nlsr for call automationcitation needed the limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases in complex systems this could be in the low millions at the time these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity intel x servers until the early scitation needed during the late s and into the s nuance competed against other nlsr vendors including philips speechpearl speechworks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as vocalis in the uk which used proprietary pci cards with dsps on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system each speechrecognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself languages are modeled samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model the higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user especially in complex interactions different language models were required for different dialects such as flemish being a variant of dutch or swiss german being a dialect of high german different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection europes philips had by far the largest language coverage which included flemish and welsh later nuance sold licenses training and consulting to their technology to third parties including independent software vendors and interactive voice response ivr vendors who would build applications on top of an ivr platform speechworks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners the technology was integrated into most of the leading ivr products from avaya nortel periphonics envox syntellect and many others the requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of unix nuance  was launched in the late s and was an efficient networkdistributed nlsr speech recognition solution it ran on unix and windows nuance  added statistical language modeling an adaption of technologies used in technologies such as viavoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity nuance x series also introduced the wc vocabulary definition language grxml in addition to and eventual replacement of nuances proprietary and very concise grammar specification language gsl nuance  was the last point release before the takeover by scansoft these systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as viavoice which is now also a nuance productcitation needed while nuance marketed their technology at callcenter exhibitions they rarely delivered solutions directly instead nuance relied on telecommunications partners such as nortel periphonics avaya and syntellect nuance realised that designing and developing speechbased solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional dtmf solutions for a couple of years prior to the takeover by scansoft nuance started selling products directly including their callrouting product call steering which determined the skill group required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller nuance  is the first release excluding service packs of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including philips speech pearl speechworks nuance recognizer and others further information is not known about this product partnership with the siri and apple incedit siri is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced naturallanguage processing the artificial intelligence which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload allows software to understand words and their intentions telephony application processedit user invokes the telephony application for call automation application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software user speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct recognizer processedit determines the start of speech input uses audio techniques to remove background noise slices the audio into small sections  to  ms in length determines the sound in each slice matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrasescitation needed topologyedit a typical nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started often monitored by a sixth application nlm nuance license manager kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use recclient recognition client it is the interface between the ivr speech path and the speech recognizing software the recserver the recclient can be developed into the ivr software resourcemanager distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide faulttolerance recserver where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary grammarcompiler an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition watchdog a windows service or unix daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes restarting them if required except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers the other processes may be spread over a farm of servers connected by an ip network with low latency and highbandwidth usually a dedicated lan segment the resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized acquisitionsedit prior to the  merger scansoft

adopted the nuance name for a decade prior to that the two companies competed in the commercial largescale speech application business scansoft originsedit in  raymond kurzweil founded the kurzweil computer products inc to develop the first omnifont optical characterrecognition system—a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font in  kurzweil sold his company to xerox the company became known as xerox imaging systems xis and later scansoft in march  a new company called visioneer inc was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products such as a sheetfed scanner called papermax and the document management software paperport visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to primax electronics ltd in january  two months later in march visioneer acquired scansoft from xerox to form a new public company with scansoft as the new companywide name prior to  scansoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as textbridge paperport and omnipage beginning with the december  acquisition of lernout  hauspie the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with nuance nuance history prior to the  merger with scansoftedit nuance was founded in  as a spinoff of sri internationals speech technology and research star laboratory to commercialize the speakerindependent speech recognition technology developed for the us government at sri based in menlo park california nuance deployed their first commercial largescale speech application in  their initial route to market was through call center automation call centers had just centralized the branchoffice telephone handling function throughout many large companies the highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff early projects were completely developed by nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits early nuance applications ran on windows ntbased and solaris operating systems and commonly relied on dialogic boards for the telephony hardware in  nuance was spun off from sris star lab two years later nuance deployed its first commercial speech application on  april  nuance filed an initial public offering ipo on the nasdaq under the symbol nuan on  november  nuance acquired speechfront voice instant messaging company for  million in cash and stock in simple terms the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases its key advantage over technologies such as viavoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker this permitted the use of the system socalled speakerindependent naturallanguage speech recognition abbreviated as sinlsr or just nlsr for call automationcitation needed the limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases in complex systems this could be in the low millions at the time these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity intel x servers until the early scitation needed during the late s and into the s nuance competed against other nlsr vendors including philips speechpearl speechworks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as vocalis in the uk which used proprietary pci cards with dsps on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system each speechrecognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself languages are modeled samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model the higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user especially in complex interactions different language models were required for different dialects such as flemish being a variant of dutch or swiss german being a dialect of high german different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection europes philips had by far the largest language coverage which included flemish and welsh later nuance sold licenses training and consulting to their technology to third parties including independent software vendors and interactive voice response ivr vendors who would build applications on top of an ivr platform speechworks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners the technology was integrated into most of the leading ivr products from avaya nortel periphonics envox syntellect and many others the requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of unix nuance  was launched in the late s and was an efficient networkdistributed nlsr speech recognition solution it ran on unix and windows nuance  added statistical language modeling an adaption of technologies used in technologies such as viavoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity nuance x series also introduced the wc vocabulary definition language grxml in addition to and eventual replacement of nuances proprietary and very concise grammar specification language gsl nuance  was the last point release before the takeover by scansoft these systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as viavoice which is now also a nuance productcitation needed while nuance marketed their technology at callcenter exhibitions they rarely delivered solutions directly instead nuance relied on telecommunications partners such as nortel periphonics avaya and syntellect nuance realised that designing and developing speechbased solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional dtmf solutions for a couple of years prior to the takeover by scansoft nuance started selling products directly including their callrouting product call steering which determined the skill group required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller nuance  is the first release excluding service packs of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including philips speech pearl speechworks nuance recognizer and others further information is not known about this product partnership with the siri and apple incedit siri is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced naturallanguage processing the artificial intelligence which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload allows software to understand words and their intentions telephony application processedit user invokes the telephony application for call automation application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software user speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct recognizer processedit determines the start of speech input uses audio techniques to remove background noise slices the audio into small sections  to  ms in length determines the sound in each slice matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrasescitation needed topologyedit a typical nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started often monitored by a sixth application nlm nuance license manager kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use recclient recognition client it is the interface between the ivr speech path and the speech recognizing software the recserver the recclient can be developed into the ivr software resourcemanager distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide faulttolerance recserver where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary grammarcompiler an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition watchdog a windows service or unix daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes restarting them if required except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers the other processes may be spread over a farm of servers connected by an ip network with low latency and highbandwidth usually a dedicated lan segment the resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized acquisitionsedit prior to the  merger scansoft

for military and government agencies nuance merged with its competitor in the commercial largescale speech application business scansoft in october  scansoft was a xerox spinoff that was bought in  by visioneer a hardware and software scanner company which adopted scansoft as the new merged company name the original scansoft had its roots in kurzweil computer products a software company that

communications inc  nuance acquisitions after merger  references  external links company historyedit in september  scansoft inc acquired and merged with nuance communications and the resulting company adopted the nuance name for a decade prior to that the two companies competed in the commercial largescale speech application business scansoft originsedit in  raymond kurzweil founded the kurzweil computer products inc to develop the first omnifont optical characterrecognition system—a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font in  kurzweil sold his company to xerox the company became known as xerox imaging systems xis and later scansoft in march  a new company called visioneer inc was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products such as a sheetfed scanner called papermax and the document management software paperport visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to primax electronics ltd in january  two months later in march visioneer acquired scansoft from xerox to form a new public company with scansoft as the new companywide name prior to  scansoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as textbridge paperport and omnipage beginning with the december  acquisition of lernout  hauspie the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with nuance nuance history prior to the  merger with scansoftedit nuance was founded in  as a spinoff of sri internationals speech technology and research star laboratory to commercialize the speakerindependent speech recognition technology developed for the us government at sri based in menlo park california nuance deployed their first commercial largescale speech application in  their initial route to market was through call center automation call centers had just centralized the branchoffice telephone handling function throughout many large companies the highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff early projects were completely developed by nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits early nuance applications ran on windows ntbased and solaris operating systems and commonly relied on dialogic boards for the telephony hardware in  nuance was spun off from sris star lab two years later nuance deployed its first commercial speech application on  april  nuance filed an initial public offering ipo on the nasdaq under the symbol nuan on  november  nuance acquired speechfront voice instant messaging company for  million in cash and stock in simple terms the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases its key advantage over technologies such as viavoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker this permitted the use of the system socalled speakerindependent naturallanguage speech recognition abbreviated as sinlsr or just nlsr for call automationcitation needed the limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases in complex systems this could be in the low millions at the time these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity intel x servers until the early scitation needed during the late s and into the s nuance competed against other nlsr vendors including philips speechpearl speechworks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as vocalis in the uk which used proprietary pci cards with dsps on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system each speechrecognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself languages are modeled samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model the higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user especially in complex interactions different language models were required for different dialects such as flemish being a variant of dutch or swiss german being a dialect of high german different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection europes philips had by far the largest language coverage which included flemish and welsh later nuance sold licenses training and consulting to their technology to third parties including independent software vendors and interactive voice response ivr vendors who would build applications on top of an ivr platform speechworks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners the technology was integrated into most of the leading ivr products from avaya nortel periphonics envox syntellect and many others the requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of unix nuance  was launched in the late s and was an efficient networkdistributed nlsr speech recognition solution it ran on unix and windows nuance  added statistical language modeling an adaption of technologies used in technologies such as viavoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity nuance x series also introduced the wc vocabulary definition language grxml in addition to and eventual replacement of nuances proprietary and very concise grammar specification language gsl nuance  was the last point release before the takeover by scansoft these systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as viavoice which is now also a nuance productcitation needed while nuance marketed their technology at callcenter exhibitions they rarely delivered solutions directly instead nuance relied on telecommunications partners such as nortel periphonics avaya and syntellect nuance realised that designing and developing speechbased solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional dtmf solutions for a couple of years prior to the takeover by scansoft nuance started selling products directly including their callrouting product call steering which determined the skill group required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller nuance  is the first release excluding service packs of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including philips speech pearl speechworks nuance recognizer and others further information is not known about this product partnership with the siri and apple incedit siri is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced naturallanguage processing the artificial intelligence which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload allows software to understand words and their intentions telephony application processedit user invokes the telephony application for call automation application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software user speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct recognizer processedit determines the start of speech input uses audio techniques to remove background noise slices the audio into small sections  to  ms in length determines the sound in each slice matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrasescitation needed topologyedit a typical nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started often monitored by a sixth application nlm nuance license manager kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use recclient recognition client it is the interface between the ivr speech path and the speech recognizing software the recserver the recclient can be developed into the ivr software resourcemanager distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide faulttolerance recserver where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary grammarcompiler an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition watchdog a windows service or unix daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes restarting them if required except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers the other processes may be spread over a farm of servers connected by an ip network with low latency and highbandwidth usually a dedicated lan segment the resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized acquisitionsedit prior to the  merger scansoft
