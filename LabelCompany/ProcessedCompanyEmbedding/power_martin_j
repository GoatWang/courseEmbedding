pressure vessel committee corwritten by engineers with extensive experience with both major boiler manufacturers and on the asme boiler and pressure vessel committee this comprehensive guide explains the asme construction process covered by section i of the code unlike other guides that simply summarize rules it cites over  relevant asme interpretations that describe actual applications supplying insights into the thinking of the code subcommittee on power boilers these interpretations provide an extremely useful body of information which guides the user in many practical situations not explicitly covered by the rules of section i the construction of power boilers also requires the use of other sections of the code besides section i section ii for materials section v for nondestructive examination section ix for qualification of welders and weld procedures and b power piping for the design of much of the boiler piping this volume carefully explains the use of these other sections with helpful guidance on the avoidance of the many pitfalls awaiting the unwary designer it includes chapters on boiler life extension and repairs and on the alterations of boilers under the rules of the national board inspection code as well as useful appendices power boilers covers the new  edition of section i it provides expert advice and information for design engineers project managers architect engineers manufacturing engineers boiler operators insurance inspectors and other boiler professionals it can also serve as a quick reference because of its extensive table
