performance emotions on parade — hanson  doremus menu phone number your custom text here emotions on parade october   eric hanson barron’s reported recently that ray devoe had died ray was a long time market commentator i first ran into his material at spencer trask back in the ’s the devoe report was always thought provoking often amusing and a must read in a world so full of throw away commentaryray came up with what i still think is the best description of the stock market the market is “only indirectly related to economics it is a function of human fear greed and apprehension all overlaid on a business cycle” two sentences that’s all you needtoday fear and apprehension are moving front and center stocks have rallied for five years now and the us economy has been getting slowly better but the public is not a believer see chart below jobs are being created but not fast enough and incomes except for those at the very top are stagnant so when the world economy starts to look more dicey as it does now investors get a lot more emotional in emotional markets investors are prone to a number of behavioral missteps one is how they view gains versus losses there is pleasure in making a ten percent profit in a stock but the feeling of pain that comes from losing ten percent is even more intense than the pleasure of making ten percent now multiply this by  years of making gains  followed by the fear that you might give this back and you see where the nervousness in this market is coming from not terribly rational maybe but very humananother behavioral bias is anchoring we sometimes focus on a price or value at a moment in time to the exclusion of all others for instance right now we are focused on our portfolio’s high water mark earlier this summer and the fear that we are now moving down below that forget the fact that this is just one point in time we fail to recall how much progress we have made since the market bottom in  and that the investment race is not a sprint but a marathon and that up and down cycles are just part of the race we don’t know whether this is the greatest time to sell or just a short term hiccup in the market’s continued rise but we do know investors don’t spend a lot of time researching their investments see chart below they make a lot of snap decisions the market is always doing its best to force us into wrong decisions at the wrong times if you need cash for something within the next year then certainly raise it but don’t abandon  your long term strategy just because the market is getting more emotional people — hanson

gets flattened july   julie won in a june speech andrew haldane chief economist at the bank of england said that much is well with the uk  the economy has had  consecutive quarters of growth consumer and business confidence is solid and the jobs market is strong  employment is at its highest rate since  while unemployment is at its lowest since  but one thing that has been disappointing and puzzling is wage growth  in spite of good output and jobs numbers wages have risen little since the financial crisis – much as has been the case in other developed economies  the puzzle is if the jobs market is booming why aren’t wages risingas every firstlevel economics student learns we expect to see wages rise as unemployment falls  the traditional relationship depicted by the phillips curve  and yet in recent years this hasn’t happened  as shown in this chart from haldane’s speech the phillips curve has flattened my source “work wages and monetary policy” speech by andrew g haldane at national science and media museum bradford june  many have focused on slow productivity growth as the main cause – or they direct attention to big structural changes in labor markets due to technology and globalization  but haldane points out that there is more than that  there is also the changing nature of work in particular haldane is talking about lower union participation and the growing numbers of selfemployed flexible and parttime workers  call it the gig economy  call it the “casualization” of work  today jobs are different the evidence on how lower unionization erodes wages is pretty clear  unions historically have been associated with a wage premium of  –  in the uk because the collective bargaining power of the many is stronger than that of the individual   as union participation has declined so have the positive effects that collective bargaining power has on wageshaldane suggests there’s a like change with the rise of selfemployment and flexible work   as work has become less structured more informal and “more divisible at the level of the individual worker” more people are being paid by the task or hour than in the past  as a result wage negotiation has become less collective and more idiosyncratic  indeed there’s some evidence that selfemployment is associated with a wage discount of   a discount perhaps given in exchange for greater flexibility or control over one’s workwhat’s interesting is haldane’s suggestion that today’s gig economy resembles the nature of work before the industrial revolution  in the old artisanal days there usually weren’t any unions  most preindustrial workers were selfemployed got paid by the piece and had flexible hours  whether you were milking cows or sewing buttons work was task or piecebased  and while not too much should be read into this haldane points out that preindustrialization phillips curves were similar to today’s in his words “as flat as a pancake”   my source “work wages and monetary policy” speech by andrew g haldane at national science and media museum bradford june  note the minute thought will be on break next week and return on august    sign up to receive “the minute thought” weekly by email the minute thought america is number one china is the center of the universe july   julie won america is number one  china is center of universe  america is freedom  china is order  america is now  china is eternity these ideas come from harvard professor graham allison’s new book destined for war can america and china escape thucydides’s trap the main point of the book isn’t to elucidate the differences between china and the us  it is to explain why war between the us and china is more likely than most people think  even though neither country would want war or find it beneficial  but allison’s thesis is that when a rising power challenges a ruling power structural stresses can lead to war even when it’s neither party’s intent  that’s a situation that has arisen multiple times throughout history and today the us is the ruling power while china is the rising power to push the thesis forward the book does go into how very different the us and china are in culture and orientation since these differences can exacerbate rivalry  in a table called “america and china clash of cultures” allison reminds us that the way we see the world can be very different from the way others do   while allison says both the us and china have enormous superiority complexes – hence the “number one” and “center of universe” descriptors – the similarities end therechina treasures its  years of history – during most of which it saw itself as the world’s middle kingdom and preserver of order  the younger us in contrast takes pride in having built itself from scratch while promoting individual libertythe us believes in solving problems facing each issue anew and then moving on to the next one  china in contrast believes that it is only possible to “manage” certain problems and that solutions also give rise to other problems that can evolve over years decades or even centuriesamericans believe that the universal rights and freedoms they hold dear could benefit everyone around the world hence the “missionary” label in the table above  but the everpragmatic chinese do not worry about trying to convert others to their values and while the us often rationalizes its actions on the world stage in terms of “rules of law” or protections of freedoms the chinese have never felt the need to rationalize anything “chinese strategy” allison says “is unabashedly realpolitik” which allows china to be “ruthlessly flexible” in looking at allison’s table it’s hard not be struck by the idea that we don’t understand china as well as we should  what’s most remarkable is how longterm china’s perspective is  allison says “chinese seek victory not in a decisive battle but through incremental moves designed to gradually improve their position” and that patient accumulation of advantage is something worth carefully observing sign up to receive “the minute thought” weekly by email we’re talking the smiley face economy here… july   eric hanson president trump is intent on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the us he is convinced that “making things” is the holy grail to making america great againit is true manufacturing has declined as a percentage of the economy back  years ago a quarter of america’s production was manufacturing today it is  but america still makes a lot of things the value of america’s manufacturing is bigger than that of germany and japan combined we are manufacturing more and more today it’s just that we are doing it with fewer and fewer peoplestan shih the founder of acer a taiwanese maker of computer components and laptops once said that manufacturing is a little like the smiley face you make your money at both edges of the “smile curve” the left edge is where you design the product the right edge is where you brand and market the middle is where you actually manufacture but it is also where you make the least moneyapple is a good example the company’s profit margin is over  versus the average us manufacturer of  apple makes virtually none of its own products but it does the crucial things it designs the phones and laptops and then it creates the sizzle branding and marketing them superblymuch of apple’s manufacturing is done by the taiwanese company hon haifoxconn which employs a million people in china the chart below shows what happened when it moved into zhengzhou an inland city in china with lower wages than the main hon hai factories on the coast the zhengzhou facility has gone from zero employees in  to  today so hon hai must be making a ton of money right well actually hon hai’s profit margin is only  remember apple’s profit margin is over  the process of assembling apple phones in china accounts for only  of total iphone coststhe lesson here is that the big money in making things is not in making things but in the design and branding instead of worrying so much about bringing manufacturing jobs back we should be focusing on how to create a climate which will lead to the development of new products and new markets we should be focusing on education and on encouraging foreign talent to come here or stay here after college to develop their best ideascompanies that bring manufacturing jobs back will bring fewer jobs than the original factories employed the reason is robots and automation which are the way of the future apple has pledged to grow us manufacturing its first venture is with corning glass to make world beating gorilla glass even more innovative  but all these new jobs require advanced skills part of the smiley face economy is about manufacturing but not the manufacturing your grandfather would recognize     following up on odds and ends… july   eric hanson you might remember back in december we wrote about some common cuckoos who spend the spring and early summer in the wetlands near beijing china and then migrate south no one knew exactly where these cuckoos went so scientists fitted five birds with micro solar tags connected to satellites two of the birds were lost but three made it not only to india but an additional  nonstop miles to the east coast of africa so where are these birds today two of them made it all the way back from africa and are now happily feasting on caterpillars in the beijing wetlands  three of the original five didn’t make it or lost their responders  the survivors flappy and meng covered over  miles  remember these birds weigh all of  oz  quite a story of evolution and the diversity of our world speaking of evolution someone once said that life is all about chance and the laws of physics  the three tagged cuckoos who didn’t make it had their luck run out  humans like to say “there but for the grace of god go i” we humans never know when our luck is going to run out as recent random terrorist attacks around the world attest  the economist did a piece some years back about luck and the laws of physics and in this case the laws of geology in april  mount tambora a volcano on the indonesian island of sumbawa erupted  it was and still is the most powerful eruption of the past  years and as the chart above shows volcanoes have an effect for years on global climate and the global economy  in the case of tambora agriculture suffered famines ensued and climatewise some areas got incredible amounts of rain while other previously lush areas went bone dry    what is the point of all this first that we can’t do much about disasters either natural ones or even manmade ones the only good news about volcanos is we usually get advance notice before eruptions a second point is the best way to position ourselves for calamities is to be balanced  in our investments this means holding some real estate some stocks and some bonds we just don’t know what the future holds most all of us crave certainty but certainty is not something we can buy even at the highest prices so be careful what you pay for investments be a skeptic and a value investor stay as balanced as possible live within your means and yes be an optimist and hope for the best  this last part is probably good health advice  microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in
