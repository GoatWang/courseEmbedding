respondents consent to the entry of this order instituting proceedings making findings and imposing ceaseanddesist orders pursuant to section c of the securities exchange act of  order as set forth below iii on the basis of this order and the respondents offers the commission finds that a respondents and related party  respondents a anika is a massachusetts corporation with its headquarters in woburn massachusetts it manufactures and sells therapeutic products and devices intended to treat bone cartilage and soft tissue during all relevant times anikas common stock was traded on the nasdaq national market system and was registered with the commission pursuant to section g of the exchange act b engle age  resides in napa california he was the president and chief executive officer of anika from september  to june  engle also served as chairman of anika from february  to june  he is no longer employed by anika c moran age  resides in norfolk massachusetts he was employed as anikas chief financial officer from february  until january  in that capacity he was responsible for among other things performing financial and accounting functions relating to both public reporting and internal financial recording prior to that he served as controller of medchem products inc anikas former parent moran is a certified public accountant he is no longer employed by anika  related party in november  anika entered into a tenyear exclusive agreement with a distributor the distributor pursuant to which it received exclusive rights to distribute one of anikas products orthovisc to end customers in canada most of europe and the united states the agreement pursuant to the agreement which was filed with the commission as an exhibit to anikas form sba on november   the distributor made upfront payments to anika of  million was required to purchase at least  units of orthovisc annually and would make future payments of up to  million provided that orthovisc received certain regulatory approvals and met enumerated sales milestones milestone payments b facts  summary this matter involves anikas improper recognition of approximately  million in revenue from sales of its product orthovisc to the distributor in  and  j melville engle anikas ceo and sean moran anikas cfo caused anika to prematurely record on its books and records and report in periodic filings with the commission revenue from three billandhold transactions with the distributor at the time of invoicing and prior to actual shipment and delivery of the product to the distributor anika also failed to adequately disclose in its filings with the commission that approximately  million in billandhold sales to the distributor in  were expressly predicated on anikas agreement with the distributor under which the distributor would purchase  million in orthovisc in exchange for a  million reduction in previously disclosed future potential milestone payments from the distributor further in press releases issued in july and october  anika improperly characterized the billandhold sales of orthovisc to the distributor as international sales when in fact they were not being resold by the distributor internationally but were being held in storage by anika in march  and again in september  anika restated its financial statements for the affected periods as a result anika violated the periodic reporting books and records and internal accounting control provisions of sections a ba and bb of the exchange act and rules b a and a thereunder and engle and moran violated rule b of the exchange act and caused anikas violations of sections a ba and bb of the exchange act and rules b a and a thereunder  anika improperly recognized revenue from billandhold sales in  pursuant to the agreement the distributor placed orders with anika for a total of approximately  units of orthovisc in april and july  in early september  in light of the different labeling and packaging requirements for orthovisc in various regulatory jurisdictions anika recommended to the distributor that anika invoice for the approximately  unit order under anikas normal payment terms but that it hold the distributors order atanikas refrigerated facility under this arrangement the distributor would pay for the invoice within  days of invoicing and anika would hold the units as unlabeled unpackaged filled syringes until the distributor desired shipment on september   anika invoiced the distributor  for the  units ordered in april and july  the distributor paid for the units in november  within the  day payment period established by the parties under the agreement the  unit order was not shipped to the distributor until march  as per the distributors request anika however recorded revenue for this sale on its books and records for the quarter ended september   in its quarterly report for the quarter ended september   filed with the commission on form q anika recognized  from this billandhold sale as revenue for that quarter anika also recognized this revenue in its annual report for the year ended december   filed with the commission on form k moran made and engle approved the decision to recognize revenue from the transaction during the quarter ended september   engle and moran both signed the third quarter  form q and  form k a anikas accounting treatment of the  billandhold sale failed to comply with gaap as the commission stated in sunbeam corporation exchange act rel no  accounting and auditing enforcement rel no  may    sec lexis  bill and hold sales are unusual transactions subject to stringent accounting criteria the commission has previously articulated these criteria in stewart parness exchange act rel no  accounting and auditing enforcement rel no  august    sec lexis  anikas september  billandhold transaction with the distributor did not satisfy all of the parness criteria as a result the transaction failed to comply with gaap and should not have been recorded or recognized as revenue in the quarter ended september   anikas transaction with the distributor failed to meet the following criteria necessary for revenue recognition the risks of ownership had not yet passed to the buyer although the distributor took title to the inventory at the time of invoicing and had no right of return except for defective product the full risk of ownership had not yet passed to the buyer because anika agreed that it would bear responsibility for any loss of product during packaging a process that the distributor inventory had yet to undergo at the time of the revenue recognition anika and the distributor had not agreed to a fixed schedule for delivery of the goods anika retained specific performance obligations such that the earnings process was not complete the labeling packaging and sterilization process that the orthovisc still needed to undergo consisted of approximately  of the total manufacturing cost of the product anika failed to properly segregate the distributors orthovisc units from other stored units of orthovisc tubs labeled with the distributors name holding the distributors  units were not consolidated but rather were located throughout anikas refrigerated storage facility and commingled with other tubs in addition the orthovisc units that made up the transaction were not used to fill that particular order but rather were either shipped to another anika customer or were used to fill other separate orders from the distributor and the product was not complete and ready for shipment at the time anika recognized the revenue anika had not yet labeled packaged and sterilized the product in its packaging another parness factor weighing against anikas recognition of the revenue from this transaction was under the agreement that anika bore the risk of loss in the event of a decline in the market value of the goods under the agreement anika was required to refund money to the distributor if the parties estimated selling price to end customers was higher than the actual selling price anika was ultimately required to refund the distributor nearly  for the sales initially recorded in  b anika deviated from its written revenue recognition policy when it recognized revenue from the above billandhold transaction in the third quarter of  anika contradicted the revenue recognition policy set forth in both its  and  forms k in the  form k the policy stated in relevant part that the company recognizes revenue on product sales when the products are shipped and the customer takes ownership in the  form k the policy stated in relevant part product revenue is recognized upon shipment of commercial product and represents sales of products hyvisc and orthovisc anika did not ship the product from the third quarter of  billandholdtransaction to the distributors facility until march  almost six months after it had recognized revenue from the sale nonetheless the company neither qualified the revenue recognition policy in its  form k nor included information in its commission filings about its deviation from its stated revenue recognition policy both engle and moran were aware of the written revenue recognition policy at the time of anikas recognition of revenue from the billandhold transaction  anika improperly recognized revenue from billandhold sales in  due to delays in launching orthovisc in europe in  the distributor was in early  still storing approximately  of the  units of orthovisc it had already purchased from anika despite this level of inventory in late april  the distributor proposed to engle that it buy  additional units of orthovisc from anika in the second and third quarters of  or approximately  million in inventory in exchange for a  million reduction in potential future milestone payments by the distributor to anika the additional units were above and beyond the contractually required annual minimum purchase of  units engle after consulting with moran and other anika officials agreed to this proposal the additional units ordered were divided into two invoices one on june   which the distributor paid in august  and the other on september   which the distributor paid in november  in a may   letter the distributor requested that the  additional units be treated as billandhold transactions in its quarterly report for the period ended june   filed with the commission on form q anika prematurely recognized  from the june   billandhold transaction of  units as revenue for that quarter in its quarterly report for the period ended september   filed with the commission on form q anika prematurely recognized  from the september   billandhold transaction of  units as revenue for that quarter anika also recorded revenue from those transactions on its books and records for the quarters ended june   and september   once again moran made and engle approved the decision to recognize the revenue from the billandhold transactions before the product was shipped to the distributor both engle and moran signed the second and third quarter  forms q like the third quarter of  billandhold transaction these  billandhold transactions did not satisfy all of the parness criteria and therefore failed to comply with gaap as with the prior transaction the risk of loss for the product had not yet passed to the customer in addition anika and the distributor had not agreed to a fixed schedule for delivery of the goods to the distributor indeed few of the units ordered were ever delivered to the distributor of the approximately  units that the distributor purchased from anika in  only about  were ever shipped to the distributor further anika had not completed the earnings process for these units the remaining manufacturing process constituted approximately  of the total cost of the product anika also failed to properly segregate the inventory finally as with the  transaction the product sold on a billandhold basis in  was not complete and ready for shipment at the time of revenue recognition because anika had not yet labeled packaged and sterilized it in its packaging by recognizing revenue from the june  billandhold transaction in the second quarter of  anika again contradicted the revenue recognition policy set forth in its  form k the company again failed to include any information in its commission filing in the second quarter of  about its deviation from this stated revenue recognition policy  anika failed to adequately disclose its arrangementwith the distributor for additional  sales in various filings with the commission through at least  anika had disclosed that under the agreement with the distributor anika has the potential to receive additional payments aggregating up to  million upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and enumerated sales milestones as explained above in early  anika and the distributor entered into an arrangement pursuant to which the distributor would purchase  million in orthovisc above the minimum amount stipulated in the agreement in  and in exchange anika would provide a  million reduction in potential future milestone payments from the distributor to anika in its form q for the second quarter of  anika disclosed that the amount of the milestone payments it could potentially receive from the distributor was reduced to  million nevertheless anika failed to adequately disclose in any of its filings with the commission or in its press releases announcing financial results that the  million in additional sales to the distributor in the second and third quarters of  resulted from giving up the rights to  million in potential revenues in the form of future milestone payments both engle and moran were aware that this was a key component of the distributors agreement to purchase additional orthovisc during  the  bill and hold sale of an additional  units of orthovisc to the distributor in exchange for giving up a future milestone payment was also material to anikas financial results the sale of  units recognized in the second quarter of  totaled  or approximately  of anikas reported quarterly revenues the sale of the  units recognized in the third quarter of  totaled  or approximately  of anikas reported quarterly revenues  anika inaccurately stated that the  billandhold transactions were international sales in anikas announcement of its second and third quarter  financial results in press releases dated july   and october   the company characterized orthovisc sales to the distributor in those quarters as international sales anika characterized these sales as international despite knowing that the distributors sales of orthovisc in the international market were poor and that most of the units of orthovisc that anika sold to the distributor during this time were being held in storage at anikas facilities few of the units were ever sold in the international market  anikas restatements on march   and september   on march   anika restated its earnings figures for  and the first three quarters of  in its  form k specifically anika restated results by reducing revenues from  the  billandhold transaction anika entered into with the distributor during the third quarter of  the  billandhold transaction in the second quarter of  and the  billandhold transaction in the third quarter of  and  its recognition of the full per unit sale price of orthovisc to the distributor without taking into account the possibility of anika having to refund some of the sales price to the distributor the restatement indicated that anika would recognize revenue for sales of orthovisc at the time of shipment to the distributor and based on the minimum per unit price under the agreement according to the restatement anika overstated revenues for the three quarters in which it recognized revenue from the billandhold transactions by  or  third quarter of   or  second quarter of  and  or  third quarter of  over  of the overstated revenues in those quarters were attributable to the billandhold transactions anika also overstated net income for those quarters by  or  third quarter of   or  second quarter of  and  which resulted in a change from net income of  to a net loss of  third quarter of  because the first restatement improperly accounted for the september  billandhold transaction anika had to restate its earnings from that transaction for a second time on september   in its  form k which contained the first restatement and was signed by engle anika clarified its revenue recognition policy with respect to sales to the distributor as follows anika had also recognized revenue in  and the first three quarters of  for orthovisc which was held in its refrigerators at the distributors request under the companysrevised revenue recognition policy this revenue will be recorded when the orthovisc is shipped to the distributor however the restatement improperly moved the revenue from the third quarter of  billandhold transaction into the fourth quarter of  in fact under gaap and pursuant to anikas clarified revenue recognition policy described in the first restatement revenue from that billandhold transaction should have been recognized in the first quarter of  when the product was actually shipped and delivered to the distributor thus anikas annual report for the period ended december   filed with the commission on form k contained inaccuracies concerning anikas revenue for  and  c legal analysis  anika violated section a of the exchange act and

december   and december   and its forms q for the quarters ended september   july   andseptember   materially overstated the companys revenues anika also failed to adequately disclose in its mda or

revenues and inaccurately stated that certain sales of orthovisc to the distributor in  were international sales accordingly the annual and quarterly reports discussed above were inaccurate and anika

the third quarter of  and the second and third quarters of  on anikas books and records and in anikas periodic commission filings engle also approved anikas subsequent improper recognition of revenue from the september  billandhold transaction in its march  restatement and in its books and records recording and recognizing revenue from those transactions did not comply with gaap and with respect

other than respondents anika engle and moran  orthovisc is a treatment for osteoarthritis that is manufactured in a liquid form and placed into syringes for injection into the knee the product must be refrigerated during and after the manufacturing process  generally a billandhold transaction is a practice whereby a customer agrees to purchase goods and the seller invoices the customer but the seller retains physical possession until a later delivery date there are very limited circumstances under generally accepted accounting principles gaap that permit a seller to recognize revenue from a billandhold transaction prior to shipping the goods as discussed in section a and anika did not satisfy all of the necessary criteria for revenue recognition for its billandhold transactions  the distributor began selling orthovisc in canada in february  and in parts of western europe in february  orthovisc has yet to receive food and drug administration approval for sale in the united states as a result the distributor never sold orthovisc in the united states in november  the distributor terminated the agreement  in addition this  revenue figure for the billandhold transaction in the third quarter of  inappropriately assumed a purchase price of  per unit of orthovisc which did not reflect the possibility that anika might have had to refund a portion of the purchase price if the actual selling price to end customers was lower than expected the agreement called for the distributor to pay anika  of orthoviscs estimated selling price to end customers anika and the distributor agreed that the initial estimated selling price to end customers would be  per unit which required the distributor to pay anika  per unit in  the agreement also stated that the minimum per unit price that the distributor would pay anika was  or if both parties agreed as low as  per unit if the distributor sold orthovisc to end customers at a price lower than the parties estimated selling price anika was required to refund the difference to the distributor at the end of the year indeed anika was later required to refund nearly  to the distributor based on a purchase price of  per unit  see statement of financial accounting concepts no  paragraphs  and   the distributors sales to end customers in  and  were extremely low of the approximately  units of orthovisc it purchased from anika during this period the distributor sold only approximately  units to end customers the remaining units were destroyed and anika retained the purchase price paid by the distributor for such units  moran left anika in early  to take other employment and was not involved in the two restatements  along with the restatement anika changed its method for recognizing nonrefundable upfront payments to conform with the guidance issued in december  in sec staff accounting bulletin  anika had previously recognized  million in such payments upon receipt when the company filed its restated numbers in its  form k anika began recording the revenue on a prorata basis over the life of the agreement and recorded a  million charge in the first quarter of  to reflect the cumulative effect of the change  the revenue that was restated was subsequently recognized as revenue by anika after the distributor terminated the agreement  regulation sk also provides that the discussion of material changes in
