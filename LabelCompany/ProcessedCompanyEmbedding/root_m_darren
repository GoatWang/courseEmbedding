login login building a  figure firm the darren root interview posted  pm by jetpack workflow  filed under growing your firm podcast this week we’re excited to release our latest interview with darren root ceo of rootworks president of root  associates and author of the popular titles “emyth for accountants” “intentional accountant” and “youtility for accountants” in this episode we talked about how darren was able to sell off  of his clients from his accounting firm and build his dream practice the critical characteristics of a nextgeneration accounting firm r his approach to building businesses that run independent of him and much more click below to listen key summary points roughly  of cpa firm owners spend their days working on todo list items that are urgent yet not important things like answering emails jumping on calls diving into details about which engagement letter was sent to what client a vast majority of their time is spent doing the wrong things does this sound familiar to you in today’s podcast we jump into the ongoing discussion of how accounting firm owners can stop doing work they hate and finally start building their business around the life they want to live this is darren root’s mission for building a next generation accounting firm and the topic we dive deep into to provide a valuable insight on how to help you build and grow your firm let’s start at the beginningdarren root’s background darren root spent a majority of his childhood watching learning and working alongside his father as a practicing accountant it was during this time darren began to develop his understanding of how cpa firms should be run the old fashioned way after graduating college at indiana university darren went to work for deloitte in the tax department focused on usbased tax returns in a few short years at deloitte darren’s entrepreneurial spirit was reignited and he left deloitte to open up his own accounting firm launch of root  associates during the first year of opening shop in indiana darren described the process as a bit slow he had to put all of the pieces together one by one and begin announcing himself as a professional tax partner “here is my recommendation for businesses that first start out give yourself at least a year before things really start kicking in”  darren root just like he recommended after roughly  year of opening his doors in bloomingdale darren started growing his book of business very quickly at the time it was just him and one other staff member but as the firm grew he hired additional help within  years of opening his business root  associates grew from  in revenue to roughly m of revenue and darren root had yet to turn  years old the growth of root  associates darren contributes his growth of m in book of business in just  years to  different key factors  location was great darren was opening his shop in the town he went to college in this is the same town that hosted  students and provided opportunities for people to open up small businesses and be successful  he knew the movers  shakers in the town during college darren worked at mens clothing store where he became acquainted with all of the “movers  shakers” of the town this simple one on one interaction allowed darren the opportunity to build a network of potential clients fairly quickly  he gravitated towards technology darren opened up his firm roughly  years ago and at the time technology was just starting to show it’s face among the accounting industry though he always worked in an oldfashioned accounting firm watching his father darren knew technology was going to play a big role in his firm so he welcomed the changes of technology in his new business so building a  figure firm in just under  years sounds like pure blissright not exactly struggling to stay afloat as previously stated darren did know how to run an accounting practice the old way  by watching his father crank out hour workweeks and be smothered with client deadlines within  years of launching his firm he saw himself repeating his father’s past darren was working himself to death plus he had a wife and three young children at home so the responsibilities were tacked on to the client work and office drama “i thought to myself wow i’ve grown this firm but my life sucks”  darren root the path to a new life it took a long time for darren to realize change needed to happen he struggled to maintain his large book of business and continued on the struggle train for  more years the pain continued to grow and grow and grow until he finally decided something needed to change around this same time darren walked into a bookstore remember this was preaudiobooks and ran across the first book that would change his life emyth by michael gerber at the time darren called himself a technician he was a technican at deloitte turning out tax returns then he grew his own accounting firm still recognizing himself as just a technician not a business owner “after reading the emyth i began to realize all i had done was create a technical job for myself and i’m not actually running a company what i really wanted to do was to be an entrepreneur and run a company and that was not happening”  darren root right around the same time darren was having his first epiphany he revisited his bookshelf and reread a book he thought was geared towards running a business  habits of highly effective people by stephen covey after darren reread covey’s book he began to realize that the book had nothing to do with business but everything to do with being empowered to take control of your life the way you want to live it darren quickly started to see how he could implement various practices into his life that was trickle down into how he ran his firm if he put important things first it could turn him from being in a reactive position to a more proactive less stressed business owner  years into his life of running root  associates darren decided to make a change and a big one at that leaving the practice he built to start over darren knew that in order to create the life he wanted to live he needed to start over with a blank slate this time taking all of his previous knowledge skills and expertise coupled with this new found idea of creating a different kind of business he left his firm to start over “i woke up one morning after having these ideas from the books rolling around in my head and thought to myself i need to go create a business that will support the life that i want to live”  darren root darren decided to give  of his client base to another partner and cherry picked the clients he actually wanted to work with roughly  worth of business root  associates the first ‘next generation accounting firm’ so there he was at  years old creating a brand new accounting firm again but this time darren took his best clients with him on his new venture and told them he was going to do things differently the goal build a business to support the life he wanted with this new goal in mind darren set out to apply the ‘e myth’  ‘ habits of highly effective people’ concepts to the mission of root  associates he wanted to create the beginning of his business with the end goals in mind in order to implement his goals darren root knew he needed to create a company that could be leveraged by other people “what i wanted was a business that did not depend solely on me i wanted to create a company that could be leveraged by other people‘ ‘so i had to do the kind of services that allowed me to leverage them as a team instead of building a set of services geared around my skillset which is what most practitioners do”  darren root shrink the services offerings  an increase in profits originally darren’s old firm offered roughly  different services any time a client asked for something the firm said “sure we can do that” this mindset had to go darren had a skillset in us tax so he wanted to limit the amount of services to offer and train his staff to be experts in those core areas from  services darren knocked down their offerings to just  services a few of them included bookkeeping for service based businesses payroll client accounting for service based businesses not manufacturing etc usbased residence tax work darren believes the key is to understand the product that you are going to deliver then create a system around the product being offered and train your people to learn how to implement and deliver this product the outcome provides a great consistency throughout the firm and less and less stress as he is no longer trying to offer auditing services as a tax professional success at root  associates darren thought that if he knew how to do excellent service for one particular client he could go out and find similar clients that fit his niche expertise this would lead to staff not having to learn different services all the time and finally allow darren to create a company that he could manage “lets create a company that does not depend on you that you can create a product and be really good at delivering and then find people to do just that”  darren root darren goes on to mention that accounting firms run into this problem all the time they want to create a business around whats comfortable  natural for the owners they have a skillset go out and create a bunch of clients around their particular skillset then have to be the one doing all the work and wake up to realize they are extremely stressed and unhappy this is where rootworkscom come into play the beginning of rootworks after darren made the transition he went from m with  people at his old firm to root  associates now which has m in book of business with just  people darren has no direct client responsibilities and gets to manage his business the way he wants darren began helping software vendors in the accounting space try and grow their company he started teaching the ceos of these software companies to stop trying to sell to accountants instead educate accounting professionals how to make their lives better with this software and this will in turn make the partners want to buy the software these same software companies decided to fund darren to create a new platform to tell his story and found it was incredibly successful “during this process i found that firms were starved for this kind of information there were so many firms in his old position looking for a better life i saw that there was company here and created rootworks” within  months of starting root works darren was asked to be the executive editor of cpa practice advisor he realized the impact of marketing by having his picture on the first page of the magazine being sent to  cpa firm owners all of a sudden rootworks hit the perfect storm “we started this new company and got the chance to showcase the company through cpa practice advisor and quickly became a household name”  darren root what is rootworks essentially rootworks offers entrepreneurial strategy coaching and products to help you transform your practice into a next generation accounting firm® so of course your next question is what is a next generation accounting firm inside rootworkscom darren and his team outlines the vision of a ngaf “at the very pinnacle of the model is the definition of a next generation accounting firm ‘a business built on focused intention with unmitigated entrepreneurial spirit that enables you to have the life you want’ ‘it runs on a business model that supports an environment where you can be present in all aspects of your personal and professional lives to have the greatest impact on family staff clients and community’ ‘a business that operates independent of you creates a better working culture for your firm offers security through recurring revenue fosters creative thinking evokes excitement with each new stage of evolution inspires the next generation of professionals and is built for transition to support your legacy”  rootworkscom at rootworks darren and his team preaches the stance of defining the future that cpa and accounting firm owners actually want they hone in on  different questions to ask yourself who do you want to serve what do you want to service how do you want to deliver this service to learn more about how to model your firm after

a comment below to enter the chance to win darren’s latest book jim davis late to the post but i don’t see where a winner was selected do i win by default as a finder fee david hey jim we’ve already awarded the book but shoot me an email at david at jetpackworkflowcom and i’ll send over a few resources the bearded cpa our goal is to tighten our client facing systems and create real value for our clients david thanks for the comment one of the best workflow ‘tactics’ is to think about how the client experiences the workflow not just the team great comment judy coker i’m a sole practitioner start up leaving an established book of business built over  years to remake how i do business the old way of  hour work weeks with no family time and watching the people in the office grow grayer instead of bringing in new talent made me realize that it was time to change the status quo my goal by the end of  is to be a paperless and mostly virtual office with at least one other professional in the office who is dedicated to building a career not just a job david thanks for the comment judy seems very aligned with darren’s story will you have any clients coming over from the previous book of business or is it  from scratch if interested i can share a few interviews related to new client acquisition and blog posts as well judy coker  from scratch back to the beginning from  to zero appreciate any suggestions or resources never stop learning david hi judy the best place that collects all our marketing articles is  httpsjetpackworkflowcomcategorymarketingforaccountants enjoy phillyfreedom my firm has been just me…stagnating for over  years i’d pick up a good client somehow and marketing would stop because i would be swamped with that new client i couldn’t imagine being able to handle anything more instead of hiring and training staff to get me out of working that client i kept at it solo until the client was gone then i would struggle until another good client came along this cycle repeated itself for the life of my firm i was the technician the marketing staff the firm administrator and managing partner i was wearing more hats than a baseball team i have hired  parttimers and am struggling with them for now they want to be fulltimers my goal is to create the systems in my firm to hold myself and now them accountable to getting things done…and then use those systems to grow the firm to enable them to be fulltimers david thank you for the comment the transition from practitioner to manager to owner is a difficult one i agree that process is important both for getting new clients as well as fulfilling the work thanks for the comment douglas mcdougal my goal is to move away from the technician role to a manager role and i know i need to bring in people to work for me i’ve often dreamed of scrapping the current practice as darren did in order to start over the way i want it to be i need to go back and read the emyth accountant again that has been my story david thank you for the comment douglas what do you think is the biggest barrier to growth predictable new client acquisition or better cashflow or systems or recruiting douglas mcdougal i think the answer is systems and new client acquisition the systems are getting better in that i have cut the number of hours i was working during busy season from about  per week seriously i almost didn’t survive that year to about  last season with the same number of clients however it’s still just me so i need to develop systems and bring people in to work them i view it like mcdonald’s a big mac is built the same way in each store i need to slow down develop the system and then apply it david sounds like the system has improved dramatically in order to decrease the hours but not total volume what’s the roadblock to your first hire cashflow or new business how to hire seasonal or well qualified people douglas mcdougal probably procrastination 🙂 cashflow is a bit of an issue but not a big one i think that i want to have someone come in and do more than just prep some returns during busy season the smart thing would be to bring someone in to do the work while i bring them in i’ve found that my close rate is ridiculous basically the only new client i don’t get is one that i don’t want i’m working on the procrastination issues as well as establishing huge goals for  this week aiming for about  new clients a huge growth but doable and will force me into hiring david 🙂 sounds like you need to hire asap i just read the hiring chapter out of the book double double from the previous coo of gotjunk help grow it from mm had a lot of great interview templates as well as a great approach to hiring if you’re going to experience that amount of growth i might look at hiring before the growth then as hiring takes  months then weeks to onboard also for the book i mentioned you can google the book or here’s the amazon link httpwwwamazoncomdoubleyourrevenueprofityearsdp pingback how to build a successful accounting firm website pingback how to become an advisor to your clients  not just a “papercruncher”  jetpack workflow gina brooks you probably already gave away the book but my goal is to find a clone of myself i did it about  years ago and she is holding her own working on our largest client she also need to hire a couple of clones in the next year or so i’m doing too much actual working in the company and not having the time to manage and grow the business my largest client brings in almost  of my revenue i want this to decrease to more like  not by decreasing what i do for this client he is actually growing and will double in the next year and a half or so i want to bring in the smaller clients to be more like  of my business this will require a large growth spurt and bringing in new employees finding really good employees is a struggle the other struggle is knowing how much to grow the business be hiring new employees david hi gina thanks for the note i believe planning out new hires to be extremely challenging and one of the leading indicating is dependent on how sure you are of your pipeline of new clients for marketing check out page  and  of our archives here httpsjetpackworkflowcomcategorymarketingforaccountantspage  for hiring i was a fan of chris regains interview and stephen king’s here
