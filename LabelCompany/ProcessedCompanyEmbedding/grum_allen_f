ordnance department was finally realized in 9 when the senate approved his branch transfer his first assignment was to savanna proving ground il the proving ground was a test area for mm and mm howitzers grums wartime service and careful ordnance training allowed him to be a contributing officer to the repair and storage of equipment returning from overseas he received his first ordnance command in  as the commanding officer of the th ordnance company at fort bragg nc grums wartime service and his considerable ordnance training enabled him to pass on his experiences and lessons learned to his junior officers and enlisted soldiers in 9 grum left fort bragg to join the ordnance department specialist school at raritan arsenal nj he departed raritan in 9 to become the assistant to the ordnance officer viii corps area in san antonio tx his position required him to travel extensively throughout the southwest united states visiting active reserve and national guard units he was next assigned to the militia bureau in 9 his two year experience in the corps area made him a valuable member of the ordnance department technical committee one who could provide accurate information

was medically retired from the army on  december  grums ordnance career was at a time between two wars it was at a time when the ordnance department officer corps was small at times less than  officers his return to rock island following his hospitalization and his determination to remain on active duty are solid examples of dedication that served to inspire those that knew him in many
