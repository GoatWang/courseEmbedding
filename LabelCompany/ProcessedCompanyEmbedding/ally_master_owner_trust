of the receivables were aged  to  days and only  of the receivables were aged over  days the receivables are geographically diverse with strength of dealer network based on a review of dealer financial metrics and allys internal dealer credit classifications the financial health of allys dealer network is viewed as stable with the majority of dealers profitable through q  historically high vehicle sales and the strength of the used vehicle market over the past five years have had positive effects on dealer financial health stable performance amot is experiencing consistent performance trends including stable monthly payment rates mprs asset yield low agings and minimal dealer defaults and trust losses with vehicle sales plateauing and inventory levels expected to rise heading into  fitch expects trust performance metrics to normalize in the next couple of years but remain healthy sufficient credit enhancement each series of notes benefits from subordination and a reserve account

concentration limits mitigating the risk of individual dealer defaults and losses exposure to individual vehicle types manufacturers and segments are mitigated with concentration limits in place

structure of the transaction provides that a bankruptcy of ally would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities to conduct a rating sensitivity for the outstanding notes under a category b dfp platform fitch assumes portfolio default levels at   and  and under two recoverylevel scenarios of  and  fitch modeled each series with the assumption that the above defaults have occurred reflecting asset performance in a stressed environment however to date performance for the trust has remained strong a material deterioration would have to occur in performance

the trust receivables are floorplan financing lines to financially stable and strong dealers for primarily new vehicles   of the receivables were aged  to  days and only  of the receivables were aged over  days the receivables are geographically diverse with strength of dealer network based on a review of dealer financial metrics and allys internal dealer credit classifications the financial health of allys dealer network is viewed as stable with the majority of dealers profitable through q  historically high vehicle sales and the strength of the used vehicle market over the past five years have had positive effects on dealer financial health stable performance amot is experiencing consistent performance trends including stable monthly payment rates mprs asset yield low agings and minimal dealer defaults and trust losses with vehicle sales plateauing and inventory levels expected to rise heading into  fitch expects trust performance metrics to normalize in the next couple of years but remain healthy sufficient credit enhancement each series of notes benefits from subordination and a reserve account structural features such as early amortization triggers mitigate risks of underperformance and exposure to dealermanufacturer defaults asset concentrations receivables in the trust are subject to concentration limits mitigating the risk of individual dealer defaults and losses exposure to individual vehicle types manufacturers and segments are mitigated with concentration limits in place consistent origination and servicing ally demonstrates adequate abilities as originator and servicer as evidenced by the historical delinquency and loss performance of amot legal analysis the legal structure of the transaction provides that a bankruptcy of ally would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities to conduct a rating sensitivity for the outstanding notes under a category b dfp platform fitch assumes portfolio default levels at   and  and under two recoverylevel scenarios of  and  fitch modeled each series with the assumption that the above defaults have occurred reflecting asset performance in a stressed environment however to date performance for the trust has remained strong a material deterioration would have to occur in performance to have potential negative impact on the ratings for each series
