developments in law public policy and psychological research from the library journal february epstein former editor in chief of psychology today has revised his respected  title the case against adolescence he claims that adolescent psychology is a myth created by a culture that overextends childhood and infantilizes teens that this myth makes young people feel angry and hopeless and that our current concept of adolescence is an unnecessary historical anomaly brought about by modern industrialization epstein recommends judging teens as individuals not as a group and for making decisions based on competencies not age each chapter leads with a concise overview which might provide enough information for busy readers and one of two new appendixes contains parenting tips for finding the

in every teenquill driver books april  from the publisher a revolutionary proposal for raising responsible and happy teenagers this groundbreaking book argues that adolescence is an unnecessary period of life that we’re better off without epstein shows that teen turmoil is caused by outmoded systems put in place a century ago which destroyed the continuum between childhood and adulthood where this continuum still exists in other countries there is no adolescence isolated from adults american teens learn everything they know from their mediadominated peers—“the last people on earth they should be learning from” says epstein he shows that our teens are highly capable—in some ways more capable than adults—and argues strongly against “infantilizing” young people we must rediscover “the adult in every teen” he says by giving young people adult authority and responsibility as soon as they can demonstrate readiness this landmark book will change our thinking about teens for decades to come

has opened my eyes…” mihaly csikszentmihalyi “a very original approach sure to ignite discussion and controversy” drew pinsky “a landmark book” suzanne somers “dr epstein makes a good case for adolescents to be treated not as a group with a formula but as individual unique people” jean liedloff “a powerful case” ellen langer “his arguments deserve serious consideration and open debate” john taylor gatto “whether you’re a parent a teacher a policy maker or a recovering victim of enforced childishness you need to read this book” curtis sliwa “…an amazing book long overdue”   parsing the
