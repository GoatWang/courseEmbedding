libraries worldwide this textbook for instruction in biomedical research ethics can also serve as a valuable reference for medical professionals and bioethicists the  cases included in the book are grouped in nine chapters each of which covers a key area of debate in the field some of the case studies are classics including the famous cases of the tuskegee syphilis study in which subjects with syphilis were not given treatment and the willowbrook hepatitis studies in which institutionalized subjects were intentionally exposed to hepatitis others focus on such current issues as human embryonic stem cell research cloning by somatic nuclear transfer and the design and function of institutional review boards each chapter begins with a brief introduction that places the issues raised in context this is followed by a number of cases each of which is no more than a few pages study questions meant to encourage further discussion follow each case after an introductory discussion of the history and tenets of ethics in medical research the books chapters cover oversight and study design informed consent the selection of subjects conflicts of interest the social effects of research embryos fetuses and children genetic research the use of animals and authorship and publication following these chapters are appendixes with the texts of the nuremburg code and the declaration of helsinki two key documents in the establishment of bioethical standards for research also included are a glossary a table of cases by general category and an alphabetical listing of cases book jacketjacket gay science  the ethics of sexual orientation research by timothy f murphy book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide gay science is the first comprehensive examination of the ethical questions surrounding sexual orientation research bioethicist timothy murphy presents the views of many gay men and women who detect ominous motives behind this research if a genetic marker were discovered for homosexual tendencies would genetic screening be used to further discriminate against gay people if a method for changing sexual orientation were developed would it be forced upon gay adults or children whose parents suspected they might grow up to be gay given the potential for its misuse is sexual orientation research fundamentally unethical murphy acknowledges that much of sexual orientation research to date has been bad science questionable in its motives and methodologically unsound he examines the social and historical conditions from the s to the present that spawned this research and reviews the findings that have often perpetuated confusion about homosexuality he assesses five major studies on sexual orientation undertaken in the s from neuroanatomist simon levays study of certain brain structures in gay men to the work of psychologist joseph nicolosi he questions the flawed and simplistic assumptions about sexuality made by much of this research murphy argues that a true science of sexual orientation would not be focused exclusively upon homosexuality nor presuppose its pathology
