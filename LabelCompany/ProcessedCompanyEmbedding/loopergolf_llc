questions — looper frequently asked questions  why would a facility want loopers pga professionals are in the business of saying “yes” to their memberscustomers looper exists to help you say “yes” to a very specific request from your memberscustomers with a minimum of labor and investment on your part  how do you recruit the caddiesloopers we recruit our jrloopers from the community local golf clubs high school golf teams and county golf organizations  including the first tee readygolfacademy loudon junior golf association and the pga junior league we recruit caddies based on their attitude and knowledge of the game and then expose them to the art and skills of caddyinglooping we only certify caddies who share our core values of service reliability and courtesy  what is the training process and quality control as all caddies are independent contractors we cannot train them rather we ensure they do everything they can to learn the game and trade on their own time there are three phases to our caddie recruitment process with both online and on site requirements followed by pga professional staff at each course getting the final approval on all caddies online material videos and document study followed by online test we hold local caddie orientation sessions each week for our new certified caddies orientation includes detailed sessions on the looper app what courses and customers expect from their caddies and looper core values the club’s pga professionals are invited to join in the final phase of the recruitment and certification process to ensure that their club’s standards are upheld and to help the caddies deliver an outstanding experience unique to each club  how are the caddiesloopers paid loopers are independent contractors and each sets up hisher own bank account and is paid through electronic transfer when each loop is finished via the mobile app payment processing tips if earned are paid in cash in person following the end of the loop  what responsibilities do looperfriendly clubs have we want you to set the standards and specific rules for your club one example is choosing the times and location for the caddies to meet their golfers as well as any special requirements for uniforms or customer interaction courses can also work with looper to highlight food and beverage specials merchandise sales or anything the club would like a golfer to be made aware of during hisher round with a looper  can we expect a loss in cart revenue certainly a small number of riders may walk when presented with the option of a caddie on the other hand members spend more and stay longer at clubs where their wants and needs are fulfilled with so many recreational choices fighting for your members’ time we are a solution to empower the pga professional to say “yes” to the request for caddies  what if a looper doesn’t show up we understand the importance of reliability and service and only hire caddies who share our commitment rarely there may be a situation when a caddie has an emergency that cannot be avoided in these cases we will do our best to locate a substitute caddie  what if a golfer wants to cancel at the last minute they will incur a cancellation fee for cancellations inside of  hours that fee can be applied  to their next round with loooper  how far in advance will our golfers need to request a looper we ask for at least  hours advance notice in the first year as supply of caddies increases we expect we can shorten the notice period needed to book a caddie to day of  what about looper for charity or corporate golf outings starting in june  looper will be able to field up to  caddies for a weekday corporate or charity outing in addition to providing outstanding service and speeding up the round looper
