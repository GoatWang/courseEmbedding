nearsurface gold targets at both rama creek and liwa creek the highgrade liwa creek prospect is located  km to the southeast of the rama coppergold porphyry which is surrounded by an area that has high potential for goldnow that the onset of dryer weather has allowed better access to the rama and liwa areas we can undertake a more meaningful field program in order to delineate drill targets for

sediment sampling program at rama creek was recently completed with  samples being collected over an area of  square kilometres heavy rain and associated flash flooding forced a temporary abandonment of field operations and the first batch of sample results are now expected from the laboratory before the end of the month fortyseven samples have been received by the lab for cyanide leach followed by gold silver and copper analysis and of these  will be going directly for multielement analysis analytical work on the remaining  samples will be governed by the results from the first batch

properties are the highgrade zinccopper nakoro and wainaleka projects with historical drilling returning average grades of  zinc and  copper thunderstruck’s fijian property portfolio covers nearly four percent of the main island and includes four main assets the nakoro and wainaleka zinccopper projects the liwa creek gold project and the rama creek copper porphyry in october  thunderstruck acquired a private fijian company holding the assets that thunderstruck resources had previously under option “after three years of working toward this achievement we now own  percent of these highly prospective zinc copper and precious metal targets and have commenced exploration said bryce bradley thunderstruck’s president and ceo “the company has satisfied the multiple conditions required by the various fijian authorities and are entertaining joint venture opportunities on one of our properties” thunderstruck is conducting mapping geochemical and trenching programs on its nakoro liwa creek and rama creek properties to determine drill targets both the nakoro and wainaleka zinccopper projects are the site of successful historic drilling by anglo american thunderstruck resources is managed by an experienced team of geology mining and financial professionals the company’s country manager bill brook has worked as a geologist in fiji for more than four decades and conducted preliminary exploration work on thunderstruck’s project areas in the s before discovering the  ounce gold deposit nearby that is now in development with lion one metals liotsxv cofounding directors brien lundin and bryce bradley have a long history of raising capital and other strategic roles in the natural resource sector to support the advancement of discoveries like their current fijian projects investment highlights with asset purchase complete thunderstruck owns a vast land package of zinc copper gold and silver assets covering nearly four percent of the main island of fiji significant mineral deposits on the main island including vatukoula gold mine tuvatu gold deposit and namosi copper project  holes drilled by anglo with grades up to  percent zinc and two percent copper highgrade zinc copper silver and gold targets mineralization remains open at depth and along strike accomplished management and exploration team q  exploration work has been completed and jv partners are being sought close to asian markets mining in fiji when most people think of fiji mining usually isn’t the first thing that comes to mind however mining in the south pacific nation has been ongoing since the opening of the emperor now vatukoula gold mine in  the island archipelago is located on the pacific ocean’s ring of fire which contains many of the world’s major gold and copper deposits one of the most developed economies in the pacific fiji is served by a miningfriendly government and a reasonable royalty five percent gross profits and tax structure  percent corporate the highly prospective “ring of fire” the vatukoula mine is still in operation and has produced more than seven million ounces of gold in addition to gold fiji also hosts several undeveloped major

thunderstruck’s properties on the main island of viti levu the namosi project contains an estimated resource of  billion tonnes   percent copper and  gt gold fiji is close to asian markets and viti levu has excellent infrastructure including a deepwater port and hydroelectric dam key properties nakoro zinccopper project thunderstruck resources’ main asset is the nakoro zinccopper volcanogenic massive sulphide vms project on the main island of fiji viti levu thunderstruck resources recently acquired percent ownership of the base metal and gold properties portfolio and has recently completed its q exploration work forestry roads extend across the property and the hydroelectric power station at the monasavu dam is only  kilometers northeast of nakoro the project is in the same district as newcrest’s namosi jv project previous drilling by anglo american on a massive sulphide body discovered grades of about five to  percent zinc with zones of highgrade copper at surface further surface exploration work will focus on expanding known zones of zinc and copper mineralization and gold potential on the property will also be assessed in  thunderstruck exposed a small siliceous goldbearing rock sample of  gt gold north of the zinc mineralization between  and  anglo american completed two diamond drill programs at nakoro totaling  meters in  holes over a strike length of approximately

mineralization and  meters   percent zinc  percent copper and  gt silver ending in mineralization in addition float samples taken at that time assayed  percent copper suggesting the property has the potential to host zones of highcopper values the historical and recent exploration work at nakoro has shown a copper zone located at surface with only a few meters of surface oxidation and the historically drilled massive zinc zone open along strike and at depth thunderstruck resources conducted a surface exploration program at nakoro in  assay results from the field work confirmed the potential for highgrade copper mineralization as well as highgrade zinc and silver results from the initial samples include values of  percent and  percent copper  percent and  percent zinc  gold gt

of the main island and  kilometers by modern highway from the deepwater port at the fijian capital of suva historical drilling on the property by anglo american totaled  meters results showed that the main mineralized zone is open at both ends and at depth drill work intersected high grade values including  meters at  percent zinc  percent copper and gt silver  meters at  percent zinc  percent copper and gt silver and  meters at  percent zinc  percent copper and gt silver results from exploration work by the previous owner included surface sampling with assay results from two samples showing  percent copper and  percent zinc and  percent copper and  percent zinc trenching returned an intersection of  meters at  percent copper  percent zinc and gt silver ending in mineralization and a shallow diamond drilling intersection of  meters at  percent copper  percent zinc and  gt silver ending in mineralization two stacked mineralized zones are apparent at wainaleka including a highgrade central zinc zone and an underlying and adjacent copper zone the project has the potential for an initial open pit with only a few meters of surface oxidation which will maximize tonnage for flotation liwa creek gold project the liwa creek gold project is a prospective highgrade gold property on the main island of fiji near the company’s nakoro and wainaleka coppergold vms projects this highpriority area contains classic epithermal highgrade gold veins breccia bodies and silicification zones other than regional sampling minor trenching and grab sampling little exploration has been completed numerous rock samples over a ninesquarekilometer area range in grade from five gt to  gt gold with locally high silver historical data at liwa creek includes assays of  gt gold and  gt

gold from soil sampling and trenching conducted in the s by geopacific limited and a chip sample assaying  gt gold over seven meters has shown the potential for a regional target area this data suggests the area should be the target of further exploration work and has excellent potential to host gold and silver deposits both the country manager and project manager worked on the project rama
