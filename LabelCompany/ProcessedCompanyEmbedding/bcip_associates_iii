posted in uncategorized tagged  filings t bain bcip trust blocker corporation delaware partnership erisa filings financial engineering foreign blocker goldman sachs harry reid ira paul volcker romney ropes  gray sec sep ira tax avoidance taxes ubit on august   in the world of chess being too aggressive at the outset advancing too far is perilous for romney his refusal to acknowledge his aggressive financial engineering and tax avoidance strategies could indeed result in an open convention  one in which the party is free to forward a higher quality candidate here is a list of the facts surrounding the reid romney dispute   on july   i published a blog post noting for the first time that mitt romney has not filed the required t form and paid the related ubit tax with his  tax return nor has he made this required filing in prior years   this filing is essential for tax exempt accounts including iras if they contain related business interests what i call leveraged transactions in romney’s case since bain is an lbo firm remarkably these t filings are all publicly available by law  one need only write to the irs specify the taxpayer and within  days you will receive a reply if these t filings have been made   my request regarding romney applied from   years and the irs confirmed none had been filed   on july   harry reid made a claim to the huffington post that romney paid no taxes for more than  years  while romney may claim that he paid “lots of taxes” reid is technically correct in that he has failed to pay taxes on the largest share of his wealth what is believed to be an ira worth as much as  million for more than  years   romney’s only defense is to claim that all his bain related ira investments were through foreign blocker corporations thereby using a loophole that eliminates the need to file the t and pay the required ubit tax   disclosing this of course proves reid’s claim regarding him paying no taxes even though he may have used a technically legal scheme  it is unlikely the public will care that romney paid other taxes when he has avoided significant required taxes on bain deals in his largest asset the ira   worse for romney would be what is noted in the july   blog post that being that many of his investments in particular those in bcip trust associates i and ii were via a delaware partnership not availing him of the foreign blocker exemption  sec documents clearly indicate this is the case  the most recent personal financial disclosure shows bcip trust associates iii in his ira a foreign blocker yet previous filings show domestic partnerships even more troubling for romney would be any transfer of bain interests from the delaware based partnerships non valid blockers since domestic partnerships are fully subject to ubit  to foreign blocker corporations such as bcip trust associates iii after the initial investment that is recharacterizing the fundamental nature of the partnership   prior to  bain capital utilized a scheme involving sep iras that allowed employees including romney to invest in bain deals  my best guess is that reid’s office asked someone at bain to look at the july  blog post and they confirmed that while at bain they also filed no ts  what this means since the sep is a company sponsored plan  is that no one likely made the required filing including romney  this simply confirms my original analysis reid therefore stands on sound footing with his claim and the romney campaign is foolishly self destructing by not coming clean and clarifying the issue romney should step up say they have a problem and commit to fixing it but this of course would cost his fellow associates at bain a bundle in back taxes observing this conflict between reid and romney  paul volcker comes to mind  in particular volcker’s assertion that engineering belongs in product development not finance read full post »  july    romneys biggest tax story still untold – could result in open republican convention posted in uncategorized tagged  filings t bain capital bcip trust bill esrey blocker corporation edgar online erisa filings erisa rules foreign blocker foundation goldman sachs ira leveraged deals lexis academic mark maremont pension plan portfolio companies presidential candidate private equity republican convention republicans retirement age romney ropes  gray sec filings sep ira smtc corporation sprint tax rules taxes trusts ubit unemployment insurance unrelated business income tax wsj on july   with all the stories on romney’s finances many of which resulted from my observations regarding his tax returns and investment accounts in particular his ira and the interaction of the trusts foundation and bain company filings the most important story is still untold here it is the story that could likely open the republican convention to draft a new candidate  i have been unsuccessful in getting a major reporter to tell the story so i guess i’ll just have to tell it myself i’ll lay it out in simple steps with no conclusions or opinions  it is simply astonishing that the media has not told this story   while head of bain capital mitt romney set up a sepira pension plan that allowed employees to invest in bain deals  mark maremont of the wsj did a fine story on this   iras are tax exempt and like other tax exempts must file a special return a t if they are invested in leveraged transactions  this is as straightforward as requiring employers to pay unemployment insurance for employees as part of periodic payroll transactions  the purpose of the t is to recognize the ubit or unrelated business income tax the rate of which approximates the corporate rate of  percent congress adopted this approach for obvious reasons in that if an investor was getting tax exempt income in an ira let’s say interest income on a leveraged debt offering and on the other side of the fence the borrower was taking large interest expense deductions the net impact would be a double deduction and a grossly dysfunctional tax system  bain capital is a leveraged buyout firm in which employees invested in numerous “bain deals” via their ira accounts  these investments are leveraged and clearly subject to ubit tax  other leading private equity firms do not allow employees to invest in their own deals via ira accounts   all t returns including those relating to iras are by law public  one need only make a request to the irs  in april i made such a request for bain and  top executives including romney for their sep iras covering the period   the irs responded none had been filed  in addition i also confirmed no filings were made from  with respect to the new bain capital pension plan set up by ropes and gray in which the official retirement age is  not a misprint   maremont of the wsj also reported on this “unusually young” retirement age   the only way to escape the t requirement and ubit tax is to make the investment through a foreign blocker corporation   domestic corporations are fully subject to the ubit and leading law firms are very careful in structuring partnerships to account for this that is making sure such investments go through a foreign blocker corporation   edgar online is a public corporation ticker edgr effectively controlled by bain capital via a convertible bond issue  sec filings clearly indicate this control summarized in edgar online’s executives own words edgar online is in the business of summarizing  sec data in user friendly formats that are widely used in the financial and media world  many leading databases including lexis academic which is available in most public libraries use edgar online  one need only search for mitt romney using the lexis academic database while specifying a search database of “sec filings” from  to see a list of references   in but one example on february   smtc corp ticker smtx filed a g report on behalf of bain capital  under section item a name of filing person it specifically states that bcip trust associates ii is a delaware partnership not a foreign blocker corporation   this form also states romney is the sole shareholder of bain capital and the only “control person” capable of declaring a special dividend   erisa rules require pension plans to be trusts  for example if i want to set up a pension plan for joe’s consulting with td ameritrade the title for each participant’s account would be joe’s consulting pension trust fbo followed by the employee name  for example joe’s consulting pension trust fbo jane doe would be one employee and joe’s consulting pension trust fbo mitt romney would be another  the reason is to make absolutely certain each employee’s assets are held in and protected by a separate trust which is required by erisa rules in romney’s ira note that he is not invested in bcip associates ii but rather bcip “trust ” associates  the key word “trust” is a calling card for the ira  this can be seen in his recently filed  personal financial disclosure statement  note that the most recent filing shows bcip trust associates iii not ii  trust iii is identified as a foreign blocker in sec filings yet in previous filings romney was in trust ii and its predecessor both domestic delaware corporations   the g filing regarding smtc corporation on behalf of bain referred to in item  of this analysis specifically says bcip trust associates ii is a delaware corporation not a foreign blocker if this sec filing is accurate and it certainly is then not only romney but many other bain employees have failed to file the required t returns and pay the necessary ubit tax   other leading private equity firms including kkr and blackstone do not allow employees to invest in company deals via retirement accounts for good reason  perhaps bain just got too greedy consistent with its fees being  percent higher than the industry average there is a whole cottage industry of law firms that advise tax exempt investors on how to avoid ubit by using foreign blocker corporations  these clients include leading endowments such as harvard and yale foundations such as the gates foundation and public pensions romney says he trusts his advisors yet that was clearly a mistake  they have failed him in not only setting up a valid blind trust but also a credible investment approach for a presidential candidate  see february   blog post for related material and comparison to bill esrey former ceo of sprint more importantly if these filings made by one of bain capital’s portfolio companies smtc and summarized via another entity they effectively control edgar online are accurate then romney is indeed involved in a massive tax fraud and by nature disqualified from being a viable candidate for president this is not
