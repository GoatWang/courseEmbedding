 marketfield asset management marketfield asset management llc marketfield is a registered investment advisor that offers discretionary portfolio management for private and institutional clients typically as advisor or subadvisor to funds and products the firm is an absolute return manager that attempts to provide returns on capital substantially in excess of the risk free rate rather than matching any particular index or external benchmark the products we manage are intended to offer the portfolio flexibility typically associated with private partnerships with the structural advantages of more traditional regulated products marketfield asset management®  marketfield fund® investment philosophy the foundation of our investment process is the managers’ constant and thorough assessment of general macroeconomic and business conditions recognizing these processes is paramount if a manager is to avoid the types of risk that can permanently impair a portfolio and remain able to capitalize on the opportunities that regularly follow periods of severe distress the goal is to identify businesses and other investment media that will be most affected by large scale external economic forces the senior management team at marketfield has a long public record of anticipating and responding appropriately as macroeconomic conditions evolve from one cycle to the next over time we have shown an ability to act appropriately in a wide variety of market conditions and we believe that the willingness to change both our intellectual and portfolio positioning is a key factor in delivering acceptable returns to our clients we communicate our thoughts constantly both through our written research and direct dialogue maintaining an unusual level of access to senior management the products we manage are structured with very broad charters in recognition of the widely different asset and security types that can exhibit leadership from one cycle to the next our style while encompassing a wide array of potential asset classes will normally concentrate capital in those specific assets that stand to derive the most benefit or harm in the case of short positions from the macroeconomic forces that we anticipate although our mandate is necessarily broad in any particular cycle we are likely to utilize only a small portion of the allowable range of instruments

survey a fund family must have at least three funds in lipper’s general usstock category one in world equity which combines global and international funds one mixedequity fund which holds stocks and bonds at least two taxablebond funds and one taxexempt offering each fund’s returns are adjusted for b fees fund loads or sales charges aren’t included in the calculation of returns either each fund’s return is measured against those of all funds in its lipper category such as say smallcap value that leads to a percentile ranking with  the highest and  the lowest which is then weighted by asset size relative to the fund family’s other assets in its general classification world equity for instance if a family’s biggest funds do well that boosts its overall ranking poor performance in a big fund would have the opposite effect finally the score is multiplied by the weighting of its general classification as determined by the entire lipper universe of funds the category weightings for the oneyear results general equity  world equity  mixed equity  taxable bonds  and taxexempt bonds  the category weightings for the fiveyear results general equity  world equity  mixed equity  taxable

that score is then multiplied by  general equity’s overall weighting in lipper’s universe so it would be  x  which totals  similar calculations are done for each fund in the study then all the numbers are added up for a total score the fund family with the highest score wins both for every category and overall the same process is repeated for the five and year rankings based on their weightings

discretionary portfolio management for private and institutional clients typically as advisor or subadvisor to funds and products the firm is an absolute return manager that attempts to provide returns on capital substantially in excess of the risk free rate rather than matching any particular index or external benchmark the products we manage are intended to offer the portfolio flexibility typically associated with private partnerships with the structural advantages of more traditional regulated products marketfield asset management®  marketfield fund® investment philosophy the foundation of our investment process is the managers’ constant and thorough assessment of general macroeconomic and business conditions recognizing these processes is paramount if a manager is to avoid the types of risk that can permanently impair a portfolio and remain able to capitalize on the opportunities that regularly follow periods of severe distress the goal is to identify businesses and other investment media that will be most affected by large scale external economic forces the senior management team at marketfield has a long public record of anticipating and responding appropriately as macroeconomic conditions evolve from one cycle to the next over time we have shown an ability to act appropriately in a wide variety of market conditions and we believe that the willingness to change both our intellectual and portfolio positioning is a key factor in delivering acceptable returns to our clients we communicate our thoughts constantly both through our written research and direct dialogue maintaining an unusual level of access to senior management the products we manage are structured with very broad charters in recognition of the widely different asset and security types that can exhibit leadership from one cycle to the next our style while encompassing a wide array of potential asset classes will normally concentrate capital in those specific assets that stand to derive the most benefit or harm in the case of short positions from the macroeconomic forces that we anticipate although our mandate is necessarily broad in any particular cycle we are likely to utilize only a small portion of the allowable range of instruments marketfield asset management® is the name used by marketfield for investment advisory services investment products us
