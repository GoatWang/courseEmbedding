a proprietary electrocoagulation process in this stage a mild electrical field is applied in specifically designed long tubes causing the contaminants to coagulate or “clump” together  electroflotation the clumpedup material travels into a second stage where another low power electrical field generates a cloud of microbubbles that gently lifts the contaminants to the surface for harvesting together these stages accomplish an important third function electrooxidation which is effective in removing pathogens for example the harvested concentrate can be made up of waste
