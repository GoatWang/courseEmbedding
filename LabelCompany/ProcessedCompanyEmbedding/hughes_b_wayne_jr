united states close politics   am et  updated oct   california prison reforms biggest backer is also friends with karl rove by matt sledge ben horton via getty images  thousands of california prisoners could be released if state voters pass a referendum downgrading certain nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors next month if that happens the inmates will owe a debt of gratitude to a conservative multimillionaire named b wayne hughes jr hughes is that rare businessman who manages to embrace hollywood wall street and the church pew he invests in real estate surfs in malibu plays cowboy on his ranch and prays in the prison ministries he supports now his fortune may help power california proposition  to victory at the ballot box marking a milestone in americans changing attitudes toward incarceration i was approached by some of my friends on the left i didnt know i had friends on the left hughes told the huffington post i said ok i will go ahead and write the first check he has donated  million to the campaign outpacing netflix ceo reed hastings and a george sorosbacked foundation perhaps thats because the yearold malibu californiabased scion of the public storage empire with holdings worth hundreds of millions of dollars has a stake in prison reform deeper than money alone his passion began in an unlikely place at the ronald reagan presidential library an institution devoted to the man who dramatically expanded the war on drugs in the s at an event there in  hughes met chuck colson a former richard nixon henchman who founded a large prison ministry after serving seven months for the watergate coverup colson pitched hughes who says he became a serious christian only in his s on backing prison fellowship ministries in california for hughes the call coincided with his own growing disillusionment with washington politics throughout much of  and leading up to the  midterm elections he partnered with karl rove to fund republican candidates hughes served as a board member of the american action network a rovelinked group that does not disclose its donors separately he gave hundreds of thousands of dollars directly to republicans while he received a welcome political education hughes recalled his disappointment when he realized that i was going to be told whatever i wanted to hear as long as i wrote a check so back in california he turned his attention to projects that might more directly benefit his home state after the meeting with colson he took a trip to the louisiana state penitentiary in angola where he observed the prisons bible college in operation hughes has spent millions expanding a prisoners to pastors program in california from  to  inmates and two to  prisons he has also supported prisoner reentry programs ninetynine percent of everybodys going to get out he explained and who do we want getting out  someone whos angrier and more dangerous than they went in or do we want somebody whos thinking about issues about peace and praise and forgiveness if prop  passes hughes noted it could cut down on the target audience for prison ministries but he said anything is better off than being in prison for these men and women who have committed these felonies nationally the burgeoning network of prison ministries has attracted criticism from some on the left for favoring the christian faith over others but hughes has received a warm embrace from many liberal groups in california fighting to reverse the states toughoncrime policies of the s the notion that we have spent too much money on prisons and that we need to do something different with criminal justice is a notion thats shared across the political spectrum said lenore anderson the leader of the proposition  campaign she was the friend on the left who first approached hughes californias  threestrikes law mandated a sentence of  years to life for anyone convicted of a third felony violent or not that law and harsh drug penalties helped to swell the states prison population from  in the s to  by  by  california voters had had enough deciding overwhelmingly to curb the threestrikes laws most draconian provisions separately the us supreme court ordered the state to release tens of thousands of inmates in  finding the prisons overcrowded conditions to be unconstitutional that slow process is ongoing now comes prop  which would downgrade drug crimes and other nonviolent offenses like petty theft from felonies to misdemeanors the initiative is sponsored by the nonprofit californians for safety and justice which is led by anderson since january she said hughes has become an absolutely critical spokesman cutting television ads to show that the referendum has meaningful conservative support for hughes not previously much in the news the campaign has been a public coming out of sorts it has also been an opportunity to mix with faces on the left he has met liberal christians all of them know the precept of love your neighbor civil rights activist and former obama official van jones a very nice guy and other prop  supporters like dionne wilson a police officers widow who found solace in buddhism and prison rehabilitation programs i really believe in the power of redemption and so does wayne deeply said wilson hughes personal plea to the california republican party to back prison reform was shot down but a recent poll found that rankandfile republican voters support the measure by a  to  percent margin when it passes  the next place for parties to come together are issues around mental health
