volatility in  alternative addressing market volatility in   tripp zimmerman  associate director of research tweet share feedback regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out or underperform market capweighted indexes over long periods we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles partly by tilting toward known return premiums in  value and size ie small caps underperformed but momentum quality and low volatility outperformed now the question is what factors will perform best in  and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market wisdomtree recently created the wisdomtree dynamic longshort us equity index wtdls designed to generate alpha at the core with a multifactor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically key features to wisdomtree approach wisdomtree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade typically focusing on signal factors such as value quality and size but now we are pleased to introduce this new multifactor approach the wisdomtree dynamic long us equity index wtdl is the long component of wtdls and comprises approximately  stocks with the highest combined fundamentals which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly • fundamental selection stocks are graded on a combination of growth quality and value factors and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion it is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another by combining quality and value factors which we believe complement each other we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term while still tapping into the longterm return premiums   • lowvolatility weighting in each sector the index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market we know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor so we believe applying it to a multifactor selection model will also add value   • sectorneutral capping the index targets a sectorneutral allocation when compared to the largest  us stocks by market capitalization we believe this keeps the index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or lowvolatility weighting to significantly over or underweight certain sectors we are confident about the stock selection and weighting process so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a capweighted index to get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process we compared wtdl against popular market capweighted style and factor indexes   index valuations for definitions of terms and indexes in the chart visit our glossary   • attractive across multiple valuation measures we find it impressive but not surprising that wtdl scored high on multiple valuation measures as of  wtdl had the highest dividend yield it also showed similar pricetoearnings pe ratios as the sp  value index both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value wtdl had the secondhighest quality metrics defined by return on equity roe and return on assets roa a very close second only to the msci usa quality index which focuses more directly on that factor lastly wtdl had higher profit margins than the sp  index and very similar growth expectations   dynamic hedging indicator the above table highlights how wtdl had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy for one thing the lowvolatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator the dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage so when the fundamentals or profits of the universe are deteriorating the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage similarly as valuations become more stretched adding risk to the portfolio the indicator would look to hedge as well while our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of  and signaled to be  hedge for january  making the net equity exposure for wtdls  or market neutral we believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for          sources
