senior housing reit jordan wathen tmfvaluemagnet nov   at pm to say that newcastle investment corp nysenct is complex would be the understatement of the year the reit owns a hodgepodge of financial assets ranging from senior housing to debt investments and newspapers yes newspapers this isnt your average reit the companys thirdquarter earnings report was relatively benign but three things stuck out to me  its actually becoming a senior housing reit maybeive been critical of newcastle investment corp in earlier articles particularly one about its new newspaper investments it now calls new media at the time  and even now  newspapers seem like one giant distraction on the companys quest to become a senior housingfocused reit however the company made some progress on the senior housing front it acquired  million of new assets using  million of debt and  of cash equity in all newcastle has  new communities under its growing umbrella the majority of the new acquisitions  were in florida an obvious market for a senior housing investor the florida purchase is particularly notable because of its size but also because of the potential for operating improvements newcastles latest quarterly filing shows an average occupancy rate of  for its recent acquisition rival health care reit nysehcn has an average occupancy rate of  in its senior housing portfolio according to the companys last quarterly supplement newcastle investment corp investors should use health care reits portfolio as an example for the potential profits in senior housing all in all newcastle reports levered yields from its new investments at  modest rental increases and vacancy rate improvements could send that quickly up to its target of  per year on its equity investment management noted that it had big senior housing deals in the pipeline one of which includes a potential equity investment of  million to  million  newspaper spinoff to make headlines in januarynewcastle now expects to take control of newspaper company gatehouse media form new media and spin off new media in a stock dividend perhaps as early as january  new media is without a doubt the biggest question mark for newcastle shareholders newcastle will own roughly  of new media according to the september presentation using its expected funds from operations of  million for  new media should deliver  million in earnings power to current newcastle shareholders how the company prices at its initial public offering is the most important part of the puzzle if priced at a  yield current newcastle shareholders would see their ownership worth  million or roughly onefourth of newcastle investments current market value well know more about the company when newcastle can file a full s for a spinoff with the sec the company still has to form new media and leverage it with debt under the new subsidiary before taking it public as a standalone company  more cdo realizationsnewcastles collateralized debt obligations play an important role in its move to become a senior housing reit this quarter it restructured one collateralized debt obligation selling a senior tranche for  million in cash while holding onto a  million position the cdos and debt investments are newcastles piggy bank as it makes its transformation when asked on the conference call if newcastle would continue to liquidate its other cdos ceo kenneth riis said they are generating still good returns and good cash flows for us i think as assets payoff and deleverage the transactions then we will look to potentially harvest the capital out of those he later added that even if its a slightly lower return initially its a positive thing for us because that capital will be traded at a higher returns than our cdo assets would referencing that hes willing to cash in on the cdos to invest in real estate hes right wall street will likely value the cash flows from senior housing much higher than money from alphabetsoup cdos slow and steady improvements all aroundnewcastle investment shareholders should be happy with the companys transition to a senior housing reit though the newspaper business has served as a distraction the ipo would set newcastle up to become a highyield senior housing asset with dividends that are well above other senior housing companies like health care reit newcastle investments immediate  levered yields on new acquisitions are proof that there is plenty of money to be made as an equity reit now it just needs to execute  fool contributor jordan wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned and neither
