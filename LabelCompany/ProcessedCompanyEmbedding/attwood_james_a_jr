verified purchase reviewstop customer reviews out of  starsmay be better than advertisedbycharleson december  verified purchaselove this thing easily installed on hp honda i did dremel it a bit for better fit and amazing difference with just a  jon boat it is very stern heavy and i used to have to move myself far forward to even make plane then id have cavitation issues on plane now i make plane in  the time and no cavitation even noticed that its significantly more stable and easier to drivethe product advertises less drag than other hydrofoils ive found that true and the packaging explains how it uses gull wings which angle up slightly and mostly stick above the water when on plane thereby reducing drag at higher speeds i verified that today and about  of wings were above wateralso this jr is one of the few foils specifically made for smaller outboards its not a one size fits all like manyas advertised if not betterread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsbought as a temproary fix and now cant see a reason not to have onebybill oconnoron august  verified purchasei bouth this to help with cavitation that was occuring due to the shaft on the  hp honda motor i bought for a  whaler being too long for the notched stern of the whaler i put this pair together in july thinking i would eliminate the nocch in the stern of the whaler by building it up with fiberglass and in raising the enginestern height  this fall without modification the boat took forever to plane and even when it did the cavitation created tons of backsplash over the sterni bought hydrostabilizer jr hoping to achieve plane easier and reduce the cavitation but did not expect the results i got from this purchase the first one i recieved was clearly used and repackaged so i sent it back and got another the replacement had some slight defect in the plastic molding that required a little sanding in the gap that fits over theoutboards fins to make them seat properly on the engine once i overcame those issues this product worked better than advertised for my situationthe boat planes very quickly and while there is still backsplash over the stern it is minimal compared to before i chose not to wait until fall to raise the engine and purchased an adjustable stern plate that raises the engine to meet my required height at the stern and am now extremely happy with the way the hydrostabilizer jr has improved my boats performanceread morecomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of
