board to stymie strategic interest news provided by starboard value lp may    et share this article new york may   prnewswire  starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard one of the largest shareholders of depomed inc nasdaq depo with an ownership interest in approximately  of depomeds outstanding shares today announced it has delivered an open letter to depomed shareholders and intends to recommence the process for calling a special meeting of depomed shareholders for removing and replacing the current depomed board of directors with a modified slate of six highly qualified director nominees the full text of the letter follows may   dear fellow shareholders starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard currently has an ownership interest in approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed inc depomed or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we believe that depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the board of directors the board to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders unfortunately as we outlined in our previous letter to depomed on april th we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies questionable capital allocation decisions and egregious actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring depomed we believe the board clearly lacks the independence objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders to that end we will be delivering to depomed today a new written request in accordance with depomeds bylaws that the board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting the record date request notice for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current board this record date request notice supersedes our initial request delivered to depomed dated april   the initial record date request notice  as you may recall the initial record date request notice was delivered to depomed in order to preserve our rights under california law and mitigate the risk that depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights since delivering the initial record date request notice we have undertaken an extensive process to carefully vet a slate of highlyqualified nominees that included the evaluation of over  qualified potential candidates we have selected a group of six candidates possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to depomeds business and current challenges including pharmaceutical operations healthcare regulatory finance board governance and oversight and mergers and acquisitions expertise collectively our slate of director nominees has decades of experience serving on wellperforming public company boards importantly this group of nominees if elected at the special meeting is prepared to serve the shareholders of depomed and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance we appreciate that the board promptly set a record date in response to our initial record date request notice thereby demonstrating that it does not intend to unnecessarily delay the calling of a special meeting by shareholders while we also appreciate the boards intentions in amending its  poison pill rights plan poison pill to facilitate our delivery of the requisite requests from shareholders in order to call the special meeting there are other considerations as a d filer that make us uncomfortable with the idea of soliciting and delivering requests from other depomed shareholders without conducting a public solicitation therefore today we are filing preliminary proxy materials with the sec in furtherance of soliciting the requisite requests to deliver the special meeting request our expectation is that the board will adhere to a similar timetable in setting a record date for this record date request notice as it did with our initial record date request notice and we look forward to calling a special meeting of shareholders in the near future we are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly wellqualified to serve as directors of depomed we have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees

three incumbent directors in addition to starboards two highly qualified advisors if successful in replacing the board at the special meeting news provided by starboard value lp sep    et share this article new york sept   prnewswire  starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard one of the largest shareholders of depomed inc depomed nasdaq depo with beneficial ownership of approximately  of depomeds outstanding shares today announced it has delivered an open letter to depomed shareholders  starboard also announced that as of this past friday it has delivered to depomed more than the required consents to call a special meeting of depomed shareholders and has set november   as the date for the special meeting  the full text of starboards letter to depomed shareholders follows september   dear fellow shareholders starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard and director nominees currently owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed inc depomed or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we believe that depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the board of directors the board to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders unfortunately a series of shareholderunfriendly actions by the board over the past two years have led us to conclude that management and the board are not acting in the best interest of all shareholders we therefore continue to believe it is necessary to make substantial changes to the composition of the board as soon as possible so that steps can be taken to create value for the benefit of all shareholders as you may recall we initiated the process to call a special meeting of shareholders the special meeting on april   and subsequently on july   announced that we would proceed with a consent solicitation to call the special meeting by going through the procedures required for a shareholder to call a special meeting under depomeds bylaws by soliciting the support of the holders of at least  of depomeds outstanding shares entitled to vote as of friday we delivered to depomed more than the required consents and have therefore initiated the calling of the special meeting to be held on november    we continue to have significant concerns that depomeds board is not looking out for the best interests of shareholders  this was first evident during horizon pharma plcs horizon attempt to acquire the company and was then reaffirmed by the boards stealthy attempt to strip certain important shareholder rights earlier this year under the guise of a delaware reincorporation proposal  we have been steadfast that in light of these egregious actions the company clearly needs a new board to ensure that shareholders rights are properly and fully represented based on recent press reports it appears that depomed may have hired bankers to explore a sale  as we have outlined publicly we believe depomed would be extremely attractive to numerous potential acquirers and while there exists an opportunity to significantly improve operations at the company an outright sale may be the best option for unlocking shareholder value  however we remain extremely concerned that any potential sale process may not be undertaken with genuine intent but rather as a smokescreen to distract from the required board changes we are seeking and protect the current boards positions beyond the special meeting  we also do not trust the current board to steward any sale process given the lengths the board went to rebuff the approach by horizon in   following the boards mishandling of the horizon acquisition proposal it is imperative that any sale process be squarely focused on maximizing value for all shareholders  depomed refused to engage with horizon despite its  per share offer at a  premium and despite having expressed a willingness to raise the deal price according to a proxy filing made by horizon in november  horizon and its advisors reached out to depomed to attempt to engage in acquisition discussions on more than  different occasions and not once did depomed or its advisors meaningfully engage with horizon instead this board not only avoided horizon but also unilaterally amended the bylaws to make it extremely difficult for shareholders to have their voices heard on horizons offer sued horizon and adopted a poison pill is this the type of board you can trust to conduct a robust sale process to maximize the value of your investment unfortunately according to recent press reports the companys actions regarding horizon appear to be eerily similar to multiple other recent potential suitors who have reached out to try to engage with the company on numerous occasions only to be rebuffed  clearly the company has a history of refusing to engage with potential suitors and not acting in the best interests of shareholders  press reports state that the company has not yet begun a sale process but may do so in the future  we have little confidence that the company will begin a thorough and genuine process that includes all potential suitors in a manner designed to successfully maximize value for all shareholders  therefore we believe that it is necessary for directors proposed by starboard to be involved in any sale process at the board level to ensure that the board is actually and capably representing the best interests of shareholders and that value is maximized record datewe have been advised that depomed has notified broadridge financial solutions of a september   record date for the special meeting  it is crucial that shareholders take whatever steps may be needed with their custodial banks and brokerage firms to ensure that they have the ability to vote their shares at the special meeting it is important for shareholders to understand that while we firmly believe a change of the majority of the board is warranted we do not practically have any other option for seeking board composition changes at the special meeting but to seek the removal of the entire board  this is because certain provisions under california law and the companys bylaws make it extremely difficult if not virtually impossible to remove any fewer than all of the companys directors  effectively if shareholders were to vote against the removal of even just one depomed director at the special meeting then a directorprotecting cumulative voting provision is triggered with respect to every other director thereby making the voting threshold required to remove any directors extraordinarily high and virtually impracticable in light of these unfortunate technical factors combined with the serious governance and operational deficiencies at depomed we intend to vigorously pursue replacement of the entire board to ensure that depomed is being run in a manner consistent with the best interests of all shareholders  over the coming weeks leading up to the special meeting we will be sharing additional details on our concerns regarding the serious corporate governance issues questionable capital allocation decisions and actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring depomed  we believe the board clearly lacks the independence objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of all shareholders as we progress towards the special meeting we are extremely pleased to remind you of the highly qualified slate of candidates that we are proposing to be elected as the new board of depomed including our highly qualified advisors who would be invited to join the new board if we are successful  we believe that we have selected a group of individuals possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to depomeds business and current challenges including pharmaceutical operations healthcare regulatory finance board governance and oversight and mergers and acquisitions expertise  collectively our advisors and slate of director nominees have decades of experience serving on wellperforming public company boards  importantly this group of nominees if elected at the special meeting together with our highly qualified advisors is prepared to serve the shareholders of depomed and to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance  we have provided summary biographies of each of our nominees and advisors below continuityin addition in order to maintain a degree of continuity on the new board in the event that the current board is removed and our nominees are elected at the special meeting the new board would be willing to increase the size of the board to eleven members and add back up to three incumbent directors  as a reminder we utilized this construct successfully at darden restaurants where we replaced the entire board and then added back one of the prior board members we look forward to sharing additional details on our plans for depomed and engaging with you over the coming weeks as we approach the special meeting  as one of the largest shareholders of the company our interests are directly aligned with yours  we firmly believe that our proposed changes are in the best interest of all shareholders    highlights of starboards nominees and advisors biographies in alphabetical order john j

firefox »yahoosearchsearchsign inus markets closedsp  dow  nasdaq starboard delivers letter to depomed shareholderspr newswirejuly  reblogsharetweetsharenew york july   prnewswire  starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard one of the largest shareholders of depomed inc depo with an ownership interest in approximately  of depomeds outstanding shares today announced it has delivered an open letter to depomed shareholders the full text of the letter followsjuly  dear fellow shareholdersstarboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard and director nominees currently owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed inc depomed or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we believe that depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the board of directors the board to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholdersas we outlined in our may th letter to depomed shareholders we delivered a written request to depomed in accordance with its bylaws that the board set a record date the record date request notice for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders the special meeting for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current board  this record date request notice superseded our initial request delivered to depomed dated april   the initial record date request notice  as you may recall the initial record date request notice was delivered to depomed in order to preserve our rights to call a special meeting under california law and mitigate the risk that depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights  given the boards disturbing history of taking actions aimed at limiting shareholder rights we simply could not afford to take any riskswe continue to have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies questionable capital allocation decisions and actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring depomed  we believe the board clearly lacks the independence objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholdersfollowing our initial evaluation of well over  qualified potential board candidates we have continued to meet with numerous pharmaceutical executives to supplement our slate with additional pharmaceutical experience  unfortunately given the extensive requirements and restrictions under the depomed bylaws for calling the special meeting the addition of any new highly qualified nominees to our slate at this time would effectively require us to submit a new record date request notice to depomed thereby restarting the clock under the bylaws for the special meeting and further delaying our efforts to remove and replace the board  further delay is unpalatable therefore we have instead appointed two exceptionally qualified former senior pharmaceutical executives – robert g savage and james l tyree – as advisors to assist in our solicitation efforts given their significant industry knowledge and experience  if our special meeting solicitation ultimately proves successful we would invite messrs savage and tyree to join the board and they have indicated their desire to do soas a brief background mr savage was the former worldwide chairman for the pharmaceuticals group at johnson  johnson where he was responsible for one of the worlds largest pharmaceutical organizations with annual sales of almost  billion in   mr tyree was the former executive vice president pharmaceutical products at abbott laboratories with annual pharmaceutical products division sales of almost  billion in   we are confident that you will find messrs savage and tyree to be incredibly wellqualified to serve as directors of depomed given their extensive experience as senior executives of multibillion dollar pharmaceutical divisions at two of the worlds largest and most wellrespected healthcare companies  they supplement what we already believe to be an exceptional slate of board nominees who collectively possess a proven track record of corporate governance best practices and shareholder value creation  we believe that together our advisors and current board nominees would create an allstar board that would work diligently and collaboratively to protect and represent the best interests of shareholdersread morein addition in order to maintain a degree of continuity amidst the required change that we believe is desperately needed at depomed in the event that the current board is removed and our nominees are elected at the special meeting the new board would be willing to increase the size of the board to nine members currently there are six members adding mr savage and mr tyree would expand the board to eight members and add back one incumbent director  as a reminder we utilized this construct successfully at darden restaurants where we replaced the entire board and then added back one of the prior board memberstoday we are also announcing that we will proceed with our original solicitation to call the special meeting by going through the procedures required for a shareholder to call a special meeting under depomeds bylaws by soliciting the support of the holders of at least  of depomeds outstanding shares entitled to vote  the company has set a record date of august   the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to provide their written request to call the special meeting  following the record date starboard will have up to  days to deliver the written requests to depomed along with the other information required under the bylaws including the date starboard would like to set for holding the special meeting the special meeting notice which cannot be less than  nor more than  days after starboard submits the special meeting notice following depomeds receipt of our initial record date request notice on april   the board responded promptly by setting a record date for april th or less than three weeks later  depomed knew that our initial record date request notice was a placeholder and that we would be revising our slate of nominees which under depomeds onerous bylaw provisions would require that we submit a new record date request notice  on may   we delivered the new record date request notice with our updated board slate  however in yet another sign of entrenchment this time the board responded by setting a record date of august   or close to three months later  shareholders should know that the board delayed the record date to almost the full extent it is permitted to delay such an action under its bylaws  this is in stark contrast to the commentary from depomed to shareholders on april  depomed believes that the selection of an early meeting date is in the best interest of depomed and its shareholders  based upon starboards stated goals of making this an efficient process and its stated need to immediately bring to a vote the replacement of the entire board we encourage you and your advisors to work collaboratively with us to hold the special meeting as soon as possible          jim schoeneckapparently when the company realized that we had assembled a highly qualified slate they no longer wished to hold the meeting as soon as possible  this is yet another example of the board attempting to disenfranchise shareholders and further entrench itself and bares an eerie resemblance to the delay tactics that depomed used against horizon pharma plc horizon during horizons failed acquisition proposal of depomed  as you may recall depomed filed a lawsuit attempting to permanently enjoin horizon from ever being able to acquire depomedwe see the boards rationale of basing the prolonged meeting date on the nucynta litigation as a classic baitandswitch  upon our first placeholder nomination there was no mention of delaying the special meeting until the outcome of the pending nucynta patent litigation  however the most recent letter from depomed to its shareholders details depomed believes the companys shareholders should know the outcome of the nucynta patent litigation clarifying the patent exclusivity of the companys most important asset  we believe that this stated reason for delaying the special meeting is completely disingenuousgiven our ownership stake and that calling the special meeting would only require one shareholder to consent we have decided at this point to control the timing of the special meeting  we will proceed with our seccompliant solicitation process to ensure that shareholders have their voices heard and to prevent depomed from any further attempts to manipulate our special meeting process and disenfranchise shareholders with needless stratagems  we have concluded that this is the best course of action given our overwhelming lack of confidence that the board will engage in a goodfaith and expeditious manneras we continue to progress towards the special meeting we are extremely pleased to remind you of the highly qualified slate of candidates that we are proposing to be the new board of directors of depomed including our highly qualified advisors who would be added to the board if we are successful  we believe that we have selected a group of individuals possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to depomeds business and current challenges including pharmaceutical operations healthcare regulatory finance board governance and oversight and mergers and acquisitions expertise  collectively our advisors and slate of director nominees have decades of experience serving on wellperforming public company boards  importantly this group of nominees if elected at the special meeting together with our highly qualified advisors is prepared to serve the shareholders of depomed and to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance  we have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees and advisors below  over the coming weeks we intend to share our detailed views on depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the special meetinghighlights of starboards nominees and advisors biographies in alphabetical orderjohn j deluccamr delucca was cfo and
