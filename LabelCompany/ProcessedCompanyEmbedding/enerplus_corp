based in canada is engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas its canadian operations span alberta british columbia and saskatchewan enerplus also has positions in the united states with properties in montana north dakota pennsylvania west virginia and wyoming the energy producer boasts a rich portfolio focused on highquality lowdecline oil and gas assets the company was established in  as enerplus resources fund that same year it completed a  million initial public offering and began operating as canadas first oil and gas royalty trust in  enerplus became a corporate entity with approval from  of unitholders and changed its name to enerplus corp it currently trades on both the new york and toronto stock exchanges under the ticker symbol erf the company is incorporated in california with principal offices in calgary alberta since its inception enerplus has strived to maintain a balance between oil and natural gas production in an effort to mitigate the risk associated with each commodity at the end of  the company’s production volume consisted of  oil and liquids and  natural gas for  it is estimated that theses percentages will be  and  respectively four core areas make up about  of enerplus’ total corporate production the estimated break down for  is us oil – williston basin  us natural gas – marcellus  canadian oil – waterfloods  canadian gas – deep basin  the bulk of production spending has been concentrated on the company’s oil projects in the united states and its canadian oil properties of late enerplus has performed well so far in  logging a topline gain of about  in the first quarter with a solid profit and the nearterm outlook appears favorable for the oil and gas producer with top and bottomline gains likely for the full year indeed following an unusually harsh winter in canada and the united states oil production has seemingly perked up and will likely remain healthy through the remainder of  longterm prospects for enerplus appear solid as well with continued advances in sales and earnings probable from an investment perspective the stock has done quite well of late after taking a bit of a nosedive over the  period erf has climbed more than  since the start of this year and given enerplus’ rosy outlook it seems as though this issue still has room to run what’s more the company pays a nice dividend which is likely to grow in the years ahead its yield is currently well above the value line median all told enerplus seems to have a solid grip on the oil and gas market which should only strengthen in the coming years this stock may well suit a number of investment strategies for a more thorough review of this company we recommend consulting our fullpage report in the current issue of the value line investment survey as well as future quarterly reviews interested subscribers are also encouraged to take note of any supplementary reports that may follow detailing newsworthy items
