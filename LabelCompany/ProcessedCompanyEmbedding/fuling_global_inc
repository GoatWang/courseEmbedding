offering expenses payable by us we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately  million from this offering or approximately  million if the oversubscription option is exercised in full we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows as to such uses in china after we complete the remittance process described below and we have listed the specific uses of proceeds below if and to the extent the oversubscription option is exercised we intend to use any such proceeds for our working capital needs and to replace other sources of funding mentioned below where projects require more capital to complete than we anticipate raising in this offering amount percentage of description of use  million net proceeds united states operation of allentown factory and development of us sales

development  sales employee recruiting and training  total  approximately twothirds of the net proceeds from this offering will be remitted to china before we are able to use those funds to expand our business we are permitted under prc laws and regulations to provide funding to taizhou fuling through capital contributions or parentsubsidiary loans subject to approvals from or registrations with relevant prc government authorities we plan to use the capital contribution to fund taizhou fuling we expect that a properly submitted application will be approved in the ordinary course of business however we cannot guarantee such an approval will occur or be timely if our application for a capital contribution is denied we will use the parentsubsidiary loan method of funding taizhou fuling as mentioned we currently anticipate financing our subsidiaries by means of capital contributions we currently anticipate using a portion of the net proceeds from this offering total net proceeds of approximately  million to increase the registered capital of taizhou fuling after which time taizhou fuling may apply such funds to building a new facility in wenling and research and development the increase in registered capital will require prior approval from i mofcom to increase taizhou fuling’s registered capital ii saic to alter taizhou fuling’s business certificate to reflect the increase in registered capital and iii safe to allow taizhou fuling’s bank to convert us dollars into rmb in order to fund such increased registered capital or each of the foregoing agencies’ respective local counterparts this approval process typically takes  to  days in total and sometimes longer from the time mofcom or its local branches receive all the required application documents to begin the process we plan to remit money to china using the capital contribution method the approval from mofcom is the key approval in the capital contribution process and we believe all other approvals are ministerial if mofcom approves such increase in registered capital we have not yet initiated this process but intend to start the process immediately upon completion of the offering we do not foresee any problem receiving necessary government approvals for a capital contribution however if our application is rejected we would remit money to china through a parentsubsidiary loan instead if we were to provide funding to taizhou fuling through parentsubsidiary loans rather than the capital contribution method the total amount of such parentsubsidiary loans may not exceed  million which is the difference between taizhou fuling’s total investment amount as approved by the foreign investment authorities currently  million and taizhou fuling’s registered capital currently  million to the extent we are unable to receive all of the proceeds of this offering through a parentsubsidiary loan we would anticipate using such excess in our us operations but may at any time reallocate those of other funds via intercompany loans and contributions to our prc subsidiaries by contrast if we fund taizhou fuling through a capital contribution the amount of our contribution is subject to increasing our registered capital as described above and applying to change the approved investment amount is not required such parentsubsidiary loans must also be registered with the safe which registration usually takes no more than  working days after application to complete the cost for obtaining such approvals and completing such registration is minimal we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis if at all the procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this offering and we will be unable to use the funds in china until remittance is completed we have not yet initiated the process of remitting money to china using either method but will begin to do so promptly upon completion of this offering pending use of the net proceeds we intend to invest our net proceeds in shortterm interest bearing investmentgrade obligations these investments may have a material adverse effect on the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares it is possible that we may become a passive foreign investment company for us federal income taxpayers which could result in negative tax consequences to you the foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions but our management will have significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering the occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this prospectus the largest producers of foodservice disposables in the united states are significantly larger than our company a recent report by freedonia estimates that three companies control approximately  of the foodservice disposable market in the united states and the top ten companies accounted for approximately  of the market in  because the entire foodservice disposable market in the united states consists of packaging serviceware and napkins and other foodservice disposables — while we only compete in the serviceware segment — we occupy a relatively small competitive position in the market as a whole concentration in the foodservice disposables industry varies widely within specific market segments with some segments dominated by a small number of producers for example dart container is the leading supplier of plastic foodservice beverage cups followed by pactiv and berry plastics by contrast the market for cutlery is more fragmented with a growing portion of the market supplied by contract manufacturers in china among usbased suppliers of foodservice disposable cutlery are berry plastics dw fine pack dart container including solo cup georgiapacific maryland plastics pactiv and waddington group most of these firms offer a number of different cutlery lines and are diversified into the production of straws and other foodservice disposables in april  dw fine pack expanded its cutlery and straw offerings through its acquisition of jet plastica industries prior to the acquisition jet plastica claimed to be the largest manufacturer of straws in the us other suppliers of foodservice straws include cellocore earth straws new wincup pactiv via spirit foodservice rockline industries royer stalkmarket products and stone straw wentworth technologies our primary competitors are the following companies we have set forth our assessment of our companies’ relative strengths and challenges this table represents our belief about our competitive position and is based on our observations rather than objective data except the ranking the ranking is provided by the china chamber of commerce for import and export of light industrial products and arts and crafts regarding china’s plastic kitchenware and serviceware companies for exports our assessment may not be shared by others including such competitors but it does represent management’s assessment of our industry position moreover the below statements of industry are based on our current knowledge in our industry to the extent there are developments we have not learned about for instance if a competitor has licensing agreements with a founder rather
