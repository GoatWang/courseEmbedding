wouldn’t but what if it’s not the same the nasdaq  etf qqq fact sheet says it is filled with growth companies and only trades at x earnings the same as the sp  they don’t tell you that they exclude any companies with losses they don’t describe how they effectively eliminate the impact of companies with very pe ratios through a rather abstruse formula known as the weighted average harmonic mean in the absence of having an mba or statistical degree if you calculated the pe ratio of the nasdaq  the way you know how by simply averaging the pe ratios of the  profitable companies then the pe is over x it’s one thing to not know it’s another to be told what isn’t so as with every quarterly commentary we’ll review just how indexed products that purport to be low volatility or low risk or provide exposure to a given country or industry actually are not or do not you don’t get something for nothing particularly on wall street read more  st quarter  commentary april   conference call replay in past reviews we’ve titillated you with some of the more startling and storyworthy examples of the distortions caused by the indexation vortex we have chosen far flung examples in order to direct one’s attention through all the noise of conflicting information from the financial news media toward the bubble conditions that etfs have wrought but because those examples have been drawn from more marginal sectors on the market many of you might have wondered whether they are relevant to their portfolios so in this quarter’s letter we go mainstream to see what’s going on in the most basic portfolio building blocks the bread and butter asset classes first the sp  itself and then a typical mainstream growth fund and a mainstream value fund that an everyman or everywoman would use the kind of fund that is relevant read more  th quarter  commentary january   conference call replay this past year was interesting on so many more fronts than  and this coming year could be more interesting still in  the financial markets saw all sorts of records and precedents – and not in a good way we have been taking some time to prepare our client portfolios for advantage advantage hinges on the ability to make opportunistic investments to take what the market gives not what it doesn’t opportunism has a field of play when prices have declined sometimes they decline suddenly other times slowly sometimes the whole market together other times just pieces of it but entry to that field of opportunity itself hinges on having sufficient liquidity without liquidity the opportunities are just an idea of what might have been money flows into etfs and similar funds have not only pushed up the prices of the major indexcentric companies but also created an artificial downdraft among the thousands of nonindexation securities that is where the companies with less systemic risk will be found there will be more in the way of idiosyncratic investments with the opportunity for true optionality perhaps our portfolios will have to have fewer but more selective securities with perhaps larger weightings in those companies with truly discounted valuations and a truly superior business position so the watch words are preparedness and sobriety dr louis pasteur said “fortune favors the wellprepared mind” read more  more quarterly commentaries  market
