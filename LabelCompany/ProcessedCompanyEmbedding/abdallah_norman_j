executive to hit restaurantrich bethesda but norman j abdallah has his eyes on a distant market last month red hot concepts inc hired abdallah away from brinker international inc in dallas to expand red hots overseas property the chilis grill  bar restaurant chain based in bethesda abdallah had impeccable credentials for the job because he already had managed the launching of  chilis franchises abroad for brinker which controls the  restaurants in the chilis chain including  in the washington area red hot bought franchise development rights for chilis in britain australia and new zealand from brinker two years ago over the past two years in our relationship with brinkers norman has been the key person dealing with the international market said colin halpern red hots founder and chairman who vacated the position of president to make way for abdallah i decided that it was time to bring someone of normans background and experience in to help build the company abdallah  has been in the restaurant business for  years having begun as a boy in his familys soup and sandwich restaurant in waxahachie tex when his father turned down his request for wages he found a paying job at kbobs steakhouse where he worked during high school and college eventually rising to direct franchise operations and development abdallah joined brinker international in  as an assistant manager at a chilis in dallas after hearing founder norman brinker give a motivational speech brinker is a pioneer in the casualdining business he started the steak and ale chain in  and his company is one of the largest in the field in the united states operating five restaurant chains including the flagship chilis grill  bar a succession of brinker international jobs led to abdallahs promotion three years ago to vice president of franchise operations and development with oversight of the management of  franchise restaurants in the united states and  other countries at red hot abdallah will have to sell the idea of casual dining to consumers unfamiliar with americanstyle chains theres a pretty big gap between americans and the others abdallah said australians dine out an average of  times a week while britons venture into restaurants nearly three times a week americans meanwhile eat an average of five meals a week away from home the gap is closing gradually abdallah said adding that the key to winning over diners in foreign markets unused to casualdining restaurants will be to sell the core concept of the restaurant while adapting the overall theme to accommodate local interests and tastes before abdallahs arrival red hot concepts had opened three chilis units in britain and two more in australia a third chilis is scheduled to open this week in australia halpern said he expects to build  to  of the restaurants over the next five years in countries where red hot has exclusive rights dennis lombardi executive vice president of technomic inc a chicagobased restaurant consulting firm said us companies attempting to export the casual dining restaurant concept abroad need to pair up with wellestablished business partners in the host countries and cater to local cultural traditions you have to adapt to the local markets and pick good locations when you build franchises in overseas markets he said abdallahs challenge will be bringing profitability to twoyearold red hot as it exports the casualdining idea in  red hot concepts generated  million in revenue but suffered a loss of  million firstquarter  figures for the public company show revenue of  million with a loss of  the losses reflect company startup and development costs halpern said the restaurant business is a fairly capitalintensive business to build a restaurant in  live please help us narrow down your
