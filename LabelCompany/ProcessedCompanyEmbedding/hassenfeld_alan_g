acquired game maker cranium inc for  million the deal was announced on january  and closed on january  hasbro is collaborating with discovery communications on hub network a new cable network which

the talks were reported to have fallen through on july   the company announced the intent to sell its last two factories in ireland and east longmeadow massachusetts factories including its  manufacturing services to cartamundi which should close in sixty days hasbro signed a fiveyear deal with cartamundi to produce their board games at the east longmeadow plant with mattel adding two competing lines and other blunders and an expiration of the disney princess license at the end of  disney gave hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on star wars which led to a

accused hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in indonesia hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy earning the company praise from greenpeace executive director phil radford who said the new hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and forest stewardship council fsc certified paper in its toy packaging hasbros new commitments are great news for indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them there have also been criticisms of hasbro for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups for example in november  a letter from a sixyearold irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game guess who spread widely on social media and garnered attention in the press after the girls mother posted the exchange on her blog news reports criticized hasbros response as missing the point of the letter and not kidfriendly guess who has previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of  images hasbro primarily sells toys directed at either the girl or boy markets as such there have been criticisms that hasbros toys reinforce gender stereotypes for example in december  yearold mckenna pope started a campaign on changeorg calling on the company to create a boyfriendly version of the popular easybake oven and to feature boys on their packaging and materials within a week over  people signed her petition hasbro was criticized for sexist product design when its  star wars monopoly board game failed to feature rey the female protagonist in star wars the force awakens while nonetheless including all of the supporting male characters on january   hasbro announced that rey would be included in future versions  but only after much criticism this move perplexed even the movies director j j abrams who reportedly said i read that rey wasn’t in the monopoly game and was quickly making phone calls about this because if it were true  and it is true and now hasbro of course has said they’re going to put rey in—it doesn’t quite make sense why she wouldn’t be there she’s somewhat important in the story on october   lorraine markham sued hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her she is seeking a declaration from the us district court in providence that her husband bill markham was the sole creator of the game of life manufactureedit over the years hasbro has outsourced the manufacture of its products to thirdparty companies mostly in china at the chinese factories which hasbro does not directly own or operate

became president the company entered the plastic fields during world war ii to support its toy line hassenfeld brothers first toy hit was mr potato head which the company purchased from george lerner in  the toy was a smash success in  the company became a disney major licensee in  henry died and merrill took over the parent company and his older brother harold ran the pencilmaking business empire pencil hassenfeld brothers expanded to canada with hassenfeld brothers canada ltd in  the company was approached in  to license a toy based on the lieutenant which they turned down because they did not want to be tied to a possibly shortlived television series instead in  hassenfeld brothers produced the gi joe toy which they termed an action figure in order to market the toy to boys who wouldnt want to play with dolls in  and  gi joe accounted for twothirds of hassenfelds sales hasbro industriesedit having previously sold toys under the hasbro trade name the company shortened its name to hasbro industries in  and sold a minor stake in the corporation to the public with the unpopular vietnam war at its height in  hasbro redesigned gi joe to be less militaristic and more adventure

mixed results due to cash flow problems from increasing the number of toys in the line to offset gi joes declining sales in  the gi joe line was ended by hasbro caused by the rising price of plastic via its raw material and crude oils increasing prices in  hasbros losses were  million and the company held a large debt load that same year hasbro acquired peanuts cartoon characters licensing rights with the financial situation poor hasbros bankers made the company temporarily stop dividend payments in early  the toy divisions losses increased harold hassenfelds resentment regarding the companys treatment of the empire pencil subsidiary as empire received lower levels of capital spending to profits than did the toy division with merrills death in  harold did not recognize stephens authority as the successor to the chairman  ceo position as a solution hasbro spun off empire pencil in  then the nations largest pencil maker with harold trading his hasbro shares for those of empire stephen then became both the ceo and chairman of the board between  and  stephen reduced the hasbro product line by onethird and its new products by onehalf hasbro focused on simple low cost longer life cycle toys like mr potato head hasbro thus stayed out of the electronic games field which went bust in the early s in  hasbro revived its gi joe line—with the help of marvel comics—as an antiterrorist commando based on current events the company launched the successful transformers toy line along with a childrens animated tv series two years later with the toys and tv series being popular stephen

largest toy company hasbro then moved to outsell mattels barbie in the fashion doll market with the  introduction of jem a record producerrock musician dual identity fashion doll initially posting strong sales jem plummeted and was withdrawn from the market in  hasbro followed up in  with maxie a barbiesized blonde doll so barbie clothing and accessories would fit maxie lasted until  under alans initiative in the late s hasbro moved to increase international sales by taking us market failed toys overseas and selling them for as much as four times the original price this increased international sales from  million in  to  million in  in  hasbro purchased part of coleco industries indoor and outdoor childrens furniture and rideon toy product lines for  million including two just closed manufacturing plants in amsterdam ny in july  hasbro acquired bankrupt coleco for  million stephen hassenfeld died later that year with the company having gone from sales of  million in the

market in which to expand in  hasbro purchased nomura toys ltd in japan and majority ownership of palmyra a southeast asian toy distributor these increased the proportion of international sales from  in  to   billion in  in  hasbro lost its bid for j w spear  sons a ukbased game maker to mattel in the us hasbros growth since  were from acquisitions and the leveraging of the new assets new product development was not as successful except for movie and tv tiein product lines with jurassic park and barney thus us sales were stagnant in the early s falling from  to  to turn domestic performance around in  hasbro merged the hasbro toy playskool playskool baby kenner and kid dimension units into the hasbro toy group meanwhile mattel purchased fisherprice and retook the top spot in the toy industry hasbro interactive was started in  and released the monopoly game on cdrom mattel also proposed a merger that year but was turned down by the hasbro board in  due to antitrust issues and justice department investigation into exclusionary policies between toy manufacturers and toy retailers particularly toys r us in  hasbro bought avalon hill for  million and in  wizards of the coast was bought in a deal worth  million wizards of the coast is now a subsidiary of hasbro and has avalon hill as its division in  moneylosing hasbro interactive was sold to infogrames a french software concern for  million hasbro entered the building block toy with its built to rule line in  which did not hold together well or were too hard for the targeted age group thus ended in  in  a workers rights group investigated several of hasbros chinese suppliers and found that in one instance a toy factory in chinas guangxi province had hired  junior high school students the same group discovered other widespread labor violations including unsafe working conditions mandatory overtime verbal abuse and sexual harassment of employees hasbro issued a statement saying that it would act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes and had increased the intensity of its ongoing safety review efforts critics pointed out that hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors these auditors make unannounced visits to the east asian subcontractors factory managers have been coached in how to fool the auditors in  hasbro acquired game maker cranium inc for  million the deal was announced on january  and closed on january  hasbro is collaborating with discovery communications on hub network a new cable network which began on october   the venture proved successful in unexpected ways when the tv revival of the my little pony franchise my little pony friendship is magic became the networks highestrated program with not only its target demographic of young girls but attracted an unexpectedly significant cult following among teens and adults the hub network was rebranded as discovery family on october   hasbro also produces marvel comics and star wars toys having recently renewed this deal through at least  hasbro by april  started up its  manufacturing services a contract oem game manufacturing operating

amounting to  of its salaried employees meanwhile ceo brian goldner signed a new fiveyear contract as of fiscal year  ceo brian goldner had a total calculated compensation of  in july  backflip studios sold a  stake in the company to hasbro for  million in cash on november   it was reported that hasbro was in talks to buy dreamworks animation the proposal reportedly calls for the combined company to take the name dreamworkshasbro and for jeffrey katzenberg to become its chairman but as a matter of policy neither hasbro nor dwa publicly comment on mergers and acquisitions two days later the talks were reported to have fallen through on july   the company announced the intent to sell its last two factories in ireland and east longmeadow massachusetts factories including its  manufacturing services to cartamundi which should close in sixty days hasbro signed a fiveyear deal with cartamundi to produce their board games at the east longmeadow plant with mattel adding two competing lines and other blunders and an expiration of the disney princess license at the end of  disney gave hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on star wars which led to a descendants license dcp was also attempting to evolve the brand from one of them less as damsels and more as heroines in september  disney announced that hasbro would be the licensed doll maker for the disney princess line starting on january   in july  hasbro acquired dublinbased boulder media limited and placed it under the control of its chief content officer hasbro announced that it would launch its own convention named hascon and featuring all things hasbro in  with the inaugural event being held at the rhode island convention center in september  controversyedit in  greenpeace accused hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in indonesia hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy earning the company praise from greenpeace executive director phil radford who said the new hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and forest stewardship council fsc certified paper in its toy packaging hasbros new commitments are great news for indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them there have also been criticisms of hasbro for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups for example in november  a letter from a sixyearold irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game guess who spread widely on social media and garnered attention in the press after the girls mother posted the exchange on her blog news reports criticized hasbros response as missing the point of the letter and not kidfriendly guess who has previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of  images hasbro primarily sells toys directed at either the girl or boy markets as such there have been criticisms that hasbros toys reinforce gender stereotypes for example in december  yearold mckenna pope started a campaign on changeorg calling on the company to create a boyfriendly version of the popular easybake oven and to feature boys on their packaging and materials within a week over  people signed her petition hasbro was criticized for sexist product design when its  star wars monopoly board game failed to feature rey the female protagonist in star wars the force awakens while nonetheless including all of the supporting male characters on january   hasbro announced that rey would be included in future versions  but only after much criticism this move perplexed even the movies director j j abrams who reportedly said i read that rey wasn’t in the monopoly game and was quickly making phone calls about this because if it were true  and it is true and now hasbro of course has said they’re going to put rey in—it doesn’t quite make sense why she wouldn’t be there she’s somewhat important in the story on october   lorraine markham sued hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her she is seeking a declaration from the us district court in providence that her husband bill markham was the sole creator of the game of life manufactureedit over the years hasbro has outsourced the manufacture of its products to thirdparty companies mostly in china at the chinese factories which hasbro does not directly own or operate migrant workers are compensated with meagre salaries for their labor at one such factory in dongguan china basic assembly line jobs pay a little over one hundred us dollars per month chinas minimum wage a report released by china labor watch in  revealed numerous abuses at hasbros chinese supplier companies including labor contract violations excessive and illegal overtime poor living conditions environmental pollution and more the report was investigated by a congressional hearing in december  outside asia hasbro owns and operates only two manufacturing facilities one in waterford ireland the other in east longmeadow massachusetts usa in recent years the company has cut jobs at both plants in response to increasing competition from lower cost locations in china at the end of  for example hasbros irish division laid off more than one third of its workforce quality controledit to ensure that their electronic devices are at high quality standards hasbro and other toy companies add a test mode to the electronic device which allows the manufacturing team and all parts of hasbro to make sure that all the sounds are present the moving parts and lights are working and that the electronic device powers off normally sometimes the hidden modes are removed from the game in the final product but most of modern games from  onwards can be accessed by a consumer the games instructions mentions nothing about these hidden modes and hasbro do not share details on how to get to their own manufacturer mode as they have said that giving test mode instructions to a consumer considered to be proprietary impactedit hasbro was named by fortune magazine as one of the top  companies to work for in  citing that the company enhanced its vacation policy by giving new employees

other widespread labor violations including unsafe working conditions mandatory overtime verbal abuse and sexual harassment of employees hasbro issued a statement saying that it would act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes and had increased the intensity of its ongoing safety review efforts critics pointed out that hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors these auditors make unannounced visits to the east asian subcontractors factory managers have been coached in how to fool the auditors in  hasbro acquired game maker cranium inc for  million the deal was announced on january  and closed on january  hasbro is collaborating with discovery communications on hub network a new cable network which began on october   the venture proved successful in unexpected ways when the tv revival of the my little pony franchise my little pony friendship is magic became the networks highestrated program with not only its target demographic of young girls but attracted an unexpectedly significant cult following among teens and adults the hub network was rebranded as discovery family on october   hasbro

the talks were reported to have fallen through on july   the company announced the intent to sell its last two factories in ireland and east longmeadow massachusetts factories including its  manufacturing services to cartamundi which should close in sixty days hasbro signed a fiveyear deal with cartamundi to produce their board games at the east longmeadow plant with mattel adding two competing lines and other blunders and an expiration of the disney princess license at the end of  disney gave hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on star wars which led to a descendants license dcp was also attempting to evolve the brand from one of them less as damsels and more as heroines in september  disney announced that hasbro would be the licensed doll maker for the disney princess line starting on january   in july  hasbro acquired dublinbased boulder media limited and placed it under the control of its chief content officer hasbro announced that it would launch its own convention named hascon and featuring all things hasbro in  with the inaugural event being held at the rhode island convention center in september  controversyedit in  greenpeace accused hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in indonesia hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy earning the company praise from greenpeace executive director phil radford who said the new hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and forest stewardship council fsc certified paper in its toy packaging hasbros new commitments are great news for indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them there have also been criticisms of hasbro for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups for example in november  a letter from a sixyearold irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game guess who spread widely on social media and garnered attention in the press after the girls mother posted the exchange on her blog news reports criticized hasbros response as missing the point of the letter and not kidfriendly guess who has previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of  images hasbro primarily sells toys directed at either the girl or boy markets as such there have been criticisms that hasbros toys reinforce gender stereotypes for example in december  yearold mckenna pope started a campaign on changeorg calling on the company to create a boyfriendly version of the popular easybake oven and to feature boys on their packaging and materials within a week over  people signed her petition hasbro was criticized for sexist product design when its  star wars monopoly board game failed to feature rey the female protagonist in star wars the force awakens while nonetheless including all of the supporting male characters on january   hasbro announced that rey would be included in future versions  but only after much criticism this move perplexed even the movies director j j abrams who reportedly said i read that rey wasn’t in the monopoly game and was quickly making phone calls about this because if it were true  and it is true and now hasbro of course has said they’re going to put rey in—it doesn’t quite make sense why she wouldn’t be there she’s somewhat important in the story on october   lorraine markham sued hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her she is seeking a declaration from the us district court in providence that her husband bill markham was the sole creator of the game of life manufactureedit over the years hasbro has outsourced the manufacture of its products to thirdparty companies mostly in china at the chinese factories which hasbro does not directly own or operate migrant workers are compensated with meagre salaries for their labor at one such factory in dongguan china basic assembly line jobs pay a little over one hundred us dollars per month chinas minimum wage a report released by china labor watch in  revealed numerous abuses at hasbros chinese supplier companies including labor contract violations excessive and illegal overtime poor living conditions environmental pollution and more the report was investigated by a congressional hearing in december  outside asia hasbro owns and operates only two manufacturing facilities one in waterford ireland the other in east longmeadow massachusetts usa in recent years the company has cut jobs at both plants in response to increasing competition from lower cost locations in china at the end of  for example hasbros irish division laid off more than one third of its workforce quality controledit to ensure that their electronic devices are at high quality standards hasbro and other toy companies add a test mode to the electronic device which allows the manufacturing team and all parts of hasbro to make sure that all the sounds are present the moving parts and lights are working and that the electronic device powers off normally sometimes the hidden modes are removed from the game in the final product but most of modern games from  onwards can be accessed by a consumer the games instructions mentions nothing about these hidden modes and hasbro do not share details on how to get to their own manufacturer mode as they have said that giving test mode instructions to a consumer

other widespread labor violations including unsafe working conditions mandatory overtime verbal abuse and sexual harassment of employees hasbro issued a statement saying that it would act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes and had increased the intensity of its ongoing safety review efforts critics pointed out that hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors these auditors make unannounced visits to the east asian subcontractors factory managers have been coached in how to fool the auditors in  hasbro acquired game maker cranium inc for  million the deal was announced on january  and closed on january  hasbro is collaborating with discovery communications on hub network a new cable network which began on october   the venture proved successful in unexpected ways when the tv revival of the my little pony franchise my little pony friendship is magic became the networks highestrated program with not only its target demographic of young girls but attracted an unexpectedly significant cult following among teens and adults the hub network was rebranded as discovery family on october   hasbro

studios sold a  stake in the company to hasbro for  million in cash on november   it was reported that hasbro was in talks to buy dreamworks animation the proposal reportedly calls for the combined

the talks were reported to have fallen through on july   the company announced the intent to sell its last two factories in ireland and east longmeadow massachusetts factories including its  manufacturing services to cartamundi which should close in sixty days hasbro signed a fiveyear deal with cartamundi to produce their board games at the east longmeadow plant with mattel adding two competing lines and other blunders and an expiration of the disney princess license at the end of  disney gave hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on star wars which led to a descendants license dcp was also attempting to evolve the brand from one of them less as damsels and more as heroines in september  disney announced that hasbro would be the licensed doll maker for the disney princess line starting on january   in july  hasbro acquired dublinbased boulder media limited and placed it under the control of its chief content officer hasbro announced that it would launch its own convention named hascon and featuring all things hasbro in  with the inaugural event being held at the rhode island convention center in september  controversyedit in  greenpeace accused hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in indonesia hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy earning the company praise from greenpeace executive director phil radford who said the new hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and forest stewardship council fsc certified paper in its toy packaging hasbros new commitments are great news for indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them there have also been criticisms of hasbro for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups for example in november  a letter from a sixyearold irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game guess who spread widely on social media and garnered attention in the press after the girls mother posted the exchange on her blog news reports criticized hasbros response as missing the point of the letter and not kidfriendly guess who has previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of  images hasbro primarily sells toys directed at either the girl or boy markets as such there have been criticisms that hasbros toys reinforce gender stereotypes for example in december  yearold mckenna pope started a campaign on changeorg calling on the company to create a boyfriendly version of the popular easybake oven and to feature boys on their packaging and materials within a week over  people signed her petition hasbro was criticized for sexist product design when its  star wars monopoly board game failed to feature rey the female protagonist in star wars the force awakens while nonetheless including all of the supporting male characters on january   hasbro announced that rey would be included in future versions  but only after much criticism this move perplexed even the movies director j j abrams who reportedly said i read that rey wasn’t in the monopoly game and was quickly making phone calls about this because if it were true  and it is true and now hasbro of course has said they’re going to put rey in—it doesn’t quite make sense why she wouldn’t be there she’s somewhat important in the story on october   lorraine markham sued hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her she is seeking a declaration from the us district court in providence that her husband bill markham was the sole creator of the game of life manufactureedit over the years hasbro has outsourced the manufacture of its products to thirdparty companies mostly in china at the chinese factories which hasbro does not directly own or operate migrant workers are compensated with meagre salaries for their labor at one such factory in dongguan china basic assembly line jobs pay a little over one hundred us dollars per month chinas minimum wage a report released by china labor watch in  revealed numerous abuses at hasbros chinese supplier companies including labor contract violations excessive and illegal overtime poor living conditions environmental pollution and more the report was investigated by a congressional hearing in december  outside asia hasbro owns and operates only two manufacturing facilities one in waterford ireland the other in east longmeadow massachusetts usa in recent years the company has cut jobs at both plants in response to increasing competition from lower cost locations in china at the end of  for example hasbros irish division laid off more than one third of its workforce quality controledit to ensure that their electronic devices are at high quality standards hasbro and other toy companies add a test mode to the electronic device which allows the manufacturing team and all parts of hasbro to make sure that all the sounds are present the moving parts and lights are working and that the electronic device powers off normally sometimes the hidden modes are removed from the game in the final product but most of modern games from  onwards can be accessed by a consumer the games instructions mentions nothing about these hidden modes and hasbro do not share details on how to get to their own manufacturer mode as they have said that giving test mode instructions to a consumer considered to be proprietary impactedit hasbro was named by fortune magazine as one of the top  companies to work for in  citing that the company enhanced its vacation policy by giving new employees

acquired game maker cranium inc for  million the deal was announced on january  and closed on january  hasbro is collaborating with discovery communications on hub network a new cable network which began on october   the venture proved successful in unexpected ways when the tv revival of the my little pony franchise my little pony friendship is magic became the networks highestrated program with

the talks were reported to have fallen through on july   the company announced the intent to sell its last two factories in ireland and east longmeadow massachusetts factories including its  manufacturing services to cartamundi which should close in sixty days hasbro signed a fiveyear deal with cartamundi to produce their board games at the east longmeadow plant with mattel adding two competing lines and other blunders and an expiration of the disney princess license at the end of  disney gave hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on star wars which led to a descendants license dcp was also attempting to evolve the brand from one of them less as damsels and more as heroines in september  disney announced that hasbro would be the licensed doll maker for the disney princess line starting on january   in july  hasbro acquired dublinbased boulder media limited and placed it under the control of its chief content officer hasbro announced that it would launch its own convention named hascon and featuring all things hasbro in  with the inaugural event being held at the rhode island convention center in september  controversyedit in  greenpeace accused hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in indonesia hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy earning the company praise from greenpeace executive director phil radford who said the new hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and forest stewardship council fsc certified paper in its toy packaging hasbros new commitments are great news for indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them there have also been criticisms of hasbro for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups for example in november  a letter from a sixyearold irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game guess who spread widely on social media and garnered attention in the press after the girls mother posted the exchange on her blog news reports criticized hasbros response as missing the point of the letter and not kidfriendly guess who has previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of  images hasbro primarily sells toys directed at either the girl or boy markets as such there have been criticisms that hasbros toys reinforce gender stereotypes for example in december  yearold mckenna pope started a campaign on changeorg calling on the company to create a boyfriendly version of the popular easybake oven and to feature boys on their packaging and materials within a week over  people signed her petition hasbro was criticized for sexist product design when its  star wars monopoly board game failed to feature rey the female protagonist in star wars the force awakens while nonetheless including all of the supporting male characters on january   hasbro announced that rey would be included in future versions  but only after much criticism this move perplexed even the movies director j j abrams who reportedly said i read that rey wasn’t in the monopoly game and was quickly making phone calls about this because if it were true  and it is true and now hasbro of course has said they’re going to put rey in—it doesn’t quite make sense why she wouldn’t be there she’s somewhat important in the story on october   lorraine markham sued hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her she is seeking a declaration from the us district court in providence that her husband bill markham was the sole creator of the game of life manufactureedit over the years hasbro has outsourced the manufacture of its products to thirdparty companies mostly in china at the chinese factories which hasbro does not directly own or operate migrant workers are compensated with meagre salaries for their labor at one such factory in dongguan china basic assembly line jobs pay a little over one hundred us dollars per month chinas minimum wage a report released by china labor watch in  revealed numerous abuses at hasbros chinese supplier companies including labor contract violations excessive and illegal overtime poor living conditions environmental pollution and more the report was investigated by a congressional hearing in december  outside asia hasbro owns and operates only two manufacturing facilities one in waterford ireland the other in east longmeadow massachusetts usa in recent years the company has cut jobs at both plants in response to increasing competition from lower cost locations in china at the end of  for example hasbros irish division laid off more than one third of its workforce quality controledit to ensure that their electronic devices are at high quality standards hasbro and other toy companies add a test mode to the electronic device which allows the manufacturing team and all parts of hasbro to make sure that all the sounds are present the moving parts and lights are working and that the electronic device powers off normally sometimes the hidden modes are removed from the game in the final product but most of modern games from  onwards can be accessed by a consumer the games instructions mentions nothing about these hidden modes and hasbro do not share details on how to get to their own manufacturer mode as they have said that giving test mode instructions to a consumer
