information included on our website is not incorporated by reference herein nongaap financial measures to supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we use the following nongaap measures of financial performance adjusted ebitda which represents net income loss plus interest expense provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization the amortization of the stepup to fair value of merchandise inventory resulting from the application of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the acquisition certain acquisitionrelated expenses sponsor fees equitybased compensation expense writeoff of property and equipment prior period adjustment for tenant allowances and other nonrecurring expenses primarily consisting of outside legal and professional fees associated with certain nonrecurring transactions and events we present adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis because our management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance and we believe that it is helpful to investors securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period we also use adjusted ebitda as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations further we recognize adjusted ebitda as a commonly used measure in determining business value and as such use it internally to report results adjusted net income which represents net income loss plus prior period adjustment for tenant allowances and other nonrecurring expenses primarily consisting of outside legal and professional fees associated with certain nonrecurring transactions and events we present adjusted net income on a consolidated basis because our management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance and we believe that it is helpful to investors securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period adjusted earnings per share “adjusted eps” which represents adjusted net income divided by the number of shares outstanding adjusted eps is presented as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance and we believe that it is helpful to investors securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period while we believe that adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps are useful in evaluating our business adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that have limitations as analytical tools adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps should not be considered alternatives to or substitutes for net income loss or eps which are calculated in accordance with gaap in addition other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps differently or not at all which reduces the usefulness of adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps as tools for comparison we recommend that you review the reconciliation and calculation of adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted eps to net income loss and eps the most directly comparable gaap financial measures under “reconciliation of gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income” and not rely solely on adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted eps or any single financial measure to evaluate our business forwardlooking statements this press release contains and oral statements made from time to

fiscal year generally is comprised of four week fiscal quarters although in the years with  weeks the fourth quarter represents a week period fiscal year  pro forma fiscal year  and fiscal year  ended on january   january   and january   respectively and were each comprised of  weeks overview jjill is a nationally recognized womens apparel brand focused on a loyal engaged and affluent customer in the attractive  age segment the jjill brand represents an easy relaxed and inspired style that reflects the confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich full life we operate a highly profitable omnichannel platform that is well diversified across our direct  of net sales for fiscal year  and retail  of net sales for fiscal year  channels we began as a catalog company and have been a pioneer of the omnichannel model with a compelling presence across stores website and catalog since  we have developed an industryleading customer database that allows us to match approximately  of transactions to an identifiable customer we take a datacentric approach in which we leverage our database and apply our insights to manage our business as well as to acquire and engage customers to drive optimum value and productivity our goals are to create a great brand to build a successful business and to make jjill a great place to work to achieve this we have aligned our strategy and team around four guiding pillarsbrand customer product and channel factors affecting our operating results various factors are expected to continue to affect our results of operations going forward including the following overall economic trends consumer purchases of clothing and other merchandise generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods when disposable income is adversely affected and consequently our results of operations may be affected by general economic conditions for example reduced consumer confidence and lower availability and higher cost of consumer credit may reduce demand for our merchandise and may limit our ability to increase or sustain prices the growth rate of the market could be affected by macroeconomic conditions in the united states consumer preferences and fashion trends our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to anticipate fashion trends during periods in which we have successfully anticipated fashion trends we have generally had more favorable results competition the retail industry is highly competitive and retailers compete based on a variety of factors including design quality price and customer service levels of competition and the ability of our competitors to more accurately predict fashion trends and otherwise attract customers through competitive pricing or other factors may impact our results of operations our strategic initiatives we are in the process of implementing significant business initiatives that have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations including our brand voice and customer table of contents segmentation initiatives although these initiatives are designed to create growth in our business and continuing improvement in our operating results the timing of expenditures related to these initiatives as well as the achievement of returns on our investments may affect our results of operation in future periods pricing and changes in our merchandise mix our product offering changes from period to period as do the prices at which goods are sold and the margins we are able to earn from the sales of those goods the levels at which we are able to price our merchandise are influenced by a variety of factors including the quality of our products cost of production prices at which our competitors are selling similar products and the willingness of our customers to pay for products how we assess the performance of our business in assessing the performance of our business we consider a variety of financial and operating metrics including gaap and nongaap measures including the following net sales consists primarily of revenues net of merchandise returns and discounts generated from the sale of apparel and accessory merchandise through our direct channel and retail channel net sales also include shipping and handling fees collected from customers revenue from our retail channel is recognized at the time of sale and revenue from our direct channel is recognized upon receipt of merchandise by the customer net sales are impacted by the size of our active customer base product assortment and availability marketing and promotional activities and the spending habits of our customers net sales are also impacted by the migration of singlechannel customers to omnichannel customers who on average spend nearly three times more than singlechannel customers total company comparable sales includes net sales from our fullprice stores that have been open for more than  weeks and from our direct channel this measure highlights the performance of existing stores open during the period while excluding the impact of new store openings and closures when a store in the total company comparable store base is temporarily closed for remodeling or other reasons it is included in total company comparable sales only using the full weeks it was open certain of our competitors and other retailers may calculate total company comparable sales differently than we do as a result the reporting of our total company comparable sales may not be comparable to sales data made available by other companies number of stores reflects all stores open at the end of a reporting period in connection with opening new stores we incur preopening costs preopening costs include expenses incurred prior to opening a new store and primarily consist of payroll travel training marketing initial opening supplies and costs of transporting initial inventory and fixtures to store locations as well as occupancy costs incurred from the time of possession of a store site to the opening of that store these preopening costs are included in selling general and administrative expenses and are generally incurred and expensed within  days of opening a new store gross profit is equal to our net sales less costs of goods sold gross profit as a percentage of our net sales is referred to as gross margin costs of goods sold includes the direct costs of sold merchandise inventory shrinkage and adjustments and reserves for excess aged and obsolete inventory we review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis to identify slowmoving merchandise and use product markdowns to efficiently sell these products changes in the assortment of our products may also impact our gross profit the timing and level of markdowns are driven by customer acceptance of our merchandise certain of our competitors and other retailers may report costs of goods sold differently than we do as a result the reporting of our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to other companies the primary drivers of the costs of goods sold are raw materials which fluctuate based on certain factors beyond our control including labor conditions transportation or freight costs energy prices currency fluctuations and commodity prices we place orders with merchandise suppliers in united states dollars and as a result are not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange risk table of contents selling general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in costs of goods sold these expenses include all payroll and related expenses occupancy costs and other operating expenses related to our stores and to our operations at our headquarters including utilities depreciation and amortization these expenses also include marketing expense including catalog production and mailing costs warehousing distribution and shipping costs customer service operations consulting and software services professional services and other administrative costs our historical revenue growth has been accompanied by increased selling general and administrative expenses the most significant increases were in occupancy costs associated with retail store expansion and in marketing and payroll investments while we expect these expenses to increase as we continue to open new stores increase brand awareness and grow our business we believe these expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales over time as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we expect that compliance with the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly in addition we expect that our management and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to these public company requirements in particular we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act in that regard we expect to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda represents net income loss plus interest expense provision benefit for income taxes
