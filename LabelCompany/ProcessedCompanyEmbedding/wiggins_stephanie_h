and page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  i i nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  resource america inc resource america for unjust enrichment resource capital is a real estate investment trust reit that is externally managed by resource manager an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of resource america an asset management company neither the company nor resource manager has any exclusively dedicated employees rather all of resource capitals and resource managers officers portfolio managers administrative personnel and other employees are employees of resource america until september   defendants edward cohen and jonathan cohen collectively the cohens were resource americas largest stockholders beneficially owning approximately  of its shares although the cohens are now retired from resource capitals board of directors they still allegedly control the company through their appointment of the current board members who are all allegedly loyal to and dependent upon them plaintiffs contend that resource america and resource manager which are both allegedly dominated by the cohens have significant discretion as to the implementation ofresource capitals operating policies and investment strategies the actions allege that the cohens and certain other defendants engaged in a course of conduct designed to enrich resource america at resource capitals expense through excessive and undeserved management fees first the board agreed to pay page  of  i  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  resource manager a monthly base management fee equal to onetwelfth of the companys equity regardless of performance second the board conceald for years that one of the companys mezzanine loan positions which it acquired in  the mezzanine loan was largely supported by a portfolio ofluxury brand hotels located in or near puerto rico third the board repeatedly caused or allowed the company to improperly brag that all of the companfs commercial real estate loans were performing for years during the collapse ofthe puerto rican economy continuing long after the mezzanine loan stopped performing in  plaintiffs allege that the defendants wrongful course of conduct improperly inflated the companys apparent equity from late  through the first half of  i  in turn improperly inflating the  management fees the company pad to resource manager during that time to an average of approximately   million per year on august   after tjie stock market closed resource capital issued a  f press release announcing its financial

quarterly net loss of  million due primarily to a  million loan loss on the mezzanine loan as disclosed in the press release major disruptions in puerto ricos economy caused the company to determine that the mezzanine loan should have been fully page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  reserved as a consequence of this disclosure resource capitals stock fell  eradicating over  million in market capitalization had the company timely recorded the loss in late  when the mezzanine loan stopped performing a similar decline in equity would presumably have occurred then causing resource capital to pay far less in management fees from the fourth quarter of  through the first quarter of  plaintiffs allege that resource capitals directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties by  misrepresenting and causing the company to misrepresent to the investing public the risk of the conipanys commercial loans portfolio its process and controls for assessing the quality and value of that portfolio  by failing to maintain for the company adequate internal and financial controls  by failing to disclose and causing the company to fail to disclose

tenenbaum  add   d dept   see also one beacon am ins co v colgatepalolive co  add   st dept      the duplication of effort waste of judicial resources and possibility of inconsistent rulings in the absence of a stay outweigh any prejudice to plaintiff resulting from the stay a stay is appropriate even where there is not complete identity of parties and claims where there is a common question of law and fact uptown healthcare mgt inc v rivkin radler llp  add  lt dept  belopolsky v renew data corp · add  st dept  under appropriate circumstances including the existence of an identity of issues and parties an action in state court may be stayed where there is another action pending in federal court certain underwriters at lloyds london v pneumo abex corp  add  st dept  in such a situation the issuance of a stay is not a matter of right rather it is a matter qf comity orderly procedure and judicial page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  discretion general aniline  film corp v bayer co  ny    additionally a stay may be granted even though defendants have not yet interposed answers see britt  add at  finally in determining whether to issue a stay a court may consider multiple additional factors plaintiffs first contention is that they will be unduly prejudiced if the court grants a stay specifically plaintiffs contend that the federal lawsuits are weaker than the complaint filed in the reaves action because at the time the federal derivative lawsuits were filed two of the most culpable defendants edward cohen and jonathan  i cohen were already off the resource capital board emphasizing that demand futility is assessed as to the directors on the board when the action is filed the reaves action was the only action that placed real litigation pressure on defendants  and the only  action capable of doing so  by alleging demand futility upon a board that included the most culpable defendants on the board the cohens accordingly as the reaves action is the action least susceptible to dismissal of all the derivative actions defendants moved to stay the reaves action in favor of the substantively weaker federal derivative  these factors include whether it is in the state or in the federal forum that a more complete disposition of issues may be obtained whether it is the federal or the state court that possesses a greater familiarity with the trial of such issues whether the federal action was commenced first and discovery has been completed whether the defendants in the actions are the same whether there is substantial overlap between the issues raised in the two proceedings whether a stay will avoid duplication of effort and waste of judicial resources whether a stay will avoid the risk of inconsistent rulings and whether plaintiffs have demonstrated how they would be prejudiced by a stay asher  add at  page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  lawsuits for the primary purpose of gaining an insurmountable tactical advantage over plaintiffs there is no new york case law explicitly stating that this court must compare the federal action to the state action on the merits to make a preliminary determination as to which party is more likely to prevail the cases cited above do not list it as a factor to consider on an application for a stay therefore this court will not consider the merits of each action in making its determination plaintiffs second contention is that the claims under section a of the federal exchange act in the federal derivative lawsuits are meritless and do not broaden the federal lawsuits specifically plaintiffs assert that federal courts routinely dismiss proxy fraud claims under section a of the exchange act on the grounds that stockholders may assert meritless a claims for the sole purpose of invoking federal jurisdiction galefv alexander  fd   n d cir  accordingly plaintiffs contend that there is a strong inference that the federal derivative lawsuits tacked on meritless section a claims to fabricate federal jurisdiction and do not broaden the federal derivative suits plaintiffs are engaging in hyperbole in asserting that the proxy fraud claims are patently meritless the genesis of plaintiffs assertion is a footnote in galef supra however plaintiffs fail to quote the entire footnote which states in its entirety  of  page  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  we recognize the possibility that stockholders may assert meritless s a claims for the sole purpose of invoking federal jurisdiction but this risk should be lessened by fedrcivp  which requires that the pleading of a party represented by counsel be signed by· at least one attorney in his individual name and which further provides the signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading· tht to the best of his knowledge information and belief there is good ground to support it and that it is not interposed for delay  for a wilful violation of this rule an attorney may be subjected to appropriate disciplinary action galef  fd at  footnote  on this record there is no reasonable basis for the court to assume that the federal proxy fraud claims are meritless and that th section a claims do not broaden the federal suits in addition to the claims asserted in the state cases the federal shareholder erivative actions involve a proxy fraud claim under section a ofthe exchange act the federal court has exclusive jurisdiction over·such claims see  usc section aa accordingly as the federal court is the only court that has jurisdiction over every claim asserted by the derivative plaintiffs the federal court can provide a mqre complete disposition of the claims at issue see barron v bluhdorn  add   pt dept  theatre confections inc v andrea heaters inc  add   th dept  action stayed as federal court had exclusive jurisdiction over issue involving federal antitrustlaws chan v zoullas miscd page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  a sup ct ny cnty  at  stay proper where the decision in one action will determine all the questions in the other action or will at least reduce the issues in the other action el greco inc v cohn  add  d dept  staying action where the record discloses that a more complete disposition of the parties respective contentions can be obtained in the earliercommenced federal action plaintiffs third contention is that the reaves action was filed in this court  before any of the federal derivative lawsuits as this court wasthe first which has taken jurisdiction new yorks firstfiled doctrine dictates that this court is the one in which the matter should be determined and it is a violation of the rules of comity to interfere in re perceptron inc vogelsong  add  th dept  vogelsong involved a proceeding to vacate an arbitration award and to enjoin an action brought in michigan to enforce the award accordingly it is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter however the firstfiled rule which gives precedence to the court in which an action is first commenced should not be mechanically applied ace fire underwriters ins co v itt industries inc  add   st dept  ratherthe court may look to factors outside of the firstfiled rule in making its determination as to whether this court should grant a stay see generally in re nyse euronext page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  shareholdersice litigation  miscd   sup ct ny cnty mar   as discussed supra the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction under section a of the exchange act therefore the federal courts can provide a more complete disposition of the claims at issue this factual determination weighs heavily in favor of issuing a stay in this proceeding plaintiffs fourth contention is that the determination of whether demand was futile as to a majority of the poard will necessarily require different analyses in the state and federal actions at the tie the first derivative action was filed in state court resource capitals board consisted of ten defendant directors the cohens kessler beach hart ickowicz levin neff fore and wiggins however at the time the first  derivative action was filed in federal court resource capitals board consisted of nine directors kessler levin neff beach hart ickowicz fore wiggins and nondefendant directors andrew l farkas and jeffrey p cohen as there is no case law stating this court must weigh the relative merits of the federal action and the state action as a factor in determining whether to impose a stay this curt will not deny a stay based upon the substantive merits of each action plaintiffs final contetion is that a stay may not be granted until both the state derivative lawsuits and the federal derivative lawsuits are fully at issue plaintiffs assert that until both actions are fully at issue it is impossible to say that apage of  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  determination in one action will dispose of the other the court has the discretion to grant a stay even when issue is not joined kayser v horton  add  th dept  ultimately a majority of the factors weigh in favor of a stay because the federal court has exclusive jurisdiction over the section a claims under the exchange act the federal court will provide a more complete disposition of the claims a stay avoids the risk of inconsistent rulings duplication of effort and waste of judicial resources see one beacon  add at  for the reasons discussed supra the court is not convinced that plaintiffs will suffer undue prejudice as a result of a stay the reaves action was the first action filed but the court in its discretion fins that is not asufficient reason to deny the stay under the specific circumstances of this case plaintiffs motions to consolidate actions cplr  provides that a party may move to consolidate actions involving a common question of law or fact into a single action as a general rule new york courts favor consolidation as a matter of public policy geneva temps inc v new world communities inc  add   dept  notig that there is a preference for consolidation in the interest of judicial economy where there are · common questions oflaw and fact consolidation reduces calendar delays results in judicial economy eliminates the problem of inconsistent results avoids duplication  of  page  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  f discovery· and reduces legal expense and inconvenience to witnesses aman holdings inc v torys llp  add   dept  emphasizing that consolidation was particularly appropriate wheri itwas probable that injustice would result from inconsistent outcomes in the two actions although consolidated actions need not share every factual or legal· issue there must be identity of issues id  here it is undisputed that the actions allege irtually identical facts in support of substantially identical claims against nearly identical defendants defendants do not oppose consolidation if the actions are consolidated plaintiffs request that the consolidated case be assigned the master caption in re resource capital corp shareholder derivative j litigation master index no    they conted that the request is consistent with the courts authority to manage its docket and would further prmote judicial economy and efficiency plaintiffs have made a persuasive argument in favor of consolidation so the  application to consolidate is granted motions to appoint lead counsel the stay of this action will bring the litigation in this court to a complete halt while the litigation proceeds in federal court because notling can happen in this court from this point forward it would serve no useful purpose for the court to appoint lead ·page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  counsel at this stage the issue is moot accordingly it is ordered that defendants crossmotion to stay the actions is granted to the extent of staying further proceedings in the actions except for an application to vacate or modify the stay and it is further ordered that the parties may make an application by order to show cause to vacate or modify this stay upon the fidal determination of the action pending in federal court and it is further ordered that the motions to appoint lead counsel are denied as moot and it is further  ordered that the motion to consolidate is granted and the abovecaptioned action is consolidated in this court with caito v kessler et al index no  simpson v bryant et al index no  and heckel v bryant et al index no  under index no  and the consolidated action shall be assigned the master caption in re resource capital corp shareholder derivative litigation masterlndex no  and it is further ordered that the pleadings in the actions hereby conolidated shall stand as the pleadings in the consolidated action and· it is further ordered that movants are directed to serve a copy of this order with notice page  of   of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  of entry on the county clerk room  b who shall
