origin our producing partners are more knowledgeable about cup quality than ever before while most farmers and cooperatives have long established qc systems throughout the production stage harvesting processing and sorting fewer have been set up to fully evaluate coffee in a cupping lab despite massive exports many coffee producers do not have a strong coffee consumer culture within their own society and even less a discerning coffee palette however as producers have more access to information partnerships and constructive discussion with buyers they are acquiring additional tools to improve their quality analysis all the way to the cup many producer groups are also investing resources in cupping facilities and training for lab technicians to assist in this development optco organizes training sessions roasters visits and covers travel costs to trade shows on top of establishing regular feedback and dialogue about coffee quality throughout the harvest this means a clearer understanding about quality between everyone along the coffee chain and pushes all of us to supply the best product possible into the market the optco cupping team has been evaluating every coffee that comes into our lab since  a supplier sends us a preshipment sample that we analyze at different roast levels to accurately detect any defects or anomalies as well as the more specialized nuances of the specific origin we repeat the evaluation process with an arrival sample once the shipment lands this protocol allows us to stand by the quality of our product provide clear feedback to producers and help match the right coffee with each roaster’s desired profile our goal is to supply our customers with the best specialty coffee that fits perfectly into their lineup organic products

california this was extremely easy i should have filed years ago gregorio sverified customer from new york federal trademark registration faqs still have questions call    or live chat with us for realtime support what is a trademark and why do i need it a trademark is a word phrase symbol andor design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others another party a “service” mark distinguishes the source of a service rather than a good but the two are typically simply referred to as a “trademark” or “mark” in more general terms getting a trademark protects your brand most of the brands logos and slogans you love know and trust have been properly registered by registering your trademark you will be entitled to a presumption of ownership of the brand on a national level and a presumed right to use the brand nationwide it prevents someone from registering a confusingly similar mark after you and allows you to sue in federal court if someone infringes on the brand you have worked hard to build once registered you can also present yourself as an established and serious business because you can start using the ® symbol after your name logo or slogan after you properly register the mark and use it for a fiveyear period trademark engine can also help you file a “declaration of incontestability” giving you the greatest protection under us trademark law this will prevent others from contesting your trademark on grounds often subject to attack such as  the mark is not inherently distinctive  it is confusingly similar to another mark that someone else that began using before you or  the mark is simply functional as opposed to identifying the source of the goods or services you can use special modifiers like ‘in’ ‘from’ etc to focus results based on a channel person or date results can be filtered by recency relevancy and file type so you can easily find what you need what is a common law trademark and why do i need to register my mark under us law you do establish what is known as “common law” when you use your name logo or slogan in commerce even if you do not register it so why pay to register your trademark common law rights are limited to the geographic area where you actually use the mark as opposed to nationwide protection given to you when you register your mark without registration you can be limited to using your mark geographically and not have the ability to expand likewise if someone else is already using your mark in a limited geographic area you can box them in by registering your mark plus should you ever have to sue someone for trademark infringement your registration gives you a leg up in court as to the validity of your mark and your date of usage there are also remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of litigation finally when you let trademark engine file your trademark once accepted you will be on the uspto database which discourages others from using your mark in the future future companies will know your mark is already spoken for and hopefully you can avoid any disputes benefits to registering your mark nationwide protection presumed validity of the mark if you have to sue additional remedies in court may increase the value of your company registration with the uspto will discourage others from trying to use your mark why trademark a name or logo if budget is not an issue the answer is register them both if you need to choose then generally speaking you should start with your name to the extent someone is going to use something of yours it is more likely they will try to use your name protecting your name gives you the broadest protection because it prevents any use of it that is causes confusion even if they someone tries try to use your name within their logo to protect your name you protect it as a “standard character mark” without any notation as to the font coloring or any styling a mark for your logo protects the exact shape orientation stylization and sometimes color in that particular logo the company name can but does not have to be part of the logo registering it the logo protects the logo it and prevents others from using that logo it or something confusingly similar to the logo if you change your logo and want that protected too you will have to file a new application you are much more likely to change your logo than your name to give you an example of a registered logo dispute exxonmobil filed suit against fox for their use of the fxx network logo because of the interlocking x’s the case settled right before trial if within your budget you get the maximum protection when your register both your name and your logo each filing requires its own filing fees per class and fees to trademark engine i have my domain so why do i need a trademark much like the availability of a corporate name in your state does not mean you have superior trademark rights to use the name in commerce the availability of the domain name is not an indication either a company could have a trademark name on a product or service but not have acquired the domain name the availability of the domain name should be one part of a comprehensive search which trademark engine can perform for you to determine the strength of your brand name or slogan and the likelihood of succeeding in trademarking on the domain name if you have been using a domain name as part of a brand that sells goods or services you may have established common law trademark rights under us law you do establish what is known as “common law” when you use your name logo or slogan in commerce even if you do not register it common law rights are limited to the geographic area where you actually use the mark as opposed to nationwide protection given to you when you register your mark without registration you can be limited to using your mark geographically and not have the ability to expand likewise if someone else is already using your mark in a limited geographic area you can box them in by registering your mark plus should you ever have to sue someone for trademark infringement your registration gives you a leg up in court as to the validity of your mark and your date of usage there are also remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of litigation finally when you let trademark engine file your trademark once accepted you will be on the uspto database which discourages others from using your mark future companies will know your mark is already spoken for and hopefully you can avoid any disputes what about my slogan do i register that when you are investing heavily in a marketing campaign with a slogan you should consider registering your slogan as well you can also register short catch phrases or sayings when you are selling them as part of merchandise like shirts or hats the same rules apply that are applicable to picking your company name namely the slogan should be inherently distinctive and creative or have developed a secondary meaning in other words you probably can’t protect “really good pizza” unless that saying has become so famous that most consumers associate it with a certain pizza brand what information will i need the whole process will take anywhere from  to  minutes for a typical application be prepared to provide at least the following the actual mark you want to use be prepared to disclaim any part of the mark that may on its own not be registrable read more here the full legal name and address of the owner of the mark a copy of the specimen which is an example that shows you are using the mark in commerce this could be a picture of your product or a website advertising your service the international class you plan to use which are listed here and on a drop down menu in our system and a description of your good and services the date you first used the mark in commerce and the date you first shared the mark anywhere even if you are the first to use a name you need to be strategic think of the name as a sliding scale between not able to trademark it and easily able to trademark it on the left side of the spectrum or the not trademarkable side are generic names for example you could not trademark the name “the screwdriver company” if you made screwdrivers likewise we could not name this service “online trademark filing company” and get a trademark registration almost as problematic as generic names are merely descriptive names hence “the strong screwdriver company” is also not likely to pass muster with the uspto descriptive marks are only entitled to trademark protection if they have gained secondary meaning that is a legal term of art that means they have become so famous that despite the generic nature the public associates the product with a specific company examples include american airlines or general motors if you aren’t that famous you should not rely upon a secondary meaning to get your generic name through if you are that famous you likely have an army of lawyers geographic names often run into trouble and are considered descriptive “southwest screwdrivers” is likely to run into a challenge of course southwest airlines has become famous enough to have a secondary meaning after descriptive and generic names your chances of being able to register a name starts to improve dramatically the next on that scale is the suggestive mark these hint at the quality or another aspect of the company such as “herculean screwdriver company” it is better than “strong screwdriver” but conveys the same meaning these you can usually register but you run the risk that the uspto says what you thought was suggestive was actually descriptive some popular examples include microsoft which makes software for microcomputers or citibank for financial services brand owners often like these names because it gives the consumer a good idea of what the company does without having to educate them or spending a lot on advertising to get them used to the name for the particular product or service next on the list are arbitrary marks these are existing words used in a way unrelated to their normal everyday meanings hence chocolate screwdrivers may work the textbook example of the arbitrary mark is apple computers  not to be confused with apple records finally fanciful marks are the easiest to get through the uspto a fanciful mark is a made up word or a very rarely used word that has nothing to do with describing the products “glotz” for a screwdriver company may work you are likely familiar with yahoo google exxon and spotify which would all be considered fanciful marks the uspto may reject your name because it is similar to another name already registered that is why you should run a search before you file because if the uspto rejects your application the fees to trademark engine and the uspto are not refundable in addition to being too similar to another name the mark may be rejected because it is a surname it is geographically descriptive of where you are doing business is disparaging think of the current challenge to the washington redskins football team it is a foreign term that translates to a generic or descriptive english term it uses an individual’s name or likeness or is the title of a single book or movie allow trademark engine to assist you with
