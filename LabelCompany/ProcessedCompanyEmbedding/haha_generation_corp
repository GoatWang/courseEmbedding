system”means that when the electric vehicle is in the motion how to retrieve and transform the kinetic energy to the electronic power within the car  the electric vehicle has a  horsepower motor with a maximum speed of kmhr  each electric vehicle equipped with two sets of lithium iron battery aaann and battery baann when the electric vehicle is in the motion it is first supply by the battery a and when battery a is dropped to  of its electric energy the system will automatically switch to battery bat the same time all electric generators will recharge allocation of  in the group of  sets of electric powers  of battery a  the  sets of elliptical tires both in the middle and the back will produce fixed vibration frequency while the car is in the motion this vibration frequency can produce kinetic energy and will be transforming to the electric energy and continuous the recycle of the electric energy  tire pressure generatorby using two sets of builtin interior sliding axis’s elasticity to activate the electric generatorwhen the electric vehicle is in the motionthe tires’ contact point to the road has the most pressure by using this pressure to activate the electric generator to

compliance with reporting requirements pursuant to the securities exchange act of  the foregoing purposes represent our best estimate of the allocation of the gross proceeds from this offering based upon the current state of our business operations current plans and the current economic and industry conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors including the status of our development efforts sales and marketing activities the amount of cash generated or used by our operations we planned our progress based on raising  from this offering we have taken careful consideration to determine that  is the amount we need to sustain our operations for the next  months in the event that we do not realize the full proceeds from this offering we will be forced to scale back our efforts to accommodate for a reduced amount of funds in this event we will be required to consider the then available options to determine how to fund the shortfall those options include the private placement of our securities and loans from third parties andor hsuanhsien liao our sole director and chief executive officer any interruption in our business will greatly reduce our chances for success we reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of a the need for more working capital we may determine that we need more working capital in order to implement the growth strategy and operations set forth herein the reallocation of any funds may necessitate an additional sale of our equity securities there are no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital from any institution or individual investors there are many barriers of entry in the clothing market and the level of competition is extremely high examples of barriers of entry in this market include brand loyalty aggressive lower pricing tactics and economies of scale many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their clothing products to shinin’s aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for us to enter and compete in this market economies of scale make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of clothing products which would leave us at a disadvantage the principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and the quality of our products we will be in a market where we will be in direct competition with many domestic and international companies offering competing products many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers many of these companies may have a greater and more established customer base than us we will likely lose prospective business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for competing products than us which may also cause us to lose prospective business we also foresee challenges facing new market entrants we may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we have not yet entered the market once we enter the market we will be one of many participants in the business of distributing clothing products many established and wellfinanced entities are currently active in the business of distributing such products nearly all of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us we are consequently at a competitive disadvantage in the market therefore we may not be able to establish ourselves within the industry company
