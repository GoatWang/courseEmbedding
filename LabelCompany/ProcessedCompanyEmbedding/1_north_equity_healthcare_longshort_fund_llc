equity longshort equity is an investing strategy of taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline a longshort equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions although this may not always be the case the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions or the other way around the longshort equity strategy is popular with hedge funds many of which employ a marketneutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal breaking down longshort equity while many hedge funds also employ a longshort equity strategy with a long bias such as  where long exposure is  and short exposure is  comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their longshort strategy longshort equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography advanced economies emerging markets europe etc sector energy technology etc investment philosophy value or growth and so on an example of a longshort equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund a popular variation of the longshort model is that of the “pair trade which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector for example an investor in the technology space may take a long position in microsoft and offset that with a short position in intel if the investor buys  shares of microsoft at  each and intel is trading at  the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing  intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal the ideal situation for this longshort strategy would be for microsoft to appreciate and for intel to decline if microsoft rises to  and intel falls to  the overall profit on this strategy would be  even if intel advances to  – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at  although much less so to get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison longshort strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs for example if interest rates are rising a hedge fund may short interestsensitive sectors such as utilities and go long on defensive sectors such as health care trading center longshort fund longshort ratio equity market neutral net exposure dedicated short bias market neutral net short short the basis weak shorts next up dictionary  a b c

definitions new fund launches investment conferences  hedge fund articles home hedge fund strategy  equity longshort an equity longshort strategy is an investing strategy used primarily by hedge funds that involves taking long positions in stocks that are expected to increase in value and short positions in stocks that are expected to decrease in value you may know that taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it if the stock increases in value you will make money on the other hand taking a short position in a stock means borrowing a stock you don’t own usually from your broker selling it then hoping it declines in value at which time you can buy it back at a lower price than you paid for it and return the borrowed shares hedge funds using equity longshort strategies simply do this on a grander scale at its most basic level an equity longshort strategy consists of buying an undervalued stock and shorting an overvalued stock ideally the long position will increase in value and the short position will decline in value if this happens and the positions are of equal size the hedge fund will benefit that said the strategy will work even if the long position declines in value provided that the long position outperforms the short position thus the goal of any equity longshort strategy is to minimize exposure to the market in general and profit from a change in the difference or spread between two stocks that may sound complicated so let’s look at a hypothetical example let’s say a hedge fund takes a  million long position in pfizer and a  million short position in wyeth both large pharmaceutical companies with these positions any event that causes all pharmaceutical stocks to fall will lead to a loss on the pfizer position and a profit on the wyeth position similarly an event that causes both stocks to rise will have little effect since the positions balance each other out so the market risk is minimal why then would a portfolio manager take such a position because he or she thinks pfizer will perform better than wyeth equity longshort strategies such as the one described which hold equal dollar amounts of long and short positions are called market neutral strategies but not all equity longshort strategies are market neutral some hedge fund managers will maintain a long bias as is the case with socalled “” strategies with these strategies hedge funds have  exposure to long positions and  exposure to short positions other structures are also used such as  long and  short few hedge funds have a longterm short bias since the equity markets tend to move up over time equity longshort managers can also be distinguished by the geographic market in which they invest the sector in which they invest financial health care or technology for example or their investment style value or quantitative for example buying and selling two related stocks—for example two stocks in the same region or industry—is called a “paired trade” model it may limit risk to a specific subset of the market instead of the market in general equity longshort strategies have been used by sophisticated investors such as institutions for years they became increasingly popular among individual investors as traditional strategies struggled in the most recent bear market highlighting the need for investors to consider expanding their portfolios into innovative financial solutions   equity longshort strategies are not without risks these strategies have all the generic hedge fund risks for example hedge funds are typically not as liquid as mutual funds meaning it is more difficult to sell shares the strategies they use could lead to significant losses and they can have high fees additionally equity longshort strategies have some unique risks the main one is that the portfolio manager must correctly predict the relative performance of two stocks which can be difficult another risk results from what is referred to in the industry as “beta mismatch” while this is more complicated that we can explain in detail here essentially it means that when the stock market declines sharply long positions could lose more than short positions in summary equity longshort strategies may help increase returns in difficult market environments but also involve some risk as a result investors considering these strategies may want to ensure that their hedge funds follow strict rules to evaluate market risks and find good investment opportunities get comprehensive and uptodate information on   hedge funds funds of funds and ctas in the barclay
