centermelissa s ratedhall chiropractic and family wellness center is undoubtedly one of the best chiropractic offices in the area i can say this having tried out many other chiropractic and wellness centers across dfw some with success and others not so much but the doctors hall mike and cara are truly in a league of their own they are both genuinely caring people who enjoy educating spreading wellness and building a community in addition to treating chiropractic issues i often see whole families come in together for chiropractic care the office itself is clean well decorated and provides a warm relaxing atmospherei have been a patient of dr mike hall for about  years and he is not just a great chiropractor but also a great man he initially rehabbed me after a very serious car wreck in which i was rear ended at a stop light i was diagnosed with whiplash stretched spinal cord and concussion i was in so much pain i could barely move or speak i had constant headachesdr hall was gentle patient and caring he treated me in the office and gave me exercises to do at home to facilitate my recovery he empowered me to take charge of my own well beingprior to dr hall i had seen chiropractors regularly for about ten years i am an active person had recurrent neckshoulderrib problems for many years each visit would provide temporary relief yet id develop pain again increasingly over the next days and weeks until i absolutely had to see the chiropractor again after the rehab with dr hall i noticed that i didnt have the recurring what i called the flaming sword between my shoulder blades something that i had begun to think was going to be a life long burdena major criticism about chiropractic is that you need to constantly go to appointments otherwise your pain will return let me be the first to tell you thats not the case making the investment in the expertise of dr hall and doing my part with home care exercise and nutrition is the best thing i could have ever done for my healthi continue to visit him from time to time for maintenance when i have an issue or when i just want to immerse myself in a loving nurturing positive environment i always leave breathing easier with a smile on my face he has worked with me on all my medical issues suggesting supplements and workouts for my various needs i am always treated with respect and kindness by dr hall his wife cara and their staffi recommend family clients and friends to hall chiropractic and family wellness center because i know they will receive the best care possibleposture perfect wellness centerrbrenmore ratedi finally found a place where i finally found a place where the doctors actually care about the patients i was diagnosed with a back problem years ago the pain was getting so bad that it has been difficult for me to pick up my kids without shooting pain and then soreness afterwards i recently moved back to dallas and needed to find a good doctor to help me with my problem i was looking for a place that took my insurance and lucky for me i was referred here i have never been to a place like posture perfect wellness center before they took a different approach to treating me i was worked on by  doctors who came up with a treatment plan together it was really different watching the doctors discuss how they were going to put a plan together specifically for me utilizing chiropractic physical therapy and medical care in that first visit i learned more about my condition sciatica disc herniation and the cause of it  i also learned about my treatment options and the risk of possible surgery if this condition gets worse the doctors explained to me everything i needed to know on the types of treatments for this problem and tailored a program with me that would fit my lifestyle in order to get better step by step i think that this is the future of healthcare and i recommend this place to anyone who is looking for more of a comprehensive clinical approach to their health today was my th treatment i received a deep tissue massage chiropractic treatment and physical therapy i have to say that this is the best i have felt in years if you are sick and tired

a ct scan showed severe bulging of the lower discs of my spine which was placing pressure on the sciatic nerve on a scale of  to  the pain was a  after having dr adorable review my medical files and filling him in on my history of injuries he reassured me that he could offer some if not total relief from the pain after  weeks of having him make adjustments to my spine and spinal decompression treatments the pain went from a  to a  as i sit here now writing this it is a  no pain whatsoever he is not one to fill you full of false hopes his honesty in the possibilities of helping my situation was reassuring i still have several sessions to go before completing the recommended treatment i would like to thank him and his wonderful staff for giving me my life back and yes his staff is superb

back playing basketball i was not going to let that stop me i originally went into see my doctor and he referred me to an orthopedic surgeon luckily the first thing he told me was that i should do conservative treatment and if that did not work he would recommend surgery i found posture perfect online i liked the fact that all of the clinicians working at the facility were either former athletes or still playing sports also i was really impressed with the fact that they had a comprehensive approach to treating patients i was able to see the physical therapist the medical pain management specialist and the chiropractor i think it took about  weeks for the pain to be completely gone i am still seeing the massage therapist the personal trainer and chiropractor for more active care but i have to say that i feel so much stronger and healthier than i have in years i have referred many family members friends and coworkers to posture perfect and i would highly advise anyone who is suffering from old athletic injuries back pain headaches or any other condition involving pain to go therespinalworks dallaslinda w ratedfriendly relatable drs w a genuine interest in your overall

and like to get my back adjusted every once in a while usually after some kind of a home improvement project it seems i was not picky at first since most of the places i ended up in did an ok job but posture perfect has consistently sent me home feeling great and better educated about my posture and wellness in general i leave there on a high every time i am  now i always wanted to improve my posture and when i go for a few consecutive visits i actually see a difference in the way i stand and sit at the office i love that they get me to pop without too much pressure it means they know what to move and they dont just force it it feels healthy and the results last longer every time i go i love the new setup and the wellness approach which makes it feel a little more casual and less like a forced appointment with my doctor it is properly named a wellness center and i cant wait for my next visit thank youposture perfect wellness centercbigler ratedi am  years old and occasioni am  years old and occasionally suffer from a car accident where i was broadsided tboned when i was  years old it keeps me from doing heavy exercises without pain or stiffening  its definitely manageable but annoying at times i went in and met with dr lohr and his staff i really liked the team at posture perfect  all very nice folks that made me feel at home they too me through the entire clinic explaining what will be done to help lessen the pain and i was adjusted by dr long seeing xrays of my spine and neck was kind of cool but also helped me understand where some of my issues are ill definitely do a followup visit and am looking forward to learning more about proper nutrition  diet from dr lohr if you have issues and recurrent pain from a car accident then i recommend seeing these

keywords jesus tiberius gospels historiography abstract since the introduction to the critical method of studying the old and new testament in the nineteenth century doubt has been thrown on the historical reliability of the biblical narrative accounts especially the four gospels yet far less scrutiny and denigration have been applied to historical sources written during the time of the roman empire a comparison then is proposed it would be beneficial to compare the sources that detailed the life and ministry of jesus of nazareth namely matthew mark luke and john and the four sources which chronicled the life of tiberius emperor of the roman empire during the ministry of jesus how do the sources compare as to their composition in proximity to their subject do the sources agree with one another is there a level of objectivity in the sources that allowed them to present the correct details of their subject these questions will determine the reliability of the documents in question and whether the four gospels measure up to critical examination recommended citation chrisman timothy b  jesus and tiberius an examination of source reliability eleutheria vol   iss   article  available
