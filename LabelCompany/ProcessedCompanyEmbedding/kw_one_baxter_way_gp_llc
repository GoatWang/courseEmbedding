generac guardian series generator interesting note generac doesnt reveal the engines horsepower online in the sales information and it is not written anywhere on the engine but there is a way to figure it out a general rule of thumb for generators is the generator requires a  horsepower engine for every kilowatt the generator produces another way to calculate the horsepower required for a generator is to use the following formulahp  kw x wherehp  horsepowerkw  kilowatt  horsepower to kilowatt conversion constantanother useful fact is  horsepower is equal to  wattstools required strap or filter wrench only if you have trouble tightening or loosening the filter by hand pliers only if you have problems loosening the drain plug oil drain panspecifications generac recommends using
