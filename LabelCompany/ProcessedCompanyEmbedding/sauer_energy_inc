finest quality products in the renewable energy arena are a testament to this as well let us never forget to respect and make the most positive use of nature’s  gifts to us it’s time we all do our share why we believe in the verticalaxis wind turbine vawt with energy prices spiraling out of control many businesses are searching for ways to reduce and control energy costs it is a trend that is also fostering a great deal of interest in renewableenergy options wind power is the fastest growing alternative energy segment it provides an attractive cost structure relative to other alternative energy and distributed generation solutions such as cogeneration and solar power the wind power market has been dominated by large horizontal wind turbines they have the traditional blade design that looks like a giant fan clustered mostly on “wind farms” located in rural areas these large systems seriously compromise the ability of many companies to take advantage of wind power right at their building or plant this is due to the economics of horizontal wind turbines that favor large units multiplemegawatt installations and current technology dynamics however new advancements have come on line in recent years related to the vawt  advancements which include small wind inverters utilizing mppt blade construction and permanent magnet generator pmg design  vawts address a number of the large horizontal wind turbine technologys known shortcomings such as noise pollution minimum blade speed threshold bird endangerment and space limitation which further enhances its own advantages system design the verticalaxis design is a compact turbine design that can be sited on location without being intrusive and has been designed to be integrated directly into existing buildings this size advantage allows for structures as small as an office building or as large as a hospital to utilize the benefits of a vawt economically onsite installations dramatically improve the return on investment of wind power not to mention the rebates now in the offering power generated offsite such as at wind farms is still subject to transmission and distribution charges conversely onsite solutions take a portion of the organizational power requirements off the grid blade speed a traditional horizontal blade design turbine of similar size requires a greater level of wind speed to generate power the vertical axis turbine design also provides omnidirectional wind collection the torque produced allows it to make power while turning at slower blade speeds it only takes a  mph wind to turn the blades one benefit of this feature is obvious it can work at locations with lower average wind speeds therefore the geographic option for using wind energy is greatly expanded a company may not need to be located on a hilltop or in coastal locations to reap the benefits plus it reduces wind direction limitations because it can collect wind power on a degree basis horizontal blade technology must spend time and energy turning into the wind when the wind changes direction environmental impact the slower blade tip speed has environmental improvements as well first it is very quiet when operating unlike traditional wind turbines the vertical axis turbine has the blades connected at both ends and the blades do not swing by the tower and create noise also with no highspeed wing tips exposed the vertical axis turbine has a relatively low impact on bird populations   copyright   sauerenergycom all rights reserved  vawtsu    the turbine home the turbinetechnology

technologies in new power generation in ” said gwec secretary general steve sawyer wind energy is now the world’s fastest growing source of energy the forecast in the next twenty years is that it will expand at exorbitant rates the united states department of energy doe the american wind energy association awea the national renewable energy laboratory nrel have all stated that  of the nation’s total consumable electricity can come from renewable wind energy within the next twenty years this would result in cumulative wind turbine sales of over  billion to  billion the growth is driven from numerous factors in which realization that oil natural gas and coal supplies are diminishing while the world demand is increasing taken into further consideration is that currently the use of these contribute to pollution and global warming not to mention that the cost to produce and the rising prices have exploited the end user the use of nuclear power has a substantial risk for large scale side effects currently the world has refocused on renewable energy resources of which wind energy is in the forefront one of the most compelling reasons wind turbines are expected to continue their strong growth rate for decades to come is that the cost per kwh of energy produced is expected to be the cheapest source of energy like many other alternative energies wind energy does not require any fuel therefore it can generate electricity as long as the wind blows wind energy is also one of the cleanest forms of alternative energy in fact according to the united states department of energys wind energy program a single utility scale wind turbine  kw displaces approximately  tons of co emissions annually based on the current us energy mixs average emissions according to the awea clean wind energy avoids significant carbon dioxide co emissions annually by displacing generation from fossil fuel power plants in  the  million megawatthours mwh generated by wind energy avoided an estimated  million metric tons of co the equivalent of reducing power sector co emissions by  or the equivalent emissions of  million cars sauer energy’s vawt systems intend to be among the lowest cost wind energy producers our turbines can be produced and manufactured on a large scale in fabrication factories throughout the world the installation cost of our turbines will be considerably less the cost of horizontal axis wind turbines because of their directdrive system they are less expensive to maintain and repair their key parts are few and at ground level the world over governments are taking action to advance renewable wind energy more and more states are mandatorily commissioning renewable energy at the local government level utility companies are being obligated to provide renewable energy to meet escalating demand an international trading program has begun for carbon and renewable energy credits thus providing the full support of wind energy lucrative incentives in the form of rebates and tax credits are being offered to offset the initial expense and demonstrate how committed our government is to renewable energy the availability and reliability of wind energy will expand the use where and when it is needed present technological trends will likely lend to a longterm future where wind provides the majority of the primary power resources for the planet sauer energy is planning to be instrumental in providing a significant percentage of fulfilling this output we cannot forget the one and only fact that we must take care of our earth and the earth will take
