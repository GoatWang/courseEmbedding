company spun out of biogen’s hemophilia business we bring a strong legacy of innovation worldclass science and commitment to the rare blood disorders community we are united by a singular purpose to create progress where patients need it most we believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders beginning with hemophilia we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop lifechanging treatments   john g cox ceo our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia a and b in nearly two decades and are the first extended halflife clotting factors introduced to patients we will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors longterm joint health and women with bleeding disorders in the same spirit as in hemophilia we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders including cold agglutinin disease sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia press releases watch creating progress together together we are committed to making a significant positive impact for patients and society through innovative programs that aim to improve access to treatment advance disease understanding and create true partnership with the community our commitment to that purpose is reflected in our name “bio” refers to our legacy of scientific innovation which we will build upon and “ver” refers to the latin word veritas meaning truth “ativ” is based on the word active —we will actively work with the community build trust and create change for patients × therapies
