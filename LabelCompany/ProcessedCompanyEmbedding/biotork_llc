copyright biotork  fuel ethanol – biotork biotork evolving beyond the imagination fuel ethanol in this industry substrates such as corn or sugarcane are fermented by yeast in order to make ethanol to be used as fuel although a promising source of renewable energy this process is not without its challenges while the fuel ethanol industry is mature and produces approximately  billion gallons of renewable fuel per year worldwide there is constant pressure to find new ways of optimizing production of course an important way of achieving this goal is to reduce or eliminate the limitations on the process imposed by the yeasts themselves such limitations include – poor heat and acid tolerance – reliance on the need to add expensive enzymes – poor tolerance to high ethanol titers in short biotork is striving to improve the yeasts used in the creation of fuel ethanol in order to make the production of this renewable energy more costefficient therefore encouraging its use over that of nonrenewable fossil fuel view biotork’s profile on facebookview biotork’s profile on twitter copyright biotork  consumer alcohol – biotork biotork evolving beyond the imagination consumer alcohol the distilled spirits industry has seen a tremendous increase in demand and producers are struggling to meet it because the processes used to ferment spirits like whiskey are largely constrained by tradition the easiest place to improve productivity is by improving the actual yeasts that transform grain into alcohol biotork has developed strains of yeast with higher alcohol productivity on

twitter copyright biotork  phytase – biotork biotork evolving beyond the imagination phytase phytase is an enzyme used in the processing of animal feed and food in order to increase nutrient availability by breaking down phytate a nonaccessible form of phosphorus with antinutrient properties by adding phytase to animal feed phosphorus iron zinc and calcium are made more bioavailable and less inorganic mineral additions to feed are needed not only does this shrink the costs of processing animal feed it also decreases environmental eutrophication by reducing the amount of nutrients released through waste and contaminating the environment at biotork we have used our technology to develop a more efficient and costeffective manner by which to produce phytase enzyme in addition we have been granted a worldwide exclusive license from the university of florida to access an extremely heat tolerant phytase this is extremely significant because the major challenge encountered when using phytase is that like most enzymes it is deactivated by the high temperatures used in the processing of animal feed a lowcost source of heattolerant phytase enzymes that are unaffected by processing conditions as biotork is working to create will have a huge beneficial impact on the production of animal feed and consequently our planet to read our press release on this topic click here

sustainable gmofree vegan omega oil produced from algae this omega oil will be launched in the nutraceutical feed and food industries worldwide as a direct replacement to fish oil until now the performance of algae has been either improved through genetic modification or rely on wild microbes and generally uses a refined and costly substrate not only are gmos an issue for entry into a consumer sector but also relying on an expensive process is a major drawback for having a competitive product biotork’s product is naturally evolved not genetically modified and therefore does not carry the gmo label biotork’s omega oil is  percent from algae and can therefore be consumed by vegans and vegetarians the algae is grown on several agroindustrial waste or byproducts that are globally massively available these substrates are completely renewable eudes de crecy ceo of biotork commenting about the company’s future involvement in the omega industry “we will have the means to seriously move the lines in this global challenge of delivering alternative omega sources this will help alleviate the current supplydemand issues and contribute to a much higher quality food” in addition to overfishing issues fish also accumulate mercury and other heavy metals through their diet and therefore fish oil contains at the very least trace amounts of mercury and heavy metals algae does not contain such heavy metals and therefore biotork’s omega oil is free of heavy metals manufacturers also often use solvents to extract dha from oil to get higher concentrations of dha in their products biotork’s oil is naturally concentrated with a high dha content  percent dha extracted using a mechanical expelling process that results in an unaltered higher quality oil the quality of this oil allows for market penetration in the nutraceuticals and high quality food industry for highend applications biotork’s omega oil is set to hit pilot scale stage by early  with demonstration and commercial production following shortly thereafter mr de crecy added about the coming scaleup stage “robustness is a key advantage of our development platform we are therefore confident that the
