guarantee of future results diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of

for the quarter ended june   in consumer discretionary our overweight position in walt disney co  portfolio weighting detracted from performance after fiscal secondquarter earnings showed

offerings such as youtube tv and hulu live help offset traditional subscriber declines and as espn’s distribution renewals start later this year in the industrials sector our overweight in general electric co  portfolio weighting underperformed after the company released disappointing quarterly free cash flow conversion results we remain encouraged by its strong trends in orders and margins and find value in the stability of its power and healthcare units in financials an overweight in citigroup inc  portfolio weighting added value as investors cheered the prospects of a stronger capital return plan and interpreted the treasury department’s recent white paper to indicate a greater likelihood for a more favorable regulatory landscape for financials we remain attracted to the company’s free cash flow and net payout yield profiles within health care our overweight in unitedhealth group inc  portfolio weighting contributed following a broadbased earnings beat due to betterthanexpected revenues and medical loss ratios and a tax rate that came in below expectations we continue to believe unitedhealth can sustain differentiated doubledigit earnings per share growth due to the positioning of its quality health plan assets and the highgrowth sophisticated tools offered by its optum unit looking ahead we expect the momentum experienced during the postelection period to largely continue throughout the remainder of  the continuation of the earnings environment experienced during the second quarter should be largely supportive of our positioning the broadbased growth it yielded is likely to offer a tailwind for our constructive outlook on the us equity market while the intersector dislocations that emerged this quarter should offer added potential for alpha
