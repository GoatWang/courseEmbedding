virtual piggy inc changes its name to rego payment architectures inc virtual piggy inc changes its name to rego payment architectures inc news provided by virtual piggy inc mar    et share this article palm beach fla march   prnewswire  virtual piggy creators of the only coppa compliant technology aimed at providing payment capability for the under  market is changing its name to reflect the evolution of the company into broader paymentrelated markets rego payment architectures inc otcqb rpmt becomes an umbrella under which the ip developed becomes available to many different industries beyond the under  market its exciting to see the development process here as weve solved some very complicated issues around oink says ceo john coyne utilizing our proprietary technology we believe that we have the opportunity to create something bigger herebeyond just the scope of the original market served by oink we believe that we have an opportunity to create revolutionary advancements in payment architecture rego is a latin word that has multiple meanings and contexts  first it means to administer and the underlying architecture we have designed is replete with regulatory controls that assure the administration of full payment compliance  our payment architecture also allows sponsors to set the boundaries and conditions for the use of the payment platform rego also means to guide and a central theme of rego is to teach effective financial discipline and prepare users for a digital economy that moves and changes at a rapid pace  we believe that regos platform framework makes it one of the most adaptable payment architectures yet created   coyne further stated when i came on board as ceo my goal was to transform the company from a card payment system to a mobile payment platform i wanted to develop more than just a payment system for childreni wanted to create a business with multiple revenue sources that broaden our potential base of users and assure our investors that we are not just a one product company this rebranding is a significant benchmark in our progress toward  fulfillment of that promise rego is the vehicle for that larger vision founded on validated artificial intelligence techniques regos core base of technology has broad capability to adapt to a broad range of payment markets and users  this core technology comprises retro real time regulatory oversight a system of reasoning engines and a contract model cm that allows the creation of specific boundary conditions for its use in totality these underlying technologies make for a powerful and adaptive system  assuming we can complete our funding requirements we believe that rego is now poised to see significantly expanded market potential as part and parcel of the repositioning of our corporate image we are restructuring the company to prepare for multiple market entry says coyne  rego will be the holding company for our proprietary intellectual property and will license its technology to rego operating subsidiaries and third parties  the under  market will be served by regos new operating subsidiary oink inc which will have an exclusive global field of use license for this market  this restructuring of licensing and operating units protects the ip and the operating units alike coyne further observed we have been in discussion with global system integrators that believe our platform is perfect for complex welfare payment control especially in europe where there has become an increased dependence on welfare benefits  with our cm contract model and retro governments would now be able to map the benefits programs to their regulations and control the use of benefits proceeds to assure that the money is being spent efficiently effectively and in the manner intended  welfare benefits comprise on average  of country gdp oced report —and up to  for france  welfare benefits account for  billion dollars in expenditure for france alone we are exploring closed loop processing  in a closed loop system our platform allows the direct payment of settlements to merchants without the complexity and expense of using open payment interchanges which is typically how debit and credit cards are processed with our closed loop platform capability we have access to untapped potential users and direct and exclusive access to the transaction fees coyne stated that we are in discussion with retailers that want to use our system to disintermediate the current payment rails and save on processing fees which can be  or more of retail sales  for a large retail chain this could mean savings of billions of dollars per year the attraction of regos architecture is more than mobility and convenience its dollars and cents in a very real way further we can monitor users activities—data related to how where and when they spend would become another proprietary source of revenue driven by our internal analytics engines and made available to our retail partners finally we believe that the unbanked can be another significant market  these are people dependent on the cash market that have minimal access to traditional banking and the digital payment capability that comes with it a dollar of cash churns every six hours in the cash economy compared to twenty days or more in the banked community this churn represents over a trillion dollars in annual spending and we can capture a significant piece of this market with partners that directly service this demographic coyne observed  we think of our platform as a car chassis says coyne using the chassis concept we can modify the components to make a family sedan or super car where we might license one technology to ford and another to mclaren that is the power of adding specificity to a powerful generalized model on demand based in palm beach florida regoinc holds three technology patents us patent no   and    to view the original version on pr newswire

it will also give feedback for specialized incentive programs that promote good financial discipline this capability is significantly innovative to the extent that it will become important not just for children but the entire familys payment requirements anywhere flexible rules can be applied to financial management coyne added  once the power of this system is realized compared with alternative payment systems the whole family will want to use it  oink s impact system goes beyond typical bill pay systems by automating the kind of decisions people make daily impact and its fundamental

elsewhere in this report overview virtual piggy inc the company we or us was incorporated in delaware on february   under the name chimera international group inc on april   we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to moggle inc on august   we filed a certificate of ownership with the secretary of state of delaware pursuant to which the companys newlyformed whollyowned subsidiary virtual piggy incorporated was merged into and with the company the merger in connection with the merger and in accordance with on december   the company incorporated a newlyformed whollyowned subsidiary finity inc on december   the company filed a statement of correction with the pennsylvania department of state to change the name of finity inc to finitii inc the purpose of finitii inc is to teach children financial responsibility as a not for profit organization management believes that a future alternative for virtual piggy inc will revolve around the fintech industry with a partnerfirst go to market model in which established payments market leaders and vertical market participants can incorporate and integrate the companys platform into cobranded payments solutions targeting youth and family management believes this approach will enable the company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach within this partnerfirst model the company is incorporating licensing fees and customization services this should enable the company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees in addition we are analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the business to business bb realm to date we have not generated material revenues in  we earned revenue by charging a percentage to the merchant or gaming publisher for each transaction processed which continued until march  when the decision was made to discontinue the oink product offering as we proceed through  we expect to generate additional revenue streams by generating licensing and customization fees from our cobranding partners strategic outlook we believe that the virtual goods market and the fintech industry will continue to grow over the long term within the market and industry we intend to provide services to allow transactions with children in compliance with coppa and similar international privacy laws we believe that this particular opportunity is relatively untapped and expect to be a leading provider of online transactions for children sustained spending on technology our ability to raise additional financing the continued growth of the fintech industry and compliance with regulatory and reporting requirements are all external conditions that may affect our ability to execute our business plan in addition the fintech industry is intensely competitive and most participants have longer operating histories significantly greater financial technical marketing customer service and other resources and greater name recognition in addition certain potential customers particularly large organizations may view our small size and limited financial resources as a negative even if they prefer our offering to those of our competitors table of contents our primary strategic objectives over the next  months are to increase our user base and the engagement level of that base we plan to achieve that by implementing our partnerfirst go to market model in which established payments market leaders and vertical market participants can incorporate and integrate the companys platform into cobranded payments solutions targeting youth and family management believes this approach will enable the company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach within this partnerfirst model the company is incorporating licensing fees and customization services this should enable the company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees we believe that our nearterm success will depend particularly on our ability to develop customer awareness and confidence in our service since we have limited capital resources we will need to closely manage our expenses and conserve our cash by continually monitoring any increase in expenses and reducing or eliminating unnecessary expenditures our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets that we have limited financial resources and face an uncertain economic environment we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and  the following discussion analyzes our results of operations for the years ended december   and  the following information should be considered together with our financial statements for such periods and the accompanying notes thereto

december   subsequent to december   the company raised gross proceeds of  through the issuance of notes payable as we have not realized significant revenues since our inception we have financed our operations through public and private offerings of debt and equity securities we do not currently maintain a line of credit or term loan with any commercial bank or other financial institution since our inception we have focused on developing and implementing our business plan we believe that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain our operations during the next twelve months we currently need to generate sufficient revenues to support our cost structure to enable us to pay ongoing costs and expenses as they are incurred finance the development of our platform and execute the business plan if we cannot generate sufficient revenue to fund our business plan we intend to seek to raise such financing through the sale of debt andor equity securities the issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders if we are unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to us we will be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we are successful in generating sufficient revenue or in raising sufficient capital in order to complete the platform our ability to continue in business as a viable going concern can only be achieved when our revenues reach a level that sustains our business operations we raised approximately  million through our issuance of convertible notes payable and another  million through the issuance of notes payable the launch of the platform is expected in the fourth quarter of  however we do not project that significant revenue will be developed until later in  there can be no assurance that we will raise sufficient proceeds or any proceeds for us to implement fully our proposed business plan moreover there can be no assurance that even if platform is developed and launched that we will generate revenues sufficient to fund our operations in either such situation we may not be able to continue our operations and our business might fail as of april   the company has a cash position of approximately  based upon the current cash position and the companys planned expense run rate management believes the company will not be able to finance its operations through april  the foregoing forwardlooking information was prepared by us in good faith based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable no assurance can be given however regarding the attainability of the projections or the reliability of the assumptions on which they are based the projections are subject to the uncertainties inherent in any attempt to predict the results of our operations especially where new products and services are involved certain of the assumptions used will inevitably not materialize and unanticipated events will occur actual results of operations are therefore likely to vary from the projections and such variations may be material and adverse to us accordingly no assurance can be given that such results will be achieved moreover due to changes in technology new product announcements competitive pressures system design andor other specifications we may be required to change the current plans table of contents offbalance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships critical accounting policies our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation a complete summary of these policies is included in note  of the notes to financial statements included elsewhere herein we have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management stockbased compensation we have adopted the fair value recognition provisions financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  in addition the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no  sharebased payment sab  in march  which provides supplemental fasb asc  application guidance based on the views of the sec under fasb asc  compensation cost recognized includes compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted beginning january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  we have used the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the option fair values the optionpricing model requires a number of assumptions of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility the expected prevesting forfeiture rate and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire all issuances of stock options or other equity instruments to nonemployees as consideration for goods or services received by the company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued nonemployee equity based payments that do not vest immediately upon grant are recorded as an expense over the service period as if the company had paid cash for the services at the end of each financial reporting period prior to the completion of the services the fair value of the equity based payments will be remeasured and the noncash expense recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly since the fair value of equity based payments granted to nonemployees is subject to change in the future the amount of the future expense will include fair value remeasurements until the equity based payments are fully vested or the service is completed revenue recognition in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition codified in fasb asc  we will recognize revenue
