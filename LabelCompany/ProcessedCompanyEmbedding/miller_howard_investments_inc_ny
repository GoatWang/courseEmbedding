financial advisor risk factors to consider when investing in mlps cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with the mlps operating or business performance mlps typically have a general partner that maintains an aggregate  general partner interest unit holders will have limited voting rights and do not own an interest in vote with or control the general partner the general partner often cannot be removed without its own consent and the general partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of unit holders the mlp may issue additional common units diluting existing unit holders’ interests unit holders may be required to pay taxes on income from the mlp even if they do not receive cash distributions the irs could reclassify the mlp as a taxable entity which could reduce the cash available for distribution to unit holders if at any time the gp owns  or more of the issued and outstanding limited partner interests the gp will have the right to purchase all of the limited partnership interests not held by the gp at a price that may be undesirable mlp tax considerations the tax treatment for investors in mlps is different than that of an investment in stock including a the investors share of the mlps income deductions and expenses are reported on schedule k not form  b because of the possibility of unrelated business taxable income charitable remainder trusts should not invest in this strategy and other nontaxable investors such as erisa and ira accounts should

portfolio highlights unfixed income portfolio companies pay and grow dividends providing high current income and increasing income over time by focusing on dividend growth we help clients meet income needs today and in the future dividend growth — a better “analyst” than analysts dividend and dividend increases help confirm past and current financial reports and are one of the best signals from management about current and future prospects for a company diversified compounding machine over time it is compounding income — not style sector or asset classes — that is a main driver of longterm returns investors can reinvest income and dollar cost average earning on both their original investments and also on their earnings portfolio overview incomeequity strategy is a diversified dividendgrowth equity portfolio that seeks high current dividend income plus growth of income and principal stocks are primarily us based multicap companies from across the broad equity market in the portfolio  can be invested in foreign stocks that trade on us exchanges adrs and up to  can be exchangetraded master limited partnerships mlps this strategy has the potential to provide “unfixed income” from stocks with high current yields and growth of cash flow from dividends investors seeking solid total returns that comprise both income and growth high current income that may increase every year potential for inflation protection and a lower federal tax rate on qualified dividends will find this strategy attractive because this version of incomeequity includes mlps it will generate k tax reports investment philosophy consistent with our firm philosophy this portfolio invests in financially strong companies with rising dividends our disciplined investment process focuses on compounding income — not style sector or asset allocation — which is the main driver of longterm returns many studies including our own show that dividendpaying stocks have historically outperformed nondividendpaying stocks and companies that increase their dividends tend to perform the best stock prices may fluctuate but dividends when paid are always positive and unlike bonds with static income equities with growth of income help protect investors from the ravages of inflation even a “tame” inflation rate of  can destroy almost two thirds of an investors purchasing power over  years portfolio objective our investment objective is to provide high current income growth of income and growth of principal as conservatively as possible while investing in the equity markets we seek to add value to our clients’ overall investments by lowering volatility raising the income level and enhancing total return portfolio strategy this portfolio as with all of our strategies is team managed we invest in stocks with solid financial strength investment grade or better and moderately steady growth our holdings have consistent and reliable business models and a history of high and rising dividends that we project will continue to grow we focus on essential services lowcost producers niche companies and companies with outstanding consistency in their earnings and dividends this helps ensure that return expectations are realistic and achievable stocks are sold when a company fails to increase dividends with no reasonable excuse there is deterioration in a companys fundamentals a stock exhibits extended overvaluation there is a negative impact from a regulatory decision or we need to make room for a more attractive investment strategy inception date june  portfolio manager mhi

institutional research firm providing quantitative and technical research on largecapitalization stocks to clients such as fidelity cigna usfg delta airlines john templeton george soros federal express and many others in  while investigating alternatives to traditional fixedincome vehicles we conducted a landmark study of the longterm returns of utilities as an asset class our research revealed the incomegenerating wealthbuilding potential of dividends over the long term based on these findings we began managing our first utilities portfolio in  founded on our philosophy that internal compounding high current dividend income plus dividend growth is the key to building longterm wealth we hold to the adage “slow and steady wins the race” founder lowell miller a leading expert on utilities energy and listed infrastructure as well as broad market dividendgrowth companies has been a keynote speaker and member of many industry panels has appeared on louis rukeysers wall treet week and bloomberg tv and is regularly quoted in the national financial media the strong investment team we have built has more than  years of combined investment experience our evolution has been significantly influenced by the results of our utility study and the concept of a repeatingbusiness model in may  we initiated the incomeequity strategy which expands that model to nearly all sectors of the market and emphasizes stable companies that have a high current yield rising dividend and that may contain a hidden “growth kicker” thats not built into the stocks price millerhoward

millerhoward investments inc a boutique asset management firm focused on incomeproducing equities and the entire energy vertical for more than  years our investment focus since inception has been on highquality companies that not only pay a high dividend yield but also have the potential to grow their dividends at abovemarket averages we seek both income and opportunities for growth of principal in a single investment our indexes seek to capture and distill all we have learned over nearly a quarter century of active management of dividend and energy infrastructure companies our strategic rulesbased indexes are created to enhance current passive approaches to asset allocation the indexes are designed to go beyond market exposure by applying persistent strategic factors we have observed and confirmed through our active management they find and retain the good as opposed to capweighted indexes which in our view hold the good the bad and the ugly—by their very nature and definition in addition to their everything but the kitchen sink approach traditional marketcapitalizationweighted indexes tend to overweight overvalued stocks that have appreciated in price millerhoward strategic indexes seeks to improve on this model by equal weighting and by limiting constituent selection to those companies that share distinct positive fundamental factors such as dividend growth yield
