why i believe isoray is overvalued by at least  from its current price  target  isoray inc nysemktisr  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»why i believe isoray is overvalued by at least  from its current price  targetmar  about isoray inc isr value investor right now longshort equity special situations momentumvalue investor right now on twittersummarythe stock has run upwards of  in a span of  trading days based on nothing of significancethe company most likely needs to raise additional capital so further dilution likelythe only covering analyst of isr maxim group still gives them a month  targeta few days ago a fellow seeking alpha writer sujan lahiri wrote an article on isoray inc isr which featured a very positive interview with the ceo dwight babcock of the company and furthermore it included personal optimistic observations about the stock it was published on march  when isorays stock price was trading below  at the start of the bullish article sujan lahiri said the following at current levels we think this stock is dramatically undervalued most investors do not even know this company exists and the handful investors who do know may not fully comprehend the story shares are currently trading at  but we think it should be trading at  as we speak this was not the first article that sujan lahiri did on isr one other one was written on september   and at that time isr shares were trading around  cents he gave then isoray inc a price target of  isoray inc shares then proceeded towards  cents over the next few days before slowly falling back to below  cents for most of december  as i am writing this article the stock price of isr is actually at  although there was news released on march  regarding the treatment of a pediatric patients tumor utilizing multiple cesium sutured seed meshes for internal radiation therapy it is my belief that isoray inc is way overvalued at these extreme levels and that it will again trade near the  to  per share levels once all this momentumdriven hoopla is done with and investors realize that they are not holders of some unique and disruptive medical technology isorays cesium product has been around since  thats when they got their fda approval and if one looks at the stock chart of how it has performed during the last  years one can see that it has not done much until of course the last couple of days technical chart analysis again as i write this isr is trading around  the relative strength index rsi on isr is nearly   this is not just extremely overbought its extremely extended here is an example of a few recent other highflying stocks that reached the rsi  levels i have circled in black the rsi for all three stocks at their peak and you can see what happened a few days later there were no secondarys or dilutions in any of these three stocks shown as examples in my  years of experience in the stock market i have learned that history repeats itself no matter what stock it is or the sector its in previous dilutions  outstanding warrants on august   isoray inc announced a secondary and warrants then the very next day they decided to change the warrants terms i wont bore you with the details as you can read both of the filings for concrete details the bottom line the company issued  million warrants with a strike price of  to be exercised directly and  million warrants with a strike price of  exercisable after  months those are now exercisable as of march   since the six months have passed but i do also want you to notice that at the bottom of both of the above press releases it is clearly stated that maxim group llc is acting as sole book runner in connection with the offering i promise much more on maxim group and their relationship with isoray medical which is coming up later in this article now please take a look at page  of the nd quarter formq filed you will see that there are still  million additional outstanding warrants as of december   that can be exercised from mostly under  during the years  in the march   sujan lahin article it is said on the balance sheet sits about  million cash  million in assets and no debt given the monthly cash burn of about  million we believe isoray is fully funded for at least  months this substantially diminishes any nearterm dilution risk if one checks page  of the nd quarter formq report it is clearly stated that the company had approximately  million of cash and cash equivalents and no shortterm investments as of february   so where does sujan lahiri get the  million number as its really just  million furthermore if you then look at the bottom of the same page again  page   of the q you will see this statement based on the foregoing assumptions management believes cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of approximately  million on hand at february   will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months assuming both revenue and expenses remain at current levels again sujan lahiri makes an incorrect claim in his article that they have  months of funds so the bottom line let me ask you if you are willing to raise money when your stock is trading at  cents do you think that the company will not want to use the opportunity  with the stock now more than  higher  to raise more cash and capital information from last q filed in the nd quarter formq filed  the total number of outstanding shares is being listed bottom of page  as  here are two other items of interest from the same form q page  management believes that the company will require additional equity investment to maintain its common stocks listing status on the nyse mkt page  failure to comply with nyse mkt listing standards and any resulting delisting could adversely affect the market for our common stock our common stock is presently listed on the nyse mkt the nyse mkt will consider delisting a companys securities if among other things the company fails to maintain minimum stockholders equity or the company has sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to its overall operations or its existing financial resources or its financial condition has become so impaired that it appears questionable in the opinion of the nyse mkt as to whether such issuer will be able to continue operations andor meet its obligations as they mature there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our listing on the nyse mkt indefinitely we anticipate falling below the minimum stockholders equity requirement for the quarter ended march   we may need to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated to meet listing standards if the warrants sold in august  are not exercised if we are unable to raise this capital our shares may become delisted maxim group  isr maxim group a tiny boutique firm started coverage of isoray inc on november    which was a couple of months after they were the only book runner  underwriter in connection with the offering that was done in late august  maxim group has done  equity research reports and here is the summation of each november   isr stock price  target price  january   isr stock price  target price  january   isr stock price  target price  february   isr stock price  target price  usually i am unable to provide you with a full copy of the report due to copyright but in this case isoray inc has put up a copy of it on their own website for free access here it is while reading it please note these two important points • maxim has never raised their target above  they are very clear in their last sentence of analysis our year dcf analysis supports a fair value of share we expect isoray to breakeven in  meaning stop losing money • please read carefully exactly what is written on page  under the disclosures of the same maxim groups february   equity research report on isoray inc maxim group managedcomanaged a public offering of the securities for isoray inc in the past  months maxim group expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from isoray inc in the next  months maxim group received compensation for investment banking services from isoray inc in the past  months maxim group makes a market in isoray inc so there you have it this underlined statement clearly shows that it is very possible that another dilution secondary offering or even more warrants could be forthcoming to shareholders of isoray inc and does maxim group think themselves that in isoray inc they found incredible disruptive potential or some unique product line that will now just takeoff and create huge sales just have a read  page   from maxim groups initiation of coverage report for isr from november  sluggish market uptake isr mostly relies on early adopters among surgeons to expand its brachytherapy market in nonprostate cancer indications success with the early adopters may not lead to wider adoption in the medical community doctors may have their own preferences when choosing treatmentsa decision that could be driven by multiple factors such as personal interpretation of safety andor efficacy both proxcelan and gliasite lack wellcontrolled clinical trials to support their safety and efficacy claims technicality issues and reimbursement issues in addition extra regulatory requirements associated with radioactive materials could delay penetration to the hospitals and clinics sluggish market uptake of these products may lead to lowerthanexpected revenue growth competition in addition to the competing products we mentioned in the above discussion traditional surgery robotic surgery external radiation and chemotherapy could all compete against brachytherapy we believe this competition explains the loss of share in prostate cancer brachytherapy in recent years these same therapeutic alternatives are likely to compete in the nonprostate cancer applications opinion of others independent analysis of isr monstrous runup has brought out the following public commentary • thestreetcom wrote an analysis on march   and gave isr a sell with a ratings score of d• adam feuerstein a senior columnist and leading expert on biotechs made the following comment on march    after the market had closed on his official twitter account in response to a question from a colleague isr move seems wildly disproportionate to significance of todays news but isnt this what noname stocks do all the time that comment was made when the stock closed at  again it is now  conclusion i think that what isoray inc is doing for sick people is wonderful its great that a year old boy might be given a better chance to survive i have no qualms about the moral side of their company but when it comes to valuing a company it has nothing to do with what the company does all that matters is growth potential revenue and eps i dont smoke and i hate having smokers around me but did i ever short phillip morris nysepm another example is that if i like krispy kreme kkd doughnuts that doesnt mean i should run out and buy the company stock the significant problem that i have with isoray inc is their current valuation based on their current stock price i strongly believe that it is way overvalued based on current earningseps as long as it is trading anywhere over a  i can even live with the  month  target that maxim group rightfully their biggest cheerleader has given them again i ask to you please read their report and realize that this  target is a  drop from the current price levels that isr is trading at if there is anything else which is eyeopening for me please go back to the article that sujan lahiri wrote and locate the interview with the ceo sujan lahiri asks the ceo dwight babcock a direct question and gets a direct answer question what do you think isoray is actually worth today dwight babcock ceo i believe easily  per share so the ceo himself thinks that the isr should be valued at  the median of his range we all know how ceos always think that their companies are undervalued and given that this would be his high estimate it again brings me back to the  to  level as the rightful number until isoray starts improving their revenue and eps numbers on a personal note i should also add that in my opinion when a ceo explicitly touts a fair price or price range for his companys stock for me its always a major red flag to do such a thing again in my opinion is inappropriate if not unethical there have been a few microcap biotech stocks that had these astronomical shooting stars during the last couple of months almost all of them soon gave back at least  to  from their peak prices and i see exactly the same thing happening to isr when the momentum players leave in addition i am a strong believer that some kind of dilution is forthcoming and that will speedup the downward spiral of isoray inc stock price there is just no logical reason

have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using
