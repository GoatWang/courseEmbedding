key to enhancing super   mercer has announced the launch of an innovative investment option expected to provide a solution to weaknesses in australia’s current retirement income system according to mercer’s latest research  per cent of australians expected to have less money than they needed for the lifestyle they desired in retirement while one in four australians would outlive their retirement savings by more than  years yesterday media super and vicsuper were revealed as the first two industry funds set to take on mercer’s new longevity solution product lifetimeplus early next quarter the company said its investment option was the world’s first pooled mortality investment fund designed to protect more australians against the risk of outliving their savings mercer managing director and pacific market leader david anderson said retirement would be a financial challenge for many “life might be simple but comfortable for the first decade or so but once savings run out the age pension will only provide about half the amount required for a ‘comfortable lifestyle’ according to asfa association of superannuation funds of australia” anderson said vicsuper chief executive michael dundon said he was impressed to witness such an innovative product development happening in the retirement income space “to ensure our members can maintain their desired lifestyles in retirement we believe we must provide appropriate solutions which manage the risks they face as well as providing for their income needs” dundon said “an adviserled incomelayering approach to building a member’s retirement portfolio can provide the best outcome for our members “using an innovative product suite is fundamental to this approach” lifetimeplus is expected to be primarily delivered to consumers via financial advisers since circumstances upon entering the longevity investment including a member’s age and superannuation account balance will directly determine the product’s suitability effectiveness and productivity of their returns mercer senior partner and senior actuary david knox said the investor must have a retirement pension in order to enter the shared pooled investment knox explained that what differentiated the option from others was that it was deliberately biased towards those who lived longest in order to give those members the sustained confidence that they would have enough savings to maintain their lifestyle until they died apart from assessing the suitability of the product for each investor on a casebycase basis advisers will also be responsible for delivering imperative product information to members anderson said despite lifetimeplus initially only being delivered by financial planners it could be expected to evolve over time become a retail fund and eventually have the potential to be made directly available to consumers « back to articles industry highlights hub recruits btfg exec afa announces new ceo as fox steps down perpetual hires longtime

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
