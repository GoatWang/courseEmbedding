an effective hybrid monte carlodeterministic implementation typically requires the approximation of a continuous geometry description with a discretized piecewiseconstant material field the inherent geometry discretization error can be reduced somewhat by using material mixing where multiple materials inside a discrete mesh voxel are homogenized material mixing requires the construction of a mix table which stores the volume fractions in every mixture so that multiple voxels with similar compositions can reference the same mixture mix table construction is a potentially expensive serial operation for large problems with many materials and voxels we formulate an efficient algorithm to construct a sparse mix table inmore » otext solver with pinhomogenized cross section generation is
