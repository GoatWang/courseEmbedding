msp fund objective msp has a primary objective of obtaining a high level of current income and gains with a secondary objective of achieving longterm capital appreciation we believe these goals can be met by investing in large and midcapitalizations stocks that are in our opinion selling at a reasonable price with respect to their longterm earnings growth rates the income comes in the form option premiums which are generated by writing covered calls on a majority of stocks in the portfolio investment strategies msp will invest in stocks within certain economic sectors that in our opinion are the most attractive for our �growthatareasonable price� style of investing in current market conditions it is our belief that these sectors provide opportunities for higher option premiums than call options on stocks in other sectors msp�s sector concentration has most often fallen in the following four areas consumer discretionary and retail technology medicalhealth and pharmaceutical financial

income and gains with a secondary objective of achieving longterm capital appreciation we believe these goals can be met by investing in large and midcapitalizations stocks that are in our opinion selling at a reasonable price with respect to their longterm earnings growth rates the income comes in the form option premiums which are generated by writing covered calls on a majority of stocks in the portfolio investment strategies msp will invest in stocks within certain economic sectors that in our opinion are the most attractive for our �growthatareasonable price� style of investing in current market conditions it is our belief that these sectors provide opportunities for higher option premiums than call options on stocks in other sectors msp�s sector concentration has most often
