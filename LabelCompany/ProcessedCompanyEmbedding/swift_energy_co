renewable energy threatens swift energys business model in the long run  adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes can potentially devastate swift energys louisiana and texas operations  competition  references swift energy is the largest producer of crude oil in the state of louisiana the company has become predominantly an oil producer with oil constituting  of its  domestic production natural gas constituting  of production and natural gas liquids ngls constituting  like many operators of oil and natural gas properties in the us swift energy reported a large loss in  and in the first quarter of  totaling  million and  million respectively the unprofitability of swift energys business was caused by the sharp declines in energy prices in  the aggregate average price of energy including both oil and natural gas decreased  from  per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of  to  in the first quarter of  swift energy earns higher revenue on oil and natural gas sold when energy prices are high so the sharp decline in prices in  and into  substantially reduced the companys revenue the company also decreased its production volume by  in  to  mmboe million barrels of oil equivalent due to lower oil and natural gas demand the fall in demand for crude oil is tied to the  credit crunch the  financial crisis and the ensuing recession when the demand for crude oil fell in the second half of  oil prices fell from a record high of about  per barrel to around  a barrel in the first quarter of  however nymex crude oil has stabilized around the  range up from its february low of about  rising oil prices are caused by a variety of factors including a weak us dollar usd opec production quotas and the rising demand for energy in emerging markets such as china and india while oil and gas dominate the worlds supply of energy alternative energies such as wind energy solar energy and geothermal energy pose a longterm threat to the oil industry and to swift energys business at the same time fossil fuels are estimated to account for  to  of global energy supply in  and the comparatively low price of crude oil does not favor the economics of renewable energy though government subsidies are helping to spur the adoption of alternative energy company overview swift energy manages the development of its oil wells and supervises well operations and maintenance the company does not own drilling rigs instead independent contractors are hired to provide drilling equipment and personnel swift energy employs drilling production and reservoir engineers geologists and other specialists who work to improve production rates increase reserves and lower the cost of operating oil and natural gas properties swift energy does not refine oil or process natural gas once oil and natural gas are extracted from swift energys wells the company sells these commodities to other energy companies on the open market the vast majority of swift energys sales are to two oil majors royal dutch shell rdsa and chevron corporation cvx shell accounted for approximately  of swift energys gross oil and gas sales in  while chevron accounted for  no other oil company accounted for more than  of oil and gas sales for the past two years oil produced by swift energy is moved from drilling sites via crude oil pipelines barges and trucks natural gas is usually delivered to el paso’s tennessee gas pipeline system and then sold on the spot market business and financial metrics first quarter  performance swift energy announced earnings for the first quarter of  million compared to a net loss of  million in the yearago quarter swift energy produced  million barrels of oil equivalent during the first quarter of  a  decrease compared to first quarter  production first quarter production decreased as a result of limited new drilling activity freezing problems due to unusually colder temperatures in louisiana and unplanned equipment repairs at lake washington total revenues for the first quarter increased  to  million due to higher commodity prices effect of the global recession and credit crisis rapidly falling prices for oil and natural gas beginning in the third quarter of  had a significant impact on swift energys cash flows capital expenditures and liquidity oil and natural gas prices continued to decline during the fourth quarter of  leading to a  decline in average prices when compared to average prices received in the third quarter of  swift energy has taken the following steps to mitigate the effects of the recession  capital expenditures were budgeted at  million down from  million in  the company reduced its workforce by   employees to lower general and administrative costs the company adjusted its

swift energy closed the sale of all of its new zealand assets for  million as a result of the sale a third party brought a lawsuit against swift energy for breach of a contract related to obtaining their consent to transfer the permit pending the outcome of the litigation swift energy deferred the potential gain on the permit sale key trends and forces weak demand for oil and natural gas and falling energy prices limit swift energys revenues and profitability the us energy information administration eia reported that consumption in  of refined products in the united states declined by nearly  percent from the  average representing the largest annual decline since  this decline following recordhigh retail gas prices and crude oil prices during the first half of the year was prompted by the severe economic downturn in the second half of the year however the eia now projects that the world oil consumption will grow by  million barrels per day bbld in  which would lead to an increase of about  per barrel in eias projections for west texas intermediate wti crude oil spot prices eia expects wti prices to average about  per barrel during the second half of this year rising to  by the end of next year to date energy production shipments and prices have not been significantly affected by the oil spill following the april  explosion aboard the deepwater horizon drilling rig and its subsequent loss in the gulf of mexico  miles off the louisiana coast the rise of renewable energy threatens swift energys business model in the long run alternative energy has not been widely adopted because it is not yet economically feasible when compared to cheap plentiful fossil fuels however if energy sources such as solar or wind become more economically sound the negative impact on the oil and gas industry will be immense specifically swift energys revenue is driven by the demand for oil and natural gas by oil companies such as chevron corporation cvx if the demand for fossil fuels is eventually replaced by the demand for alternative energy swift energys revenue will decline substantially although infrastructure is being installed for renewable energy and solar power and wind energy are advancing on the technological front the fall in oil prices after july  has put the economics of renewable energy into question with energy once again cheap and plentiful the imperative to develop renewable energy has weakened on the other hand concern over global climate change has continued to rise increasing government support for renewable energy grants and subsidies for example president obama called for the us to double its use of renewable energy by  as part of his plan to stimulate the economy and pull the country out of recession his plan which includes up to  billion over two years in subsidies and tax cuts for renewable energy energy efficiency and electric grid modernization projects has the potential to pull the industry out of the slump caused by the  financial crisis moreover obama pushed through a stimulus plan that earmarks  billion for green projects including  billion in renewable energy loan guarantees and bonds as well as grants of up to  for businesshomeowner investments in renewables a further  billion has been earmarked for energy efficiency  bn for efficient power grid expansion  billion for clean energy research and  billion for hybrid cars while oil and gas dominate the worlds supply of energy alternative energies such as wind energy solar energy and geothermal energy pose a longterm threat to the oil industry on the other hand some research institutes forecast that fossil fuels will account for  to  of global energy supply in  it is clear that fossil fuels are essential to the functioning of the global economy suggesting the intermediateterm viability of swift energys business model but the prospect of a transition to alternative energy threatens it in the longrun adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes can potentially devastate swift energys louisiana and texas operations approximately  of swift energys  reserves and  of its  production are located in its south louisiana and southeast louisiana core areas these areas are vulnerable to hurricanes during the atlantic hurricane season which runs from june  to november  increased hurricane activity between  and  resulted in lower production and physical damage to swift energys operations for example a significant percentage of the companys production was shut down by hurricanes katrina and rita in  and by hurricanes gustav and ike in  in  production decreased  to  mmboe as a result of production shutins necessitated by hurricanes gustav and then ike additionally the effects of the hurricanes were felt through the third and fourth quarters as the drilling and completion of several wells were delayed as the company moved drilling rigs into safe harbor before the hurricanes and then had to return them to the field hurricane ike in midseptember caused damage to several fields in the companys south louisiana core area and its high island field due to high water levels swift energy estimates that the total cost for the replacement of assets repairs and cleanup costs related to hurricanes gustav and ike primarily in the bay de chene field were approximately  million competition although the oil industry is
