potential golden queen mining proposes an aggregate and construction materials business that will be developed once the heap leach operation is in full production based on the location of the project in southern california with close proximity to major highways and railway lines the california department of transportation projects aggregate demand of approximately  million tons per year for the area surrounding palmdale lancaster and rosamond and less than  of this demand can be met from existing permitted resources similarly estimates suggests that demand from the area surrounding bakersfield is approximately  million tons per year for the next  years and less than  of this demand can be met from existing permitted resources california updated its analysis of permitted aggregate reserves compared with year projected aggregate demand in  the analysis is available at wwwconsrvcagovcgsinformationpublicationsmsdocumentsmspdf and the accompanying map of aggregate supply

senate bill  requires the california department of transportation to use recycled aggregates in state paving projects where economical in this instance the waste rock from the project would constitute a recycled waste product consistent with senate bill  aggregate production from waste rock research suggests that up to  million tons of waste rock could be sold into the southern california aggregates market annually the source of raw materials will be quality waste rock stockpiled on a level pad east of the east pit the waste rock can be classified into a range of products such as riprap crushed stone and sand with little further processing every effort will be made to proceed with processing of the waste rock as early in the life of the mine as possible and it is expected that this can proceed shortly after the start of preproduction mining closing reclamation of the facilities required for the processing of waste rock including the storage pad will remain the company’s responsibility an economic advantage there are three key elements that should create advantages for the company as an aggregate producer the runofmine waste rock and sand will be produced as a byproduct from a mining operation this should give the project an economic advantage as an aggregate producer in comparison with producers that have to mine rock or obtain sand from alluvial deposits to produce aggregate available infrastructure on site will have an important impact on the cost of producing aggregate and shipping aggregate or final products to market it has become difficult to obtain permits for new quarry developments in southern california the project has its permits in place and this should be a distinct advantage for an aggregate producer that wishes to work with the company as a subcontractor on site or as partner in a bulk concrete products facility on site it is important to note that no contributions from the sale of aggregate products will be
