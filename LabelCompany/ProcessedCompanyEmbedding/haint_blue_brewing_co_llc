managing director of madison dearborn partners meet our mobilian investors located near the port of mobile downtown and just off interstate we will truly be mobiles front porch this is why we turned to crowdfunding—we wanted to give mobilians the opportunity to join in this addition to the great city that is mobile we have received tremendous support and an outpour of positivity from the community and citizens who are excited about what we are building lets have a toast it’s true that we love beer but we’re more in love with what beer can do it’s the official drink of human emotion we consume it when we want to celebrate a friend’s engagement honor a fallen comrade or reward ourselves for an honest day’s hard work sometimes we simply yearn for  o’ clock somewhere in terms of being a beer company it’s important that we love our lot community and country after spending over a decade in us army special operations i am no longer ignorant to the impact each one of us can have on the world i intend for haint blue to accept the challenge of being a contributing brewery of society we have taken on this challenge your investment will do more than build a brewery it will breathe life into a century old southern ice house that has been vacant for decades our beer will always be ice cold when you drink our beer you will have an opportunity to fight terrorism from the sidelines you see we brew two beers with saffron grown in the mountains of afghanistan we obtain this spice from a veteran owned company that is striving to turn opium growers into saffron farmers an initiative that could ultimately stymie the financing of terrorist organizations wefunder’s mission of “putting humanity back into capitalism” is perfectly aligned with our company’s values why shouldn’t anyone be able to invest in the things they care about funding in this way regulation crowdfunding is currently described as nontraditional and sometimes considered a waste of time by the status quo…we think they’re wrong let’s build mobile’s brewery and taproom together after all we each have an opportunity to become a mobilianaire  mobile was born to celebrate join me on the porch for a pint and in

investors more investors details expand all what is haint blue brewing company haint blue brewing company aims to be the first microbrewery since prohibition in mobile there’s been a couple of brew pubs but they were more restaurants that happened to make beer instead of breweries who might happen to have food if that makes any sense we couldnt even have a brew pub here until the nineties the law changed and only recently in  we can now self distribute as breweries up to a certain amount of ounces we could actually send you home with a growler all this is new we see it as a new market opportunity and as a brand we want to be a mobile home town brewery whats new about what youre making how is it different its made with love in mobile alabama so yes we offer domestic beers we are mobiles only microbrewery in a city of nearly  people our beers are brewed with water from an onsite wellthey cant be easily replicated spoiler alert we found a way to fight terrorism with beer the secret is in the sauce what do you understand about your business that others dont get craft beer is all about people it breaks down barriers casts inhibitions to the wind fosters new relationships and lubricates the gears of many friendships it gives people a break from the real world a chance to relax and instills a certain de bon aire it can transform a chuckle into a laugh and a laugh into a guffaw with all of the wonderment that craft beer provides enthusiasts and patrons haint blue brewing company has the opportunity of being the catalyst to many of the things people enjoy most in life perhaps a pint of haint blue may even receive the distinction of being the toast to honor someone or provide thespark to a celebration who wouldnt want to be apart of that how big is the market according to the brewers association the craft beer is a  billion market sales of craft beer for  were up  and exported craft beer sales were up  for  while those are national numbers and we are focusing on our immediate market initially there is tremendous future growth opportunity in addition to the national statistics alabama is th in production and th in the union in terms of breweries per capita we aim to change that who are your competitors how are you different currently there is not a microbrewery in the city of mobile the closest brewery is located across the bay by definition haint blue brewing company with be the first microbrewery and taproom in the city of mobile since prohibition the companys production facilities are located in the historic crystal ice house built and ran by  generations of mobile’s own quinlivan family the quinlivans still serve the local community and stand willing to build a strong relationship with our company the building is brimming with character and is located in the historic church street east neighborhood in addition to being in the center of a lively quaint neighborhood we have a connection with the citys eccentric buried kin our historic ice house  modern brewery is bordered by an th century graveyard mobiles ultimate party guy joe cain is buried in the back yard if the former wasnt enough to cause your hair to stand up we are located along the route for mobiles best celebrations mardi gras and the azalea trail run but wait theres more we are a rock’s throw from the historic oakleigh neighborhood and callaghan’s irish social club local certainly supports local small breweries create a culture were giving a reason for people to visit mobile as a region existing breweries and new entrants dont necessarily stymie are effort we dont simply view them as competitors but as allies in a heavily regulated industry  we even see opportunities to collaborate how will you make money haint blue brewing company will generate revenue through two primary sources of income the first is through traditional distribution channels our second source of revenue will be through beer sales in our onsite taproom we will of course generate revenue through other income producing efforts such as brewery tours hosting of private events apparel novelty item sales and special event ticket sales how did you get started ive always loved beer honestly the only reason i do any physical activity is so i can drink more beer i love the people who share my passion i spent  years in the us army a decade of which was in special operations as a  ranger medevac uha pilot and oth soar mhg pilot while my previous employment was a good time i was ready to take a knee and drink beer so the journey began the last twelve months has included brewing as a student at a colorado brewerytasting the finest beers in places like asheville portland seattle brussels and london all of the knowledge gained on the former trips has been put into to practice with my head brewer and friend matt wheeler additionally ive managed to compliment my special operations experience and ironclad stomach for risk with a real business education ive attended stanford gsbs ignite program due to depart soon for an entrepreneurial course at cornell and i am a parttime student pursuing an mba at the college of william  mary why mobile well im a native of mobiles state i came home to be near family after serving in the military traveling the country and exploring the globe i came to mobile for a midtour rr from afghanistan in  side bara mobilian bought me a beer the first i had in months on the connection flight from atlanta to mobile once here i remember going for a run the next morning down the streets and sidewalks of which were lined with live oak trees that wereare older than alabama ive been in love ever since seriously i may be a bona fide mobile tree hugger in terms of a business decision mobile has zero breweries and a culture that can sustain one what are you building at the time of this writing our production facility the historic crystal ice house is nothing more than a dot along the trail of the souths abandoned ice plants we want to breathe life into this building and invite our patrons in its important that we are careful in upfitting this property careful not to erase the character of the building with that being said it wont be cheap with your investment we will make a functioning brewery of modern society that lends a nod to its history what’s special about your location our location is perfect we locked down a century old ice house which is something also very southern theres early th century ice plants all over the south its also bordered on two sides by the church street east graveyard so we have our own resident spirits there a lot of eccentric characters from the region joe cain the father of mardi gras and kind of a mobile renaissance man eugene walters are buried there weve got a lot of bike traffic that comes by due to the tunnel being open on saturday mornings its also on the mardi gras parade route which is essentially a beer drinking holiday the azalea trail run route runs right by the brewerywe are right in the heart of two historic districts so theres also quite a bit of foot traffic we are on the edge of downtown so its a dense area in terms of population were not far from the interstate as well but we dont have a view of the interstate which is great the property itself is  square feet so initially we wanted to carve out  square feet for a tap room we have a lot of room for organic growth there are outdoor entertaining opportunities and areas to add additional revenue streams eg whether it be music or weddings were very deliberate nothings on accident we care about every single detail from the beer to the space to the message to the logo were very much mobiles brewery and i hope to bring something new with a nod to history because thats what makes this place unique i dont want to paint over everything in our building i want to highlight its history what ideas do you have for growth in the next months my projection is that well produce  barrels
