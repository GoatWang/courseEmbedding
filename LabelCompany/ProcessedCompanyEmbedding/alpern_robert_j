pathophysiology in this th edition such new and powerful disciplines as genetics and cell biology have been deployed to deepen and widen further the explanatory framework not only have previous chapters been extensively updated but new chapters have been added to incorporate additional disciplines individual chapters for example now provide detailed treatment of the significance of cilia the role of stem cells is now given special consideration finally there has been a significant expansion of the section of pathophysiology incorporating the newer findings of cell biology and genetics if

electrolyte and water metabolism has expanded enormously this new edition of the kidney illuminates these basic science principles clearly and thoroughly while also providing comprehensive and clear clinical management this edition has been thoroughly revised and updated tight editing and rigorous revision of the chapters along with elimination of redundancy have enabled us to return to a twovolume work at more than  pages with over  illustrations and hundreds of tables the kidney remains highly recommended for anyone active in renal research or clinical nephrologythe clinical investigator vol  no  show more about robert j alpern dr alpern has performed research in the area of epithelial physiology focusing on the mechanisms and regulation of acid transport he received his
