equity deal of the year as part of the iflr  america awards mcdermott files us supreme court amicus brief on behalf of the american bar association regarding sixth amendment rights of criminal defendants mcdermott represented the american bar association aba by filing an amicus curiae brief in the us supreme court in jae lee v united states urging the court to reverse the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit in a case regarding the scope of sixth amendment protections for immigrant defendants in criminal cases jae lee v united states is an appeal of a sixth circuit ruling that a longtime legal permanent resident and businessman who pled guilty to a firsttime drug offense should be deported even though his lawyer incorrectly assured him that his guilty plea would not lead to his deportation mr lee emigrated from south korea with his family in  as a yearold boy and has lived legally in the united states for decades in  the successful restaurateur was charged with possession of ecstasy with intent to distribute based on his lawyer’s assurances that his years living legally in the united states his strong familial and business ties to this country and his lack of a criminal history made it “impossible” for him to be deported mr lee pleaded guilty when mr lee learned that his lawyer was wrong he sought to vacate his conviction claiming ineffective assistance of counsel however a federal judge in tennessee concluded there was no prejudice because a decision to proceed to trial would have almost certainly resulted in a guilty verdict a longer prison sentence and deportation the sixth circuit affirmed the federal courts of appeal have disagreed about whether such defendants who receive bad legal advice and plead guilty  not knowing that their pleas will lead to deportation  are prejudiced by such ineffective assistance of counsel when there is strong evidence of guilt the aba brief cites among other authorities the aba standards for criminal justice with respect to a lawyer’s duty to provide competent representation – including the duty to advise a noncitizen defendant about immigration consequences during plea negotiations the brief argues that a defendant who is deprived of competent legal advice about whether a conviction carries a risk of deportation can be prejudiced notwithstanding the evidence of guilt because he cannot make a voluntary and informed korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter decision about whether or not to accept a plea offer and because he is deprived of the ability to negotiate a more favorable plea agreement in the first place the amicus brief was written by mcdermott partners a marisa chun of our silicon valley office and paul m thompson of our washington dc office and associates

an entity engaged in us interstate commerce transactional parties should evaluate the benefits of voluntarily notifying cfius in advance of completing any covered transactions while doing so may generate additional costs and might delay closing failing to obtain prior cfius approval may require a deal to be restructured or even unwound in addition with only a few exceptions once a transaction passes cfius review it may not be reinvestigated relative to an entire transactions costs the time and legal fees associated with voluntary review are a small and important investment it is therefore no surprise that there has been a noticeable increase in the number of deals voluntarily submitted for cfius review – from  in  to  in  the last year covered by a cfius annual report to congress the cfius process a cfius review may be initiated through a voluntary written notice jointly filed by the transactional parties or directly by cfius at any point during the transaction even postclosing the cfius review process has a strict timetable beginning with a  day review followed if necessary by a  day investigation and  day us presidential review cfius examines factors pertaining to us national defence us technological leadership us critical infrastructure resources and technologies control of the foreign acquirer by a foreign government and adherence by the acquirer to us export control requirements cfius considers these factors in light of the parties’ government contracts cyber security practices supply chain features and the proximity of business operations and property to us government facilities “critical infrastructures and resources” include vital systems and assets physical or virtual the incapacity or destruction of which would have a debilitating impact on national physical or economic security andor public health or safety “critical technologies” may include either defence or other exportcontrolled technology cfius may examine whether or not the us target has classified contracts with the us government or technology that is subject to export controls or needed for national defence parties filing a voluntary notice are well advised to allow for adequate prenotice time and to prepare the notice at the same time as drafting transactional agreements and conducting due diligence they should establish responsibilities among personnel and agree on the process for preparing the notice and for dealing with cfius parties should also agree whether or not to include deal terms contingent on the outcome of the cfius review it is important for parties to engage in a dialogue with cfius prior to filing the materials needed for the review since the  day review clock starts ticking only after cfius staff determines that the joint notice is sufficient parties should initiate an informal discussion with cfius staff and work cooperatively with them to ensure the notice is complete and to address all of cfius’ questions if at the end of the day review all cfius members conclude that the transaction poses no threat to us national security cfius notifies the parties that it does not intend to take further action and the deal is cleared alternatively cfius may begin a  day investigation at the conclusion of which if cfius finds that the transaction is not a national security threat the transaction is cleared if cfius concludes that the transaction does threaten national security it may ask the parties to restructure the transaction to mitigate the threat or in rare cases may recommend to the president of the united states that the transaction be prohibited or suspended korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter cfius trends the cfius process has been criticized for its complicated nature amorphous definitions and lack of transparency regardless of the criticism cfiusreviewed transactions have increased dramatically in recent years from  cfius notices  investigations and two notice withdrawals in  to  cfius reviews  investigations and nine notice withdrawals in  it is unclear whether the increase in cfius reviews merely correlates with an increase in crossborder transactions from  foreign acquisitions of us targets in  to  in  or whether it reflects a unique rise in cfiusbased concerns ie national security under either scenario reported trends may help in deciding whether or not to seek review from  to  china accounted for

reviews as confidential and does not publish transactionspecific information the information released by transaction parties and news reports does however help illustrate some key factors considered by cfius that have resulted in deal terminations or mitigations these include consideration of whether or not an acquisition of a us fibre optic network posed a risk to the security of us data transmission and increased the possibility of foreign wiretaps an acquisition of an oil company could impact us energy supplies a foreign acquirer was associated with its countrys military us property proposed for acquisition was located close to sensitive us military installation and recently whether or not the acquisition of mobile data software applications posed risks of breaches of date

review korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter coordinating the effective date of mergers in a globalpost acquisition integration john huang shanghai tom conaghan washington dc andreas kurtze frankfurt nicolas lafont paris giovanni nicchiniello milan roy zhu shanghai paolo cocchini milan anna steudner frankfurt calum thom london joe williams washington dc negotiating a business combination with a large global competitor is a complicated process and the complications do not necessarily end at the closing of the deal the primary focus of postacquisition integration projects is to eliminate redundant legal and operational structures duplicated legal entities mean duplicate costs including taxation human resources and the basic operational and legal costs of maintaining the separate entities redundant legal entities can also lead to market confusion the other main area of concern is the coordination of the timing of the business combination to ensure the following being in place the day the merger comes into effect  the two companies should be ready from an operational perspective to start acting like a single company eg pitching for work and processing payroll  supplier and customer contracts from the redundant entity transferred to the surviving acquirer entity  the licenses and regulatory approvals needed to affect the transfer of the redundant entity’s business to the surviving acquirer entity  the legal transfer of employees and employment insurance the company will also prefer to have the legal effective date of the merger coincide with the effective date of the merger from a tax and accounting perspective the global picture in the united states the primary means for eliminating a redundant target legal entity is to merge it out of existence us merger law is very accommodating and flexible which results in a clean transfer of the assets and liabilities of the redundant entity into the acquirers legal structure these mergers can often be structured as taxfree reorganisations under the us federal income tax law timing is also very manageable in the united states as most states permit mergers to be effected within a single day many global companies discover that in other jurisdictions however it is not possible to achieve these objectives when combining redundant and surviving entities through mergers or similar transactions in many countries including austria china finland germany sweden and switzerland the “legal” effective date of the merger is tied to the date the merger is officially “registered” in the local commercial registry which relies to a large extent on the actions or inactions of certain commercial courts and regulators in practice in certain countries including austria finland germany sweden and switzerland the company’s “preferred” legal effective date may be requested and is ordinarily respected by the commercial registry in italy provided that the merger is by acquisition a company merging with and into another existing company with all assets and liabilities transferring to the surviving company the effective date can be postponed until the date on which the deed of merger has been filed with the competent local commercial registry the italian civil code provides simplified rules for mergers of a company that is fully owned by the absorbing entity which can help to eliminate redundant entities in china however the legal effective date of the merger is the date determined by the local commercial registry eg shanghai or beijing which has complete discretion for this reason many business combinations in china that start as legal “mergers” often end as a transfer of assets and liabilities given the greater flexibility in determining the effective timing korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter not all jurisdictions provide for statutory mergers for example in the united kingdom the process of combining the operations of a redundant legal entity after a business combination is more often accomplished through a transfer of assets and liabilities followed by the liquidation of the redundant entity although france does provide for a statutory merger many companies often choose to follow the transmission universelle de patrimoine tup process instead of a merger the tup process allows for a relatively expedited and straightforward transfer of assets and liabilities and the liquidation of the redundant entity coordinating legal effectiveness with accounting effectiveness some jurisdictions do differentiate between legal and accounting effectiveness raising planning issue that companies should discuss with their auditors certain countries such as germany and spain require the merging companies to submit financial statements alongside a request for merger approval in germany the “accounting effective date” of the merger will be the closing date of the balance sheet of the redundant entity filed with the commercial register which will precede the legal effective date in spain the “accounting effective date” will be the first day of the fiscal year in which the merger was approved korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter crossborder direct investing mark selinger new york as the midmarket private company transaction market heats up family office investors will find themselves competing for deals with strategic acquirers and private equity funds not to mention independent sponsors and other family office investors who have entered the market in recent years this may compel some of the most sophisticated investors to look abroad for investment opportunities investing abroad is not however for the weak of heart while unusual opportunities may indeed be available at attractive valuations conducting the due diligence and implementing and operating those opportunities present unique and for some unsurmountable challenges there are those investors who say that cultural considerations are overrated and that in the increasingly flat interconnected world we live in analysing a crossborder transaction is no different than a domestic transaction this may be the case as far as financial models are concerned but an excel spreadsheet cannot tell you how your actions will be perceived in a different culture be present family office investors may have an advantage over strategic acquirers and investment funds in crossborder mid market deals many target companies will themselves be familycontrolled businesses and may take comfort from a transaction with another familycontrolled entity as opposed to an institutional acquirer private equity funds in particular have a bit of a bad name in europe these days to capitalise on this advantage a family office investor must make it clear that it is different from an institutional investor in particular by connecting not just with the seller but with senior management employees and other constituencies such as local government officials a willingness to meet in the target’s home jurisdiction and to spend time there rather than just flying in and out helps establish credibility after the transaction is closed some senior managers may secretly want the new owners to stay far away from the company but seasoned investors know that a portfolio company investment cannot be managed entirely from afar in many countries a business enterprise is expected to reflect the owner’s values and ultimately this can’t be accomplished if the owner is hidden from view or poorly represented by a local partner or senior management this may require some family investors who cherish their privacy and prefer to remain in the background to leave their comfort zone because what would be considered a midmarket deal in the united states is often a very big deal in a nonus jurisdiction you can expect local newspaper articles tv and radio coverage and other unwanted attention also in some cultures particularly if the investment is in a strategic or culturally significant industry a foreign investor can be seen as foreign interloper or worse all the more reason therefore to establish personal credibility and maintain a strong local presence choose a local partner you can trust whether it is someone who is familiar with the company a local attorney accountant business advisor or coinvestor having a local presence who is both respected by the portfolio company and trusted by you is a major asset for a successful investment know your management even with a local presence there is nothing that will cause a crossborder investment to succeed or fail so much as the quality of the management team you must be confident that the management team shares your family office’s values philosophy and vision because it will be the management who will be entrusted with implementing your strategy and presenting your public face without a trusting relationship complemented with regular visits and communication the foreign investor may be seen as a distant somewhat malign force this perception can quickly spread through the company and poison the relationship between you and your management cross border direct investing can be an exhilarating and profitable experience but it must be entered into knowledgably with korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter experienced advisors and partners as direct investing becomes an increasingly common part of many family office portfolios crossborder direct investing will no doubt become an active and competitive investment area in the years to come korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter the rising popularity of ma transactions in the life sciences sector emmanuelle trombe paris rachel monjou paris botox and viagra would have made a perfect match but the us treasury stepped in to tighten up us tax laws and put a hold on what was expected to be the largest ma deal in the history of life sciences and also the biggest tax “inversion” ever attempted this cancelled merger brought life sciences ma into the limelight but this was welldeserved as  was a prolific year for the sector while  was characterized by a large number of ma deals across all industries the life sciences sector had the largest share why is ma so popular there are a number of reasons why when compared with other heavilyregulated and researchoriented sectors such as oil gas or automotive so many ma dea ls have recently occurred in the life sciences sector the most obvious reason is the “patent cliff” the number of very profitable blockbuster pharmaceutical products is diminishing as a result of key patents reaching their expiration date which leads to decreased profits resulting from the entry into the market of generics that new medicines often target narrower segments of population meaning their potential market is relatively small as a result even if the rd stage is successful it is uncertain how profitable these new medicines will be as a result when pharmaceutical companies find it difficult to innovate or lack the resources to fund rd they buy products that are at a less risky stage the sellers are often smaller companies that have specific expertise in rd but have no late stage development or commercialization expertise or do not have the financial capability to fund it types of deals two specific types of ma transaction have seen an increase in recent years the selective acquisition of strategic businesses and the divestiture of noncore businesses a number of these transactions have been implemented through asset swaps this trend is illustrated by glaxosmithkline’s swap of oncology assets in exchange for novartis’ vaccine division and sanofi’s contemplated trading of merial its animalhealth unit for boehringer’s consumer health care business these asset swaps often create opportunities for other transactions for example when divestitures are required as a clearance condition by antitrust authorities as part of its transaction with glaxosmithkline novartis had to divest two of its late development stage immuneoncology products encorafenib and binimetinib to array pharmaceuticals which in turn entered into an agreement for the development and commercialisation of these products in europe with pierre fabre in order to refocus on their core businesses pharmaceutical companies have also tended to outsource manufacturing and even to some extent early rd and to divest noncore programmes into spinout companies which may be financed by investors these trends multiply opportunities for ma and other type of transactions licensing and collaboration by far the most popular transactions in life sciences however are still licensing and collaboration  per cent of externally sourced pipeline value comes from codevelopment joint ventures and licensing while only  per cent from “pure” ma the number of licensing and collaboration deals has dramatically increased for the same reasons as ma deals the patent cliff and risk sharing unlike ma collaboration and licensing transactions often allow the pharmaceutical company to retain the benefit of its partner’s expertise and the ability to innovate fast they also allow pharmaceutical companies to access expertise outside their core business whether in biotechnology medical devices or digital health which is perceived as a key area of growth korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter price structures the price structure of ma and licensing deals tends to converge in life sciences since earnout clauses are quite common in ma transactions in an earnout structure the ultimate price is based on the performance of the target or its assets following the closing in life sciences the earnout triggers are often linked to the development or the commercialization of the acquired products this mechanism is intended to bridge the valuation gap between the value expected by the seller and the price that the buyer is willing to pay at any given stage of the life cycle of the product this alignment is of the utmost importance considering the intrinsic uncertainty of rd coupled with the heavy regulatory and market access constraints which make it difficult for the buyer to pay full price until the acquired assets are derisked it is therefore not surprising that more than  per cent of life sciences ma deals contain earnout provisions this mechanism is used both in private ma and in public ma in the form of contingent value rights since the achievement of earnout triggering events depends on the management of the acquired business by the buyer there is a risk of litigation when the buyer fails to meet the targeted performance in most cases the share purchase agreement states the anticipated level of diligence that is expected from the buyer in pursuing the triggering events in life sciences however there are so many uncertainties out of the parties’ reasonable control that it is difficult to request firm commitments from the buyer the compromise is often to agree on a very qualified definition of “commercially reasonable efforts” or “diligent efforts” this must take into account the level of effort and resources consistent with those used by the buyer or a similar company for a similar product with a similar market potential at a similar stage in its development or product life balanced against a number of factors such as market exclusivity competitiveness of alternate products profitability and sometimes provisions referring to all other relevant factors these earnout systems are very likely to lead to disputes as a result of their complexity and the amounts usually at stake when disputes occur it is often difficult to determine the damages suffered by the seller in licensing agreements one of the remedies for the licensee’s breach of its obligation to diligently develop and commercialize the licensed product could be that the license is terminated and the licensor obtains the product back along with all improvements generated by the licensee so that it is able to exploit the product itself or to find a better partner this reversion is more difficult to implement in an ma context where the sellers may not be willing or have the capacity to take the assets back in conclusion despite a strong convergence between ma and licensing with more and more backendloaded ma transactions licensing and collaboration remain the preferred methods for life sciences companies to expand their product portfolios korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter rewarding longterm shareholders european and us loyalty share programs tom conaghan washington dc lionel lesur paris lindsey reighard dallas louis leroy paris “longterm oriented shareholders who hold on to their shares during the difficult but critical time the company is facing will thus be rewarded” this is how the ceo of the tire manufacturer michelin explained the motivation behind the issuance of loyalty shares commonly referred to as lshares in the form of a warrant by his company in  loyalty shares or shares that provide a reward to shareholders typically in the form of additional shares or dividends if they hold their shares for a certain period of time and other similar loyalty share programs have become increasingly popular in european countries as a way to incentivize longterm shareholding and are slowly making their way into the united states loyalty share programs in europe rewarding longterm shareholding is no novelty in europe where it has been subject to regulation by the european union since the financial crisis of  the european parliament passed directive ec to regulate the exercise of certain rights of shareholders in listed companies and amended the directive on july   however these pieces of legislation provide a limited framework for encouraging a higher level of monitoring and engagement by institutional investors and asset managers and instead leave these issues in the hands of the individual eu member states the french legal system offers several mechanisms to support longterm shareholding the latest being implemented on march   with the adoption of the socalled “loi florange” french listed companies must automatically grant double voting rights to shareholders who hold their shares in registered form for at least  years art l§ of the french commercial code and nonlisted companies may grant double voting rights to their shareholders who hold their shares in registered form for the same period art l§ of the french commercial code listed and nonlisted french companies may also issue l warrants art l et seq of the french commercial code to certain shareholders or grant loyalty dividends an additional dividend under certain conditions art l of the french commercial code these loyalty schemes have been implemented by many major french listed companies such as l’oréal electricité de france and crédit agricole loyalty dividend or vivendi engie and air france klm double voting rights other european countries have adopted similar mechanisms the netherlands permits companies to grant multiple voting rights to certain categories of shareholders provided that such companies register their shares in a “loyalty register” this scheme was notably used by ferrari nv in its ipo and by fiat chrysler automobiles nv upon completion of the crossborder reverse merger by chryslerfiat with and into fiat investments nv in  in italy a legislative decree of january   allowed listed companies to pay increased dividends to shareholders that hold common shares for a certain period at least one year in august  a reform authorized both listed and nonlisted italian companies to issue shares with multiple voting rights these rewarding schemes have been a success and a number of italian companies including in particular campari and amplifon have awarded loyalty shares to certain categories of shareholders loyalty share programs in the united states despite the popularity of programs in europe designed to reward longterm shareholders us companies have been slow to implement these types of programs the us stock market is generally characterized by “shorttermism” a focus on shortterm results at the expense of longterm performance driven in part by the need to report quarterly earnings us shareholders many of which are institutional investors tend to hold their shares for a short period of time according to the  nyse group turnover statistics the annualized turnover for shares listed and traded on the nyse at the end of  was  indicating that a majority of shareholders held their shares for less than one year a common example of shorttermism in the united states is short selling generally a short sale is the sale of a security by a seller that does not own the security the seller typically borrows the security that it has sold for delivery to the buyer with the expectation that the seller can buy back the same security at a later date for a lower price and turn a profit a “naked” short sale occurs when the seller does not borrow the security in time to deliver it to the buyer within the standard threeday settlement korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter period naked short selling which can send misleading signals to the market and decrease share prices came under intensified scrutiny in the wake of the  financial crisis following speculation that it had contributed to the collapse of certain us financial firms facing the rising backlash among companies against short sellers the us securities and exchange commission “sec” has taken a variety of regulatory enforcement and emergency actions to address concerns regarding failures of delivery and abusive naked short selling including amendments to regulation sho and regulation m the sec attempted to promote longterm shareholding by proposing a rule that would have provided shareholders who held a significant amount of company stock for at least  years the right to include in the company’s proxy statement their own director nominees the rule was ultimately invalidated by the us courts but that did not stop many companies from voluntarily or in response to demands from shareholder activists their own proxy access bylaws proxy access provisions can now be found in the bylaws of a majority of the fortune  and generally they also require at least  years ownership in order to be eligible to nominate director candidates for inclusion in the company’s proxy statement however unlike its european counterparts the sec has yet to adopt mechanisms expressly permitting loyalty shares voting rights and dividends given the lack of regulatory framework to guide companies when implementing loyalty share programs it is not surprising that these types of programs remain a novelty in the united states nonetheless some us companies have ventured into these relatively uncharted waters for example the jm smucker company has adopted “time phased voting” allowing each share that has been held for more than four years to have  votes per share instead of one vote on certain matters and nexpoint credit strategies fund has offered or offers a  match through nexpoint advisors lp its investment advisor to shareholders that buy and hold the fund’s common shares for at least one year other companies have offered warrants to purchase shares that are exercisable at a certain period of time in the future like checkcap ltd an israeli company that issued warrants to its us ipo purchasers in  that permitted such purchasers to acquire common shares at a fixed purchase price if they held their ipo shares for a minimum of  years registration of loyalty shares if a company decides to pursue a loyalty share program for us shareholders it should consider whether the loyalty share program constitutes a “sale” or an “offer to sell” a security that requires registration under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” section a of the securities act defines a “sale” as a “…disposition of a security or interest in a security for value” emphasis added as a result a “typical” dividend does not require registration because it is not given “for value” additionally in the context of a corporate “spin off” transaction the sec staff has stated that a parent spinning off the shares of its subsidiary to its shareholders does not have to register those spun off subsidiary shares under the securities act as a sale as long as certain conditions are met including the condition that the spin off must be pro rata to the parent’s shareholders sec staff legal bulletin   this condition is important because as the sec staff stated “if a spinoff is not pro rata the shareholders’ relative interests change and some shareholders give up value for the spun off shares” depending on the relevant facts and circumstances the distribution of loyalty shares might therefore be characterized as a “sale” of securities that requires registration the sec might view a loyalty share as being more similar to a “right” issued in a rights offering in that the holder can elect to exercise that right by foregoing the legal right to transfer its underlying shares thereby accepting investment risk in exchange for receiving the loyalty share even though there is no exercise price for a loyalty share as you would see in a typical rights offering or with a warrant there could be “value” flowing back to the company in the form of loyalty lack of volatility and other indirect benefits that longterm shareholders provide to the company the sec might also take a “remedybased” approach by stating that the holder who chose to “register” his “intent” to be loyal is really making an investment decision and if he is damaged for holding the underlying shares ie the share price drops while he is trying to make it to the loyalty date he should be entitled to receive as damages the “consideration” he “paid” for registering into the loyalty share program korea newsletter   volume   korea newsletter contact for more information about our korea

loyalty share programs in the united states and the lack of precedent or specific support for loyalty shares without registration companies would be prudent to either register such shares or at a minimum seek no action relief from the sec fiduciary duties when approving a loyalty share program directors of a company should be careful to ensure that they comply with their fiduciary duties to the company and its shareholders directors of delaware corporations are generally protected by the business judgement rule and the presumption that the board acted in the best interest of the corporation however one of the situations in which this presumption may be rebutted thereby shifting the burden to the directors to show the entire fairness of the transaction is when selfdealing is present a classic example of selfdealing is non prorata distributions where a majority shareholder receives a dividend that is not paid to minority shareholders depending on the structure of the loyalty share program and the ownership of the corporation issuing loyalty shares or additional votes to shareholders who have held their shares for a longer period of time which in many cases may be majority shareholders could subject directors to breach of fiduciary duty claims steps forward the article highlights only a few of the issues that a company should consider before implementing a loyalty share program for us shareholders because of the lack of regulatory guidance in the united states unlike in europe companies should tread carefully if they decide to proceed with such a
