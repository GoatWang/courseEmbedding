patricia f russo — biography patricia f russo – chairwoman president and chief executive officer lucent technologies nationality american born  in trenton new jersey education georgetown university bs harvard business school advanced management program  family daughter of a physician and homemaker married stepchildren two career ibm corporation – sales and marketing management att – management and executive positions in strategic planning marketing human resources and operations – president of atts business communications systems unit lucent technologies – executive vice president of corporate operations – executive vice president and ceo of service provider networks group eastman kodak  president and coo lucent technologies – chairwoman and ceo awards  most powerful women in american business fortune     address lucent technologies  mountain avenue murray hill new jersey  httpwwwlucentcom ■ patricia russo rose through the ranks of the telecommunications giant att and helped launch its spinoff company lucent technologies lucent developed into a leading supplier of communications hardware software and services riding the telecommunications boom of the late s when the telecom bubble burst russo left lucent to take the number two spot at eastman kodak her reign there was short in less than a year she returned to tend to the beleaguered lucent after taking over as president and ceo she resolutely cut costs and trimmed staff in order to improve the companys financial outlook and restore consumer confidence reporters and colleagues alternately described russo as conservative and dynamic in the calgary herald she said of herself im deliberate and i believe in letting people who patricia f russo apwide world photos  have a stake in things weigh in but i wouldnt call that cautious ill make the decisions we need to make june   the early years russo grew up in a large middleclass family in a new jersey suburb a natural athlete she was cocaptain of her high school basketball team and captain of the cheerleading squad after graduating from georgetown university with a degree in political science and history she joined the sales and marketing department at international business machines ibm she was there for eight years and eventually rose to the position of marketing manager even when she was just starting out in the business world russo dared to tread on territory where few women had ventured when she joined ibm she was one of the only women selling mainframes early in my career there were some people who didnt believe a woman belonged in sales she told businessweek  but i worked hard on the accounts i was given and made sure i met the customers needs and focused on producing results for the company what i found is that results matter—its hard to argue with them people who produce results rise to the top may   moving up through the ranks of att and lucent russo was hired by att in  and quickly began moving up within the ranks of the sales and marketing departments in  she was called upon to overhaul the companys struggling global business communications systems she focused the divisions efforts on voice systems improved its core products cut costs and spurred overseas expansion through these efforts she was able to stem huge financial losses and boost revenues by  percent to  billion transforming the unit from a money bleeder into a clear profit maker russo was still with att when the telecommunications giant decided to spinoff its equipment division in  lucent technologies was born in  she became executive vice president and chairwoman of lucents  billion service provider networks group a position that placed russo in charge of  employees although russos career was going strong her company would soon face rough roads in  lucent began a sharp downturn telecommunications spending had dropped and the companys sales and stock prices suffered as a result most of the blame for the companys troubles was placed on the ceo richard mcginn to stop the bleeding he began to spin off lucent divisions in the end virtually all that was left was russos service provider networks which mcginn brought under the corporate umbrella essentially squeezing russo out experts say her reduced role the constant infighting between mcginn and his staff and mcginns questionable accounting practices he allegedly reported revenue on sales that were not final ultimately drove russo out the door in august  a career shift russo enjoyed a brief period of time off painting and catching up on sleep in april  she found herself back on the corporate fast track when eastman kodak wooed her to its rochester new york headquarters with the offer of its number two slot she became president and chief operating officer the highest position ever attained by a woman at that company management hired her because of her track record and because it was hoped her technological expertise would help kodak modernize from film to digital imaging the chairman daniel carp said in businessweek that she brought skills to exactly where the company needed them—right in the sweet spot april   she was charged with helping the film and photo company integrate its imaging products with the latest technologies overseeing the daytoday functions of the operating divisions and seeking out new business opportunities while russo tended to kodak her former employer was ailing excess network capacity left over from the internet boom combined with lagging consumer demand were taking their toll on the telecom industry as a whole lucents customers—telephone and wireless companies—were themselves suffering from slow sales and as a result cut back on their equipment purchases in  lucent reported a  billion net loss the value of its stock had fallen nearly  percent within a single year lucent management was in a state of upheaval mcginn had been let go in october  with henry schacht serving as interim ceo and trying to find a replacement he eventually turned his attention to russo a quick return less than one year after she had left russo returned to lucent taking over as ceo on january   she asked schacht to stay on as her senior advisor she was reportedly lured back with an attractive compensation package a  million salary plus a  million bonus package and  million stock options when she returned she told the associated press its like coming home january   at the time russo was one of only six female ceos running fortune  companies and just like carly fiorina of hewlettpackard and anne mulcahy of xerox russo was put in charge of a company in crisis the company had spun off its agere systems unit which produced integrated circuits and opticalelectronics systems and avaya formerly business communications which she had run supplier of officetelephone and voicemessaging systems in  capital spending by phone companies in the united states fell  percent as a result lucent was struggling in a sea of debt thus being named lucent ceo wasnt like inheriting a world championship team steve kamman an executive director at cibc world markets told businessweek may   the response to russos return was mixed some industry insiders predicted that she would boost sagging company morale company leaders felt that her insider status and familiarity with lucents products would facilitate her helping the company return to profitability in a statement in network world  schacht said pat brings deep knowledge of our industry and our customers coupled with the ability to lead a large organization through change she understands and embraces our strategic and restructuring plans and she can step in as ceo without missing a beat january   but some analysts were concerned that her return simply signaled a reemergence of lucents old bureaucratic ways an unfavorable reminder of the att days im concerned that the management team at lucent is heavily concentrated with people who have been there for  to  years the lehman brothers analyst steve levy told telephony january   even as pressure mounted russo maintained her composure stephanie mehta of fortune commented on her flawless posture and the way she chooses her words she comes across as well prepared and in command april   although she was known and respected for her firm leadership she also had a softer side that she was quick to exhibit in the company of friends and employees she reportedly carried chocolate a favorite food wherever she went in order to prove that she was a real person russo was determined to turn lucent around and show a profit by september  she later had to revise her estimate to  her first order of business was to execute the turnaround plan that schacht had drafted which focused on the sales of lucent products to wirelesstelecommunication companies such as att and verizon wireless and internet service providers lucent faced a lot of competition in that arena however from companies such as cisco systems and ciena corporation russo set to work reducing operating expenses vendorfinancing commitments and working capital the reduction of expenses necessitated spinning or selling off businesses that no longer fit within the companys sharpened focus another more difficult part of reducing expenses was the cutting of staff by the time russo took charge the company had already trimmed the number of employees by nearly half removing about  jobs russo would oversee thousands more layoffs in an effort to return to profitability lucent began to reshift its focus from simply providing equipment to the telecommunications industry to providing customercentric services rather than just promote the companys existing products lucent asked customers what they wanted and designed offerings accordingly the new lucent offered a wide range of services from installation to network optimization and outsourcing the company began looking at establishing new partnerships—some even with rivals in may  lucent signed a deal to resell products produced by its competitor juniper networks russo also focused on the companys strongest moneymaking potential its sales force in many ways i am lucents chief salesperson now more than ever an experienced creative and committed sales team is absolutely critical to our turnaround and success going forward she told sales and marketing management november   it was not surprising that russo so aggressively pursued sales as she was well known for her competitiveness colleagues had reportedly asked her not to participate in golf and tennis matches on corporate retreats because she tended to win every game in  golf digest ranked her among the top  ceo golfers in the country despite russos efforts in october  lucents market position had not improved the company posted its th straight quarterly loss to the tune of  billion its stock which had soared to more than  a share in  had subsequently plunged more than  percent to less than a dollar standard  poors dropped lucents credit rating which was already considered junk some investors talked about the possibility of bankruptcy a suggestion russo and other company executives quickly dismissed she told the boston globe  when this storm is over we expect to be a leader october   weathering the storm in february  russo was named chairwoman of lucent after a tough couple of years things were starting to look up for the beleaguered company eight months later in october lucent reported a profit for the first time in three years although she admitted the company would probably still have its financial ups and downs russo announced that lucent was finished downsizing having reduced the number of employees from the  of three years before to about  and would not lay off any additional staff we have weathered the storm she told the associated press october   russo sat on the boards of scheringplough corporation xerox corporation new jersey manufacturers

the most widely held stocks in the late s lucent had seen its share price plummet to less than  per share by  as business dried up and layoffs and financial losses persisted the chances of lucents

before the end of  but she kept her word met that goal and led lucent through four profitable quarters in fiscal year        patricia fiorello russo was born june   in trenton nj among her six
