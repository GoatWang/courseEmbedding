and more effective solutions for insulindependent diabetes bigfoot biomedical is dedicated to designing simpler safer and more effective solutions for people with insulinrequiring diabetes our story beginsare we ever going to sleep againin  the fiveyearold son of a wall street quant trader was diagnosed with type  diabetes td with no cure in sight the diagnosis meant a lifetime of multiple daily insulin injections or clunky medical devices analyzing every meal countless blood tests a constant fear of seizures and an end to sleeping through the night but this father was unlike many this dad hacked into an offtheshelf insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor wrote an algorithm to automatically dose insulin in the right amount at the right time and married these pieces together in a companion mobile app  effectively creating an automated insulin delivery system since  his wife also a person with td and his son have been living as though diabetes barely exists they eat play and work without the distress of dealing with diabetes this mystery man dubbed “bigfoot” by the media and his code finetuned by more than  hours of realworld use formed the foundation of bigfoot biomedical read more our vision for diabetes management at bigfoot we envision a world where life with diabetes is easier we want to add sleep reduce fear and worry and increase the time that all people with insulinrequiring diabetes spend living a healthy life to do that we have to ask ourselves how do you reduce the diabetes burden read more more than just a device we are drawing a circle around everything that it takes to manage insulinrequiring diabetes we think about the complexity of diabetes therapies and how we can design simpler solutions that more people can actually access we consider the way a healthcare provider prescribes a therapy and how we can eliminate hundreds of unnecessary steps we think about how a therapy might deliver value to an insurance payer so that we can create a sustainable business from one end of the spectrum to the other we are thinking of ways to reduce the pain points of managing diabetes we are designing comprehensive solutions of device

updates on bigfoot sightings contact vision – bigfoot biomedical vision how do you reduce the diabetes burdenyou start with envisioning what life might look like without itat bigfoot one of our core design principles is to reduce the burden of living with type  and insulinrequiring type  diabetes closing an insulin delivery loop is part of the equation but we believe that there is more to simplifying diabetes that involves thoughtful approaches like easy setup leveraging the power of smart technologies that we already use in other aspects of our lives and a comprehensive yet simple supply management system these are the questions we ask about diabetes management what would it take for you to sleep through the night without worrying so much about your blood sugar dropping too low what if you had a system that knew to give you a bit more insulin when your blood sugars were running high  without an extra shot or without you having to press a bunch of buttons how could we harness the power of machine learning for insulin dosing what if diabetes supplies showed up at your door before you opened the last bottle of test strips what if you didnt have three or four diabetes devices to update every time there was a time change what if your healthcare provider prescribed something because he or she felt supported and confident about the complete service assistance and training the company would provide what if your diabetes therapy was so effective that your insurance company said yes this is so much better and you paid just one copayment for everything what if all the things you hate about diabetes management were outsourced to a system that never gets tired never checks out never forgets and knows how to keep you safe our vision for automated insulin delivery leverage existing smartphone technology simple tight integration between components secure communication  connected ecosystem automate decisions about insulin delivery in real time leverage cloudconnectivity technologies accessed with single prescription and reimbursed as a service for a monthly fee our vision for a connected ecosystemat bigfoot we are designing a smart connected

what is “automated insulin delivery are bigfoots solutions the same as the system that bryan mazlish created for his family has bigfoot considered concerns about smartphone security and performance do bigfoots solutions include glucagon can i order bigfoots products when will they be available i live outside the us will bigfoots solutions be available in my country will my health insurance cover bigfoots solutions can i participate in your clinical trials do you offer tours of bigfoot’s lair where can i buy those cool bigfoot tshirts what is type  diabetes type  diabetes td once known as juvenile diabetes is an autoimmune disease meaning that the body’s own immune system for reasons unknown attacks cells in the body that it shouldn’t in the case of td the immune system destroys cells in the pancreas that produce a hormone called insulin that is necessary to convert the food you eat into energy people with td must take insulin for the rest of their lives either through a pump or daily injections in order to prevent their blood glucose levels from rising too high though often diagnosed in childhood td can be diagnosed at any age it is an intensely managed condition requiring hundreds of decisions a day about how much insulin to take how to respond to blood glucose levels how to make choices about the food you eat and the activities in which you participate just to name a few the roots of bigfoot’s founders stem from their personal experience with td and it is their personal and professional mission as well as many of the people working at bigfoot to bring to market our automated insulin delivery solutions to make living with td easier and safer what is type  diabetes type  diabetes td is a metabolic condition in which the body is either unable to use the insulin made by the pancreas known as insulin resistance or in which the pancreas loses the ability to continue to produce insulin at the level that the body needs a progressive disease td often requires adjustments to therapy over time which often includes the addition of insulin according to recent statistics from the cdc more than  of people with td in  included insulin in their daily treatment regimen td may be diagnosed at any age and it is the most common type of diabetes affecting roughly  of people with diabetes bigfoots automated insulin delivery solutions are intended to help those with td who require insulin to optimize their insulin dosing regimen in the simplest smartest way possible what is hypoglycemia hypoglycemia or low blood sugar occurs when there is not enough glucose in the bloodstream to fuel the cells of the body hypoglycemia is considered any glucose level below  mgdl  mmoll it can be caused by too much insulin or other diabetes medication or by activity such as exercise symptoms may include shakiness sweatiness headache blurry vision hunger palpitations and confusion severe hypoglycemia may result in loss of consciousness seizures brain damage and in rare cases death severe hypoglycemia such as a seizure that requires a hospital admission results in a huge cost to the person with diabetes as well as the healthcare system bigfoot’s automated insulin delivery solutions intend to significantly reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia as well as the costs associated with it what is hyperglycemia hyperglycemia or high blood sugar occurs when there is too much glucose in the bloodstream a number of factors can cause hyperglycemia in people with diabetes including but not limited to lack of insulin food that has been eaten stress illness and hormones symptoms may include thirst frequent urination hunger or fatigue severe hyperglycemia can result in a condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis dka which may lead to coma kidney failure a problem with heart rhythm heart attack muscle breakdown rhabdomyolysis and in rare cases death similar to severe hypoglycemia severe hyperglycemia or dka has significant costs to the person with diabetes and the healthcare system by leveraging data and automation bigfoot automated insulin delivery solutions intend to significantly reduce the instances of severe hypoglycemia and its related costs what is “time in range “time in range” refers to the percentage of time that a person’s blood glucose levels are in the recommended target range appropriate for that person different than hbac which is a measurement that reflects an average glucose level over a period of time time in range reflects the total amount of time that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are avoided a primary goal of bigfoot is to provide solutions for people with td or insulinrequiring td to spend more of their time in their target glucose ranges increasing their “time in range” what is “automated insulin delivery “automated insulin delivery” is the term we use at bigfoot to describe how a system uses information about glucose to change the delivery of insulin to assist in reducing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia increasing time spent in a healthy safe target glucose range referred to in the media as an “artificial pancreas” an automated insulin delivery system is not an implanted device and not a biological cure for diabetes are bigfoots solutions the same as the system that bryan mazlish created for his family the investigational system in development at bigfoot biomedical is not the system that bryan mazlish created for his family the mazlish system was a proofofconcept system that has inspired the work we do today especially the real world experiences that bryan’s wife and son have had while living with and wearing their system for over  hours has bigfoot considered concerns about smartphone security and performance security is a top priority of bigfoot our team members have significant experience across consumer technology enterprise software and the regulated medical device space so unlike a traditional medtech company we are approaching questions of security  as well as concerns about the many ways in which we live and interact with consumer tech devices like smartphones  thoughtfully working in tandem with fda to ensure that concerns are addressed through our approach do bigfoots solutions include glucagon we look forward to the day that the us food  drug administration fda approves glucagon for use in an infusion pump and this option becomes available currently there is no fdaapproved glucagon available for administration via an infusion pump and there are many unanswered questions around the chronic administration of glucagon as well as the use of glucagon in a closed loop system in the meantime we are maintaining a singular focus on developing a safe simple reliable and accessible insulinonly system that is available asap can i order bigfoots products when will they be available bigfoot investigational system is still in development at this time its our goal to submit our investigational system for premarket approval pma to the us fda in
