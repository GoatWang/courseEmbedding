area and now expanding rapidly into areas of nyc over  construction starts successfully executed since  please see track record with over  projects currently progressing in brooklyn and philadelphia nria’s investment process includes i targeting core urban areas in the midst of gentrification where we believe assets are located directly in the path of longterm rent unit sales and property value growth ii acquiring what we feel is significantly underutilized real estate where we can create value in the community and for our investors iii maintaining a highlycontrolled audited development process and leveraging extensive underwriting credit and capital markets expertise to prudently execute on a growing opportunity set ultimately offering investors a scalable and repeatable investment

fourunit multifamily property the “property” into a boutique threeunit highend condominium development located in the prime carroll gardens neighborhood of brooklyn ny the property is currently under contract and will be nria’s seventh brooklyn development of similar size scope since midq  the property is more specifically located on summit street between hicks henry just miles south of manhattan miles from the brooklyn bridge and within a short walking distance to numerous subway lines making for an easy commute anywhere in nyc the unobstructed view of the manhattan skyline background picture

private equity capital markets asset management and operational expertise the firm has successfully executed hundreds of construction starts within core urban markets since  and consistently partners with many of the same regional team members to provide a highlyaudited efficient development process within the philadelphia and nyc markets nria’s superior track record supports a growing investor base which ultimately creates a liquidity profile that is quite unique in real estate development notable milestones  starts since  alone ≈m in completed unit value since  unique risk  reward investment profile defined as a short duration tomonth highyield investment  offering a  net return paid monthly nria believes the current pay structure compensates investors immediately and

conservatively estimated total gross and net sales proceeds of  million and  million respectively implying an as completed psf price of  weighted average range psf  psf compared to the breakeven psf price of  assuming a maximum project term of months which would also leave investors with their preferred return and principal note as a normal course of due diligence nria had a third party “as

eligible for profits only after sellout the sponsor has made other significant credit enhancements available to the investors through i the borrowing entity summit street capital  llc and flowing through to the managing member entity nria brooklyn ii llc executing recourse to standard lender carveouts andor completion guarantees in addition to the completion guarantee provided by the general contractor this structure is intended to mitigate and distribute any perceived risk associated with growing contingent liabilities due to the current ongoing negotiations with the construction lenders there also may be an element of crosscollateralization with the underlying property and similar nria sponsored loans the final structure will be detailed in the operating agreement however nria anticipated these structural nuances and enhanced the investors position further through … ii the nria buyback agreement putoption whereby nria will acquire and pay investors for any unsold finished units at the end of the investment term in an amount guaranteed to return all investor capital in the unlikely event the targeted sellout price points were not met the investment stability low correlation of the nyc housing market vs other markets broader sp andor reit volatility etc see further information clearly make this an ideal longerterm rental investment for one of nria’s many highnetworth partners utilizing their pledged asset loan option further information available iii the nria fixed contractor cost agreement project management guarantees which covers all cost overruns during the duration of the project and eliminates the need for additional investor capital calls ultimately these structural features further illustrate nria’s ability to execute and speak to how high we rank capital preservation strengths table of contentsslide   the property is located in a prime urban growing area of brooklyn nyc’s largest and fastest growing borough population growth   –  brooklyn has over  million residents and if it was defined as its own city it would be the  th largest in the us the property is more specifically located within the carroll gardens neighborhood of brooklyn and is just miles from manhattan and centrally located within walking distance to public transportation subway nine separate lines brooklyn has emerged as an incubator for technology advertising media design and innovation which is shown through the i ≈ increase in patent filings in brooklyn over the last years alone and ii the number of adults with advanced degrees moving to brooklyn tripling from  to    population job growth shortage of new “affordable” supply continued household formation lack of developable air rights in the neighborhood and interest rates remaining low for the foreseeable future are all important underlying fundamentals that should continue to drive robust growth for many years to come cost efficiency nria’s proprietary construction bidding process volume of purchasing and history with a coreteam of development partners contractors architects engineers building suppliers etc have effectively created certain economies of scale as it relates to overall project costs therefore nria will have a fixed contract cost agreement in place with our gc which will cover all cost overruns during the duration of the project and eliminates potential delays due solely to cost disputes etc construction costs for  summit street are estimated at psf with an appraised quality standard of “q” exceptional highend custom build which is far less
