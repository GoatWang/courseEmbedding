are affirmed appellants castleton commodities international llc vitol inc vitol capital  management ltd plains all american pipeline lp morgan stanley capital group inc and shell oil company appeal from two orders entered on october   by the us district court for the southern district of new york pauley j the orders were entered in two parallel suits against defendantsappellees parnon energy inc arcadia petroleum ltd arcadia energy suisse sa nicholas j wildgoose and james t dyer one an enforcement action filed by plaintiffappellee the us commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” and the other a class action filed by plaintiffappellee stephen e ardizzone and others the “class plaintiffs” both suits allege that the defendants engaged in an unlawful scheme to manipulate the price of light sweet crude oil futures in late 0 and early 0 in the orders under review the district court allowed the defendants to produce to the class plaintiffs large numbers of confidential business documents that the appellants had previously produced to the cftc as part of a nationwide investigation into possible manipulation of crude oil prices and that the cftc in turn had produced to the defendants in the enforcement action the court conditioned its discovery orders on the parties’ entry of modified protective orders making more stringent the safeguards governing the parties’ review of the documents the appellants challenge these discovery orders on grounds of relevance and confidentiality we assume the parties’ familiarity with the underlying facts procedural history and issues presented for review before turning to the merits we must first address our jurisdiction to review these pretrial discovery orders which were not final when the notices of appeal were filed see  usc §  fed r civ p b generally “a party that seeks to present an objection to a discovery order immediately to a court of appeals must refuse compliance be held in contempt and then appeal the contempt order” church of scientology of california v united states 0  us   n  “under the socalled perlman doctrine” however “a discovery order directed at a disinterested third party is treated as an immediately appealable final order because the third party presumably lacks a sufficient stake in the proceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance” id citing perlman v united states  us   here the district court’s orders are directed not to the appellants but to the defendants who although parties to the litigation have no interest in risking contempt on the appellants’ behalf and in fact have already turned over the documents in question to the class plaintiffs the district court’s orders are therefore final and appealable under the perlman doctrine with regard to the appeal from the order in the cftc action we note that we also have appellate jurisdiction under ordinary finality principles on august   the district court entered a final consent order in the cftc action and although the clerk has not entered final judgment the order leaves no doubt that all claims and defenses have been fully and finally resolved and that all prior decisions in the case are now final see bankers trust co v mallis  us    per curiam in addition while the notices of appeal were filed before the discovery order was rendered final “‘in the absence of prejudice to the nonappealing party this court    has declined to dismiss premature notices of appeal where subsequent actions of the district court have imbued the order appealed from with finality’” smith ex rel smith v half hollow hills cent sch dist  fd   d cir  per curiam ellipsis in original quoting leonhard v united states  fd   d cir 0 we must also address the suggestions by the class plaintiffs and the cftc that these appeals are moot a dispute is moot when by virtue of an intervening event a court of appeals cannot grant any effectual relief whatever in favor of the appellant” calderon v moore   us    internal quotation marks omitted here the class plaintiffs point out that both they and the defendants already possess the documents in question and have begun reviewing them but these changed circumstances do not prevent us from ordering meaningful relief as the appellants point out we may order the return of any irrelevant or unreviewed documents or limit their use in court for example for its part the cftc argues that because the cftc action has now settled any order that might be entered in that action would be of no effect but under the terms of the amended protective order entered in the cftc action following the settlement the defendants remain in possession of the appellants’ documents were we to conclude that the defendants hold those documents in violation of the appellants’ rights to protect their confidential information we could grant the appellants at least partial relief by ordering the defendants to return or destroy the documents see church of scientology 0 us at  “even though it is now too late to prevent or to provide a fully satisfactory remedy for the invasion of privacy that occurred when the irs obtained the information on the tapes a court does have the power to effectuate a partial remedy by ordering the government to destroy or return any and all copies it may have in its possession” we accordingly conclude that neither appeal is moot turning to the merits district courts “enjoy wide discretion in their handling of pre trial discovery” and “we will reverse a district court’s discovery ruling only upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion” wills v amerada hess corp  fd   d cir 0 “a district court ‘abuses’ or ‘exceeds’ the discretion accorded to it when  its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding or  its decision—though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a  clearly erroneous factual finding—cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions” zervos v verizon new york inc  fd   d cir 0 footnotes omitted the appellants first argue that the documents in question have not been shown to be relevant under federal rule of civil procedure  “parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense” fed r civ p b in addition “for good cause the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action” id “relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence” id relevance to the subject matter under rule  is “construed broadly to encompass any matter that bears on or that reasonably could lead to other matter that could bear on any issue that is or may be in the case” oppenheimer fund inc v sanders  us 0   in this case the defendants served requests on the cftc seeking documents referring or relating to the defendants and the cftc based on its limited resources conducted a relevance review using sampling techniques and date ranges to identify responsive records the district court then found that the documents the cftc produced were relevant to the class action even where they included the defendants’ internal communications and financial reports records from outside the period of the defendants’ alleged scheme and documents regarding other grades of oil the court reasoned that such documents could shed light on the perceptions and reactions of other market participants to the alleged manipulation provide a benchmark for the behavior of a nonmanipulated market and inform an analysis of the scope of the pertinent market we see no abuse of discretion in these determinations in addition while the appellants  fault the cftc the class plaintiffs and the district court for failing to conduct a more particularized relevance analysis the appellants cite no authority requiring particularized relevance determinations and the text of rule  is to the contrary see fed r civ p b requiring only that discovery be “reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence” emphasis added in the alternative the appellants argue that any relevance the documents may have had is outweighed by the appellants’ strong interest in maintaining the privacy of their confidential business records under rule c a district court “may for good cause issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance embarrassment oppression or undue burden or expense” including by “requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research development or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way” fed r civ p c cg this rule “confers broad discretion on the trial court to decide when a protective order is appropriate and what degree of protection is required” seattle times co v rhinehart  us    the district court here carefully considered the appellants’ interest in confidentiality and in fact strengthened the already stringent requirements of the protective orders in both cases in response to the appellants’ concerns we find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s determination that the strengthened protective orders—which closely limit the individuals who can view highly confidential documents—adequately protect the appellants’ confidentiality the appellants also raise broader policy concerns regarding the district court’s orders contending that they will chill third parties like the appellants from cooperating with government investigations but the cftc here provided notice when it first sought the  appellants’ documents that whatever the appellants turned over would be subject to “routine uses” including use in litigation and disclosure in response to a subpoena br for cftc add at – moreover the appellants’ policy concerns were considered and rejected not only by the district court but also by the cftc both of whom are better situated than we are to weigh concerns about cooperation with future government investigations against other relevant considerations again we see no abuse of discretion we have considered all of the appellants’ remaining arguments and find them to be without merit accordingly for the foregoing reasons the orders of the district court are affirmed for the court catherine o’hagan wolfe clerk  nevertheless we note that agencies like the cftc would be well advised to provide advance notice to third parties like the appellants whose documents the agency intends to disclose in response to a discovery request advance notice will enable parties and district courts to address any issues attendant to production on the front end before thirdparty documents are disclosed outside the agency indeed although the appellants do not raise the issue advance notice is statutorily required where the agency discloses information in response to a subpoena or summons see  usc § f providing that the cftc “shall disclose information in its possession pursuant to a subpoena or summons only if” at least fourteen days before disclosure the agency mails a copy of the subpoena or summons “to the last known home or business address of the person who submitted the information” or “provides other appropriate notice of the subpoena or summons to such person”
