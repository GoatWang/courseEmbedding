shiebler  oneyear performance is a very dangerous thing to play with qa william b shiebler  oneyear performance is a very dangerous thing to play with mar     am by frederick p gabriel putnam investments attributes much of its success to teamwork often assigning four or five managers to a single mutual fund that way its fortunes do not ride on any one manager but the strategic direction of the company has rested firmly in the hands of one man william n shiebler president of putnams retail mutual fund business for the past eight years and his shoes are not going to be easy to fill when he retires in about two years mr shieblers successor will manage a business that accounts for about  billion of the no  fund companys  billion in assetsknown in the mutual fund industry as a visionary mr shiebler was one of the first to view banks as a distribution channel today putnam says  of the banks that market mutual funds offer its wares more recently hes won kudos for insisting that fund managers maintain style consistency  way before the issue moved to center stagewhile the company searches for a successor mr shiebler who spent  years with dean witter reynolds is doing what he does best selling mutual funds putnam will debut several new ones including a fund slated for june to be managed by  research analysts qwhere do you see the greatest opportunities to expand your product linea its still in domestic equities i mean you dont leave the party until its over and certainly the market has been so strong that domestic equity is the primary part of our product line but we see great opportunity in international funds we doubled our market share last year we think theres opportunity in the highyield sector and we think investors are going to increasingly use taxdeferred annuities because of the attractive features and benefits they haveq in  the average return on putnams us stock funds trailed many of the  largest fund families are you doing anything to turn that around this yeara it would be much nicer to be no  on the oneyear list but to tell you the truth its the three five and year numbers we focus on oneyear performance is a very dangerous thing to play with in the mutual fund businessq are you worried about more banks introducing their own fundsawe are a major player in bank distribution and we will continue to be mainly because we took it more seriously than some of our competitors did look our biggest distributors in the brokerdealer business  merrill lynch smith barney prudential dean witter and painewebber  all have their own proprietary mutual fund businesses that they started in the early s and that has not stopped us from being very successfulq what if anything are you doing to help brokers and planners distribute your fundsa were the biggest seller of funds through advisers they are the backbone of our business first and foremost we are an investment management company not a marketing company we plan to introduce more tools for advisers especially in the way of electronic distribution we plan to do more in the way of having a direct link with advisers on the internetq when is it ok for a manager to drift from a consistent styleawe dont think its ok at all unless its announced to investors we think if you buy a can of soup and it says tomato soup you dont want to open it up and find out its pork and beansq with the dow over  what are you doing to prep for a correctiona even with the market at these new highs there are a lot of values out there the market is different than it was last spring interest rates are lower corporate earnings are still continuing to work rather well and the inflation news is still very positive were not bearish on the marketsq are you uneasy about the amount of money pouring into mutual fundsa money has been pouring into mutual funds for a long time and i think its going to continue to pour in for a long time the boomers have suddenly realized that the retirement bell is going to ring sometime in the next  years or more in the us right now the most attractive savings vehicle is still the mutual fund you dont have high yields coming from bank depositsq lets talk about your own retirement have you found a successora were in the process of recruiting one right now im going to work with that person for a while at some point in time ill assume a lower profile within putnam mutual fundsq will that person come from within the companya weve got a lot of strong talent within the company but putnam has a history of being able to recruit outstanding people from outside the company and even outside the industry were going to continue to do that kind of thingvitaewilliam n shiebler  senior managing director president putnam mutual funds
