which when executed by the processor cause the processor to generate an alarm if a problem exists description field of the invention  the present invention relates to network monitoring systems more specifically the invention provides a system that detects problems or potential problems in a network environment background  networks are used to interconnect multiple devices such as computing devices and allow the communication of information between the various interconnected devices many organizations rely on networks to communicate information between different individuals departments work groups and geographic locations in many organizations a network is an important resource that must operate efficiently for example networks are used to communicate electronic mail email share information between individuals and provide access to shared resources such as printers servers and databases a network failure or inefficient operation may significantly affect the ability of certain individuals or groups to perform their required functions  a typical network contains multiple interconnected devices including computers servers printers and various other network communication devices such as routers bridges switches and hubs the multiple devices in a network are interconnected with multiple communication links that allow the various network devices to communicate with one another if a particular network device or network communication link fails multiple devices or the entire network may be affected  network management is the process of managing the various network devices and network communication links to provide the necessary network services to the users of the network typical network management systems collect information regarding the operation and performance of the network and analyze the collected information to detect problems in the network for example a high network utilization or a high network response time may indicate that the network or a particular device or link in the network is approaching an overloaded condition in an overloaded condition network devices may be unable to communicate at a reasonable speed thereby reducing the usefulness of the network in this situation it is important to identify the network problem and the source of the problem such that the proper network operation can be restored  typically existing network management systems compare the current network performance parameters to one or more threshold values associated with the parameters for example an upper threshold of  percent may be associated with a network utilization parameter such that an alarm is generated if the network utilization exceeds  percent a network utilization in excess of  percent may indicate an approaching overload condition similar thresholds may be provided for other network parameters such as response time or number of errors generally only an upper threshold is provided eg network utilization above a particular threshold  typically thresholds used by existing systems are absolute such that an alarm is generated each time a threshold is crossed for example if a network utilization parameter has an associated upper threshold of  percent an alarm is generated if the network utilization is  percent for a specified period of time however an alarm is not generated if the network utilization is  percent for a long period of time also if network utilization drops to five percent because a periodic backup process was not activated an alarm is not generated since the threshold associated with network utilization was not exceeded  these existing systems that use thresholds to identify network problems determine the threshold values eg upper limits based on how the network administrator believes the network should operate since these thresholds are typically static they do not change automatically with changes in the network operation or network configuration instead the network administrator must recalculate or reestimate threshold values manually when a network change occurs typically a single set of threshold values are used for all time periods thus the same thresholds may be used during periods of heavy network utilization eg  pm on a business day and during periods of minimal network utilization eg  pm on a holiday thus the same threshold values are applied at all times regardless of the expected or historical network utilization  for example if a significant increase in network utilization occurs every monday at  am ie the upper threshold is crossed an alarm may be generated every monday even though this is a common event that does not necessarily indicate a network problem similarly if a significant increase in network utilization occurs without crossing the upper threshold at a time when the network utilization is typically minimal an alarm is not generated even though a network problem may exist thus existing systems do not consider typical or historical network operation when determining whether a network problem exists  it is therefore desirable to provide a networkrelated monitoring system that detects problems or potential problems in a network environment by comparing recent network operation with historical network operation summary of the invention  embodiments of the present invention provide a networkrelated monitoring system that detects problems or potential problems in a network environment by comparing current network operation and performance data to historical network operation and performance data the present invention is capable of monitoring the operation and performance of a network environment including various network devices in addition to monitoring an overall network environment embodiments of the

associated with operation of the network environment the network environment is analyzed by comparing the collected data with historical data associated with the operation of the network environment problems are identified based on the analysis of the network environment  in a particular embodiment of the invention the historical data is represented in multiple cognitive signatures  another embodiment of the invention updates the historical data to include the collected data  embodiments of the invention generate an alarm if a problem is identified  an embodiment of the invention

so as not to obscure the invention  the present invention is related to a networkrelated monitoring system that detects problems or potential problems in a network environment by comparing current network operation and performance data to historical network operation and performance data the monitoring system can be used to monitor the operation and performance of a network environment including various network devices as discussed herein network environment shall include all systems components subsystems network devices communication links applications and any other systems or components including both software and hardware coupled to or used in conjunction with a network  in addition to monitoring an overall network environment the monitoring system is able to monitor the operation and performance of specific devices such as network devices including various components or subsystems within a device for example embodiments of the invention are capable of monitoring the performance of a central processing unit cpu available memory and other device conditions the invention can also monitor applications running on one or more devices or systems eg monitoring application response time  the historical operation and performance data is updated regularly to reflect recent data collected regarding recent performance of the network andor devices being monitored additionally embodiments of the present invention consider threshold values both upper threshold limits and lower threshold limits when determining whether a problem or potential problem exists in a particular network environment thus the monitoring system uses both thresholds and dynamic historical data to detect problems or potential problems in a network environment  fig  illustrates an embodiment of a network environment in which the present invention can be implemented the network environment of fig  contains multiple network devices coupled to one another using a pair of networks  and  in particular a pair of workstations  and a pair of servers  are coupled to network  additionally a printer  and a network monitor  are coupled to network  a network device  such as a router bridge switch or gateway is coupled to both network  and network  network device  allows network data to be exchanged between network  and network  thereby allowing network devices coupled to network  to communicate with other network devices coupled to network  another pair of workstations  and a server  are also coupled to network  although fig  shows four workstations and three servers a particular network environment may contain any number of workstations servers printers or other network devices interconnected with one another in any configuration networks  and  may use any communication protocol and may utilize any network topology additionally network  and network  may use different protocols and different network topologies if different protocols or different topologies are used then network device  is required to translate or otherwise convert data between the two different protocols or two different topologies  network monitor  is coupled to network  but is capable of monitoring network devices interfaces and communication links associated with network  as well as network  network monitor  is also able to monitor the operation and performance of various subsystems components or applications contained within a network device for example network monitor  can monitor the cpu performance memory utilization and application response time of workstations and servers contained in the network environment although a single network monitor  is shown in fig  in an alternate embodiment of the invention a separate network monitor is coupled to

interfaces and communication links associated with network  in other embodiments of the invention a single network monitor  is capable of monitoring network devices interfaces and communication links associated with three or more different networks  fig  illustrates an exemplary network environment those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the teachings of the present invention can be used with any number of network environments and network configurations furthermore the teachings of the present invention can be used to monitor any network device system component or application for which information can be gathered either directly or indirectly additionally the present invention is capable of monitoring any communication link or interface within a network or between a network and a network device although fig  illustrates network monitor  as a separate network device network monitor  may be incorporated into another network device such as server   fig  illustrates an embodiment of a network monitor  capable of detecting problems or potential problems in a network environment network monitor  includes a data collection module  that collects information from various devices or applications such as information regarding network utilization or device utilization lost packets response time or number of errors data collection module  collects information regarding the operation or performance of the network environment on one or more communication links  data collection module  can collect data from any number of networks and any number of network devices or applications data collection module  is coupled to a data reduction module  which reduces the collected data by reducing the granularity of the data over time and performing statistical reduction of the data as discussed below  data reduction module  is coupled to a cognitive signature module  and a storage device  cognitive signature module  generates and maintains multiple dynamic cognitive signatures based on the data collected from the network a cognitive signature represents the normal operating mode for a particular network device network interface system application or communication link with which the cognitive signature is associated the cognitive signature is based on actual historical data collected regarding the operation and performance of the network environment the cognitive signature is dynamic such that it is continually updated to include the most recent data collected by the data collection module  in a particular embodiment of the invention a separate cognitive signature is provided for each day of the week a cognitive signature for a particular day of the week may include data separated into multiple time periods eg each hour of the day for example a cognitive signature for tuesday may include a particular time period that represents the normal operating mode based on collected historical data for a particular network device from  am to  am on tuesday a cognitive signature for saturday may include a time period that represents the normal operating mode for a particular network interface from  pm to  pm on saturday additional details regarding cognitive signatures are discussed below  in the embodiment of fig  cognitive signature module  receives data from data reduction module  in this embodiment the granularity of the collected data has already been reduced when received by cognitive signature module  in an alternate embodiment of the invention cognitive signature module  may receive data directly from data collection module  in this alternate embodiment cognitive signature module  receives the actual data collected rather than a reduced set of data thus the cognitive signatures can be generated using the actual data without any loss of detail due to averaging or other data reduction procedures  storage device  may be any type of mechanism capable of storing data such as a random access memory ram disk drive or tape drive storage device  is capable of receiving data from data reduction module  cognitive signature module  and an analysis module  analysis module  receives collected data from data collection module  and receives one or more cognitive signatures from cognitive signature module  analysis module  analyzes current performance or operation of the network environment by comparing the data collected via the network with the cognitive signatures which represent past performance or operation of the network environment at similar times for similar devices systems or applications analysis module  may also compare the current data collected with one or more threshold values analysis module  is coupled to an alarm generator  based on the results of the analysis performed by analysis module  an alarm signal may be communicated to alarm generator  in response to the alarm signal alarm generator  may generate an email message to a network administrator or other personnel initiate a page to a network administrators pager or communicate the alarm information to another system or application additionally alarm generator  may initiate a preprogrammed procedure that is executed in response to a particular type of alarm  fig  is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a procedure for detecting problems or potential problems in a network environment at step  data is collected from the network as discussed above the collected data may include various network performance and operation data such as network utilization and application response times the data is collected for example using data collection module  shown in fig  a request for information such as a status request is sent to one or more network devices or applications at various time intervals the request for information requests details regarding particular operation or performance parameters that are available from the network device or application for example the request for information may request the current utilization of each interface or network port on a particular network device or may determine the current response time for a particular application additionally the request for information may request details regarding the number of errors or discarded packets associated with each interface or port on a network device information can be collected from the various network devices and applications at regular time intervals such as every five minutes  the data collection module maintains a table or other collection of information to identify the various network devices and applications from which data is collected for each network device the table identifies the parameters or performance data to be requested and the time interval between requests thus the data collected from the network can be selective with respect to the network devices applications interfaces or communication ports within a particular device and with respect to polling time intervals  at step  the procedure reduces the data collected from the network in step  additional details regarding the reduction of the collected data is provided below with respect to fig  step  analyzes operation and performance by comparing the current data collected from the network ie the data representing the current performance or operation of the network environment with the cognitive signatures  ie the historical data regarding performance or operation of the network environment additional details regarding this analysis are provided below  at step  the procedure determines whether a problem or a potential problem has been detected based on the analysis performed in step  if a problem or a potential problem is not detected then the procedure branches to step  to generate andor modify the cognitive signatures based on data collected from the network and previous problem history the cognitive signatures are generated eg during an initialization period or modified to include the recent data collected this regular update of the cognitive signatures allows the cognitive signatures to be adjusted in response to changes in the operation and performance of the network environment  if a problem or a potential problem is detected in step  the procedure continues to step  where an alarm is generated indicating the problem or the potential problem detected step  also generates a problem history a problem history is maintained for each problem identified the problem history identifies information about the source and cause of the problem if known as well as the duration of the problem the problem history may also include the number of occurrences of the problem and may identify other problems that occurred at similar times thereby allowing the correlation of multiple problems  although an alarm is generated in  the alarm may not be communicated to the network administrator depending on the severity of the alarm further if a potential problem is detected the alarm may not be communicated to the network administrator depending on whether the potential problem is validated as an actual problem an alarm generator eg alarm generator  in fig  may determine whether to notify the network administrator and determine the manner in which the administrator is notified eg by email pager or other mechanism  step  of fig  generates or modifies the cognitive signatures based on data collected from the network as mentioned above the cognitive signatures are dynamic and continually updated as new data is collected from the network however in certain situations the cognitive signatures may not be updated for example if the collected data is significantly different than the associated cognitive signature eg indicating a significant problem then the cognitive signature may not be updated updating the cognitive signature in this atypical situation may skew the cognitive signature in another example if the collected data is slightly different than the associated cognitive signature eg indicating a potential minor problem then the cognitive signature may be update but the weighting provided to the current data is reduced thereby reducing the current datas affect on the cognitive signature  fig  is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a procedure for reducing data collected from a network at step  data is collected from one or more network devices or applications in a network at step  the procedure determines an average value a peak value and a minimum value for each of type of current data collected from the network  at step  the procedure stores the data collected from the network during the past period in five minute samples at step  the procedure identifies data collected from the network during the past four weeks but not the past  hours and reduces the granularity of the data to one hour samples thus rather than storing twelve values each hour five minute samples the twelve values are consolidated into a single value representing the entire hour this reduction in data granularity significantly reduces the storage space required for this older data thus the twelve average values for each parameter are consolidated into a single average value similarly the twelve peak values and the twelve minimum values are consolidated into a single peak value and a single minimum value respectively  step  identifies data collected from the network during the past three months but not the past four weeks and reduces the granularity of the data to four hour samples this further reduction in data granularity further reduces the storage space required to maintain the historical data step  identifies data collected from the network more than three months ago and reduces the granularity of the data to one day samples thus the data granularity is reduced as the age of the data increases the manner in which data is reduced may vary from one device to another or from one interface to another fig  illustrates one data reduction procedure that can be used with the present invention those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that numerous other data reduction procedures may be utilized with the present invention furthermore in alternate embodiments of the invention data reduction procedures are not used although these alternate embodiments require additional storage space for the collected data they provide increased data granularity ie increased detail  fig  illustrates an embodiment of a cognitive signature module eg module  shown in fig  cognitive signature module  includes a cognitive signature generator  that creates and modifies multiple cognitive signatures as discussed above a separate cognitive signature is typically used for each device application or interface in a network environment additionally separate cognitive signature values can be maintained for different time periods on different days of the week cognitive signature generator  receives various information regarding network operation including cognitive signatures  and exception information  this information is received by cognitive signature generator  on data path  cognitive signatures  represent the operation and performance of the network environment based on data collected during previous weeks cognitive signatures  are received from for example data collection module  or data reduction module  fig   cognitive signatures  are adjusted as necessary to ignore data during time periods when the network is down or when significant components of the network eg a router or a server are down or offline for example if several network servers are down for maintenance from  pm to  pm on a particular friday the portion of the cognitive signature associated with that time period on friday is not adjusted when several network servers are down data collected from the network is likely to be significantly different from the data that would be collected if the servers were operating for example response time may increase significantly when a network device is down or malfunctioning updating the cognitive signature in this situation would incorrectly skew the cognitive signatures thus rather than incorporating this atypical information into the cognitive signatures one or more network parameters are ignored during the time period during which the network servers are down therefore the cognitive signatures associated with these network parameters is not changed  exception information  contains network operation and performance data regarding infrequent events and events that do not follow a regular pattern for example if an increase in network utilization occurs every monday from  am am the information is included in a cognitive signature because the event occurs on a regular basis however other events may occur on an irregular basis for example a significant increase in network utilization may occur on the last business day of each month similarly a significant decrease in network utilization may occur on holidays these irregular but schedulable events are not incorporated into the cognitive signatures  and instead are stored as separate exception information  cognitive signature generator  creates and maintains separate cognitive signatures for each event that occurs on an irregular but schedulable basis thus when selecting an appropriate cognitive signature for use in analyzing current network operation and performance cognitive signature generator  considers both cognitive signatures  and exception information   cognitive signature generator  also produces signature correlation factors  which indicate the degree of correlation associated with each cognitive signature the signature correlation factors indicate based on historical data the likelihood that a particular network parameter will fall within the range of values defined by the cognitive signature certain performance data may be relatively constant from one week to the next during a particular time period for example network utilization between  am and  am on saturday may be between five percent and ten percent with very infrequent deviations in this example the signature correlation factor may be  indicating that there is a  percent likelihood that the collected data associated with the cognitive signature will be within the range of values specified by the cognitive signature  in another situation a particular cognitive signature may not be highly correlated indicating that the collected data varies significantly for example network utilization between  am and  am on monday may vary between  percent and  percent in this situation the correlation factor may be   signature correlation factors are used when analyzing collected data and determining whether to activate an alarm additionally the signature correlation factors are used to determine the severity of an alarm for example if the current data collected is outside the cognitive signature by ten percent and the cognitive signature is highly correlated then the situation is considered an unusual event and may cause the generation of an alarm if the current data collected is outside the cognitive signature by  percent then the situation is considered a serious event however if the cognitive signature is not highly correlated then data that is ten percent outside the cognitive signature is not considered to be an important event and does not trigger an alarm when the cognitive signature is not highly correlated the current data may need to be outside the cognitive signature by  percent or more before an alarm is generated additional details regarding the analysis of collected data including the use of signature correlation factors are discussed below  various cognitive signature tools  are available for use by cognitive signature generator  cognitive signature tools  can be used to update exception information such as identifying upcoming holidays or scheduled down times for servers or other devices in the network environment cognitive signature tools  can also modify cognitive signatures to “undo” the effects of data collected during a particular time period for example if a network failure occurred during a particular time period and performance data for that time period was integrated into the cognitive signatures a tool can be activated to remove the effects of this data from the cognitive signature this tool thereby eliminates any skewing of the cognitive signature due to the network failure  fig a illustrates an exemplary cognitive signature  in a graphical manner embodiments of the invention store the cognitive signature values in a table or other data structure that is easily accessed by a processing device cognitive signatures are not necessarily stored in a graphical manner fig a illustrates cognitive signature  graphically for purposes of explanation cognitive signature  includes three components an average line a a peak line b and a minimum line c the peak and minimum lines b and c define a band or range of values that generally define “typical” values for the parameter associated with cognitive signature  cognitive signature  is associated with a particular day of the week eg tuesday and a particular network parameter eg network utilization  referring to fig a the horizontal axis represents timeofday and the vertical axis represents the utilization of the network measured from zero percent to  percent cognitive signature  shows that network utilization is generally highest around  am and  am thus a high network utilization at  am on a tuesday might not represent a problem since the utilization parameter is within cognitive signature  ie between the peak line b and the minimum line c however a high network utilization at  pm on tuesday represents a problem or a potential problem because cognitive signature  indicates that historically network utilization has not been high at that time similarly a low network utilization at  am on tuesday may indicate a problem because cognitive signature  indicates that the network utilization has historically been high at that time therefore cognitive signature  is used to identify problems when the associated parameter exceeds peak line b or falls below minimum line c  as discussed above data is collected from the network at various intervals eg every five minutes cognitive signature  may contain all of the data collected from the network eg five minute samples or may be reduced to less frequent intervals eg one hour samples if using one hour samples cognitive signature  will include three values average peak and minimum for each interval thus all data collected during the one hour period is represented by three values it will be appreciated that time intervals of any size can be used to generate a cognitive signature as discussed above in a particular embodiment of the invention a separate cognitive signature is maintained for each day of the week in combination with each monitored parameter thus separate cognitive signatures are provided for network utilization on tuesday network utilization on wednesday application response time on tuesday application response time on wednesday and so forth a network monitoring system can maintain hundreds or thousands of cognitive signatures depending on the number of network environment parameters being monitored  fig b is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a procedure for generating and modifying cognitive signatures when a network monitor first begins monitoring a network environment or begins monitoring a new network device no cognitive signature exists with which the current collected data can be compared thus in step  of fig b an initialization process is performed to initialize the cognitive signatures and the cognitive signature correlation factors step  also collects information regarding the network environment including information regarding various network devices systems and applications during the initialization period cognitive signatures are generated using the collected data since no historical data is available for the same period in previous weeks the current data may be compared to the cognitive signature data associated with the previous hour or the previous day after the initialization process has collected data for seven days cognitive signatures will be available for all time periods on each day of the week at this point current data collected from the network is compared to the appropriate cognitive signatures  at step  the procedure collects data eg performance data from the network this collected data is referred to as the current data at step  the procedure identifies exception information and determines whether the current data is within an exception period exception periods include holidays maintenance periods scheduled down times for one or more network devices and similar irregular events the exception information can be stored in a table or other data structure and includes the start time and end time of the exception period the exception information also includes the action to be taken during the exception information for example the action may be to ignore all data collected during the exception period ie do not generate alarms or update cognitive signatures or apply a different weighting to the collected data when updating the cognitive signatures different action may be taken depending on the parameter being monitored or the network device or application providing the data for example a scheduled down time for a particular device may cause data associated with that device to be ignored while data associated with other devices is handled in the normal manner  if the current data is within an exception period then the procedure branches from step  to step  to take the appropriate action associated with the exception period if the current data is not within an exception period then the procedure continues from step  to step  to update the cognitive signature based on the existing cognitive signature and the current data in a particular embodiment of the invention the cognitive signature values for the period associated with the current data is updated according to the following formulanew cogsigold cogsigweightcurrent dataweight in this embodiment two different weighting values are used weight and weight these weighting values represent percentages and when added together total  percent in a particular embodiment of the invention emphasis is placed on the historical data ie the old cognitive signature values in this embodiment weight is  and weight is  thereby placing a significant emphasis on the historical data it will be appreciated that various other weighting values may be used depending on the emphasis desired for historical data the weighting values may vary between different devices systems or applications as discussed above in certain situations eg when a serious alarm is generated the existing cognitive signature is not updated to avoid improperly skewing the cognitive signature values  after updating the cognitive signature the procedure of fig b continues to step  to update the cognitive signature correlation factors the cognitive signature correlation factors are updated by comparing the current data to the associated cognitive signature for example if the current data is within the cognitive signature then the correlation factor is updated to indicate an increased correlation similarly if the current data is not within the cognitive signature then the correlation factor is updated to indicate a decreased correlation  fig  illustrates an embodiment of an analysis module  analysis module  includes a network operation and performance analyzer  that monitors a network environment and identifies problems or potential problems in the network environment analyzer  receives current data  one or more cognitive signatures  one or more analysis rules  exception information  and signature correlation factors  current data  is received for example from data collection module  shown in fig  current data may be communicated to analysis module  via a data link between data collection module  or storage device  and current data  cognitive signatures  exception information  and signature correlation factors  are received for example from cognitive signature module  analysis rules  include one or more rules that compare the current data to one or more cognitive signatures or threshold values several exemplary rules are provided belowif networkutilizationpeakhistoricalutilization then alarmif networkutilizationpeakhistoricalutilization then alarmif applicationresponsetimethreshold then alarm the first rule generates an alarm alarm if the current network utilization exceeds the peak historical utilization as defined by the cognitive signature for the current time period alarm indicates the event that caused the alarm network utilization exceeding peak historical utilization as well as the network devices associated with the parameter network utilization associated with the alarm the second rule generates a different alarm alarm if the current network utilization exceeds the peak historical utilization by  percent alarm is associated with a more serious event because the current data significantly exceeds the cognitive signature thus if both alarm and alarm are identified by the analysis rules alarm may be ignored because alarm is a more serious event the third rule generates an alarm alarm if a particular application response time exceeds a threshold value threshold threshold may be a static value that causes an alarm to be generated when the threshold is exceeded regardless of any cognitive signature associated the applications response time thus analysis rules are used to apply both dynamic cognitive signatures and static threshold values a particular analysis rule may apply both cognitive signatures and threshold values to one or more network environment parameters  other analysis rules consider signature correlation factors as well as cognitive signatures or threshold values for exampleif networkutilizationpeakhistoricalutilization and signaturecorrelationfactor then alarm in the above example the analysis rule generates an alarm alarm if the current network utilization exceeds the peak historical utilization and the cognitive signature associated with network utilization has a high correlation factor ie above  percent alarm indicates a serious event because network utilization is typically highly correlated but the current data has exceeded the cognitive signature values for the current time period an analysis rule may use any combination of current data cognitive signatures correlation factors and exception information  network operation and performance analyzer  shown in fig  compares the current data with one or more cognitive signatures or thresholds to determine whether a problem or a potential problem exists in the network environment this comparison is performed by applying one or more analysis rules as discussed above if a problem or a potential problem is identified analyzer  communicates information regarding the alarm to an alarm generator or other device responsible for providing notification of the problem or potential problem the information regarding the alarm is communicated across a link  in one embodiment of the invention the alarm generator takes an appropriate action based on the alarm information received and information contained in a table or other mechanism that associates particular alarm information with a particular action in another embodiment of the invention alarm generator may consider other information in addition to the received alarm information when determining the appropriate action in this embodiment the alarm generator may contain additional logic or analysis procedures that determine the appropriate action to perform if any additional details regarding the alarm generator is provided below with respect to figs  and   network operation and performance analyzer  is also coupled to network analyzer tools  tools  are used to obtain additional information regarding a problem or a potential problem for example tools are available to adjust the polling rate of a particular device system or application the polling rate may be adjusted based on network utilization as network utilization increases polling may decrease to avoid further congestion of the network communication links additionally the polling rate may be adjusted based on detection of a problem with a particular network device polling may be increased to closely monitor the operation of the particular network device other tools are available to trace a path between two devices or systems in a network environment for example if a particular device is not responding the tool may test all devices interfaces and communication links between the network monitor and the particular device if all other devices interfaces and communication links between the network monitor and the nonresponsive device are functioning properly then the problem is with the nonresponsive device itself network analyzer tools  may also include tools for setting threshold values and creating or modifying analysis rules  fig  is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a procedure for analyzing performance or operation of a network environment at step  one or more analysis rules are applied to the current data collected from the network as discussed above the analysis rules perform various analysis of the current data in relation to cognitive signatures or thresholds step  determines whether the current data collected from the network is within the associated cognitive signatures if the current data is within the associated cognitive signatures the procedure returns to step  to await the collection of the next set of data from the network  if the current data is not within the associated cognitive signatures the procedure continues from step  to step  to determine the deviation of the current data from the associated cognitive signatures and the duration of the deviation if the current data deviates only slightly from the cognitive signature it may be ignored or treated as a minor event however if the deviation is significant the deviation may be treated as an important or serious event if the duration of the deviation is small eg only a few minutes the deviation may be ignored or treated as a minor event but if the duration of the deviation is significant eg several hours the deviation may be treated as an important or serious event step  compares the deviation of the current data to the cognitive signature correlation factors as discussed above the signature correlation factors can be used to determine the severity of the deviation based on the historical correlation of the cognitive signature although steps   and  are shown as three separate steps they may be combined into a single step eg by applying analysis rules that compare the current data to the cognitive signatures as well as determining deviation from the cognitive signature and considering the signature correlation factors the analysis results generated by the procedure shown in fig  are then used by other systems and procedures discussed herein to determine whether a problem or a potential problem exists and whether an alarm should be generated  in one embodiment of the invention step  in fig  also determines whether the current data is within the cognitive signature for the previous time period or within the cognitive signature for the next time period thus step  compares the current data to three different cognitive signatures ie the cognitive signatures for the previous current and next time periods by comparing the current data to the previous time period and the next time period the procedure is able to identify a pattern or event that is shifted in time for example a high network utilization may typically occur between  pm and  pm if a high network utilization occurs between  pm and  pm the procedure may not consider it to be unusual because high network utilization typically occurs during the next time period by analyzing adjacent cognitive signatures the procedure is able to avoid generating false alarms when a typical pattern or event has been shifted in time to an adjacent time period  fig  illustrates an embodiment of an alarm generator alarm generator  includes an alarm analyzer  that receives alarm information from an analysis module eg analysis module  in fig  indicating the type of alarm and the severity of the alarm the alarm information is received on a link  the alarm type may indicate whether the problem is a hardware problem or a software problem or may indicate the type of device or application in which the problem was identified the alarm type may also indicate the parameter eg network utilization that triggered the alarm the severity of the alarm indicates whether the problem is a significant problem that requires immediate attention a minor problem that should be monitored or a moderate problem that should receive attention when a network administrator is available  alarm analyzer  is coupled to alarm notification policy  and alarm action module  alarm notification policy  identifies the manner in which a network administrator or other individual is notified of an alarm additionally alarm notification policy  may identify a particular action to take in response to an alarm the manner in which notice is provided may depend on the type of alarm or the severity of the alarm a severe alarm may cause a network administrator to be paged or otherwise immediately contacted whereas a minor alarm may provide notice to the network administrator via email or other lower priority mechanism alarm action module  implements the types of actions to take in response to various alarms actions include resetting a network device or application or deactivating particular interfaces or communication links that are experiencing problems based on the received alarm information and the alarm notification policy alarm analyzer  determines how to handle the alarm and communicates the action to alarm action module   alarm analyzer  is also able to correlate multiple events into a single alarm or a single problem certain events are predictable in response to other events for example an increase in network utilization generally causes an increase in response time and an increase in network errors thus if network utilization increases significantly and at approximately the same time response time increases then the two events utilization and response time increase may be treated as a single event similarly if several devices along a common path experience common problems eg a communication problem on the path the events may be treated as a singe event rather than multiple individual events also errors on multiple interfaces of a device may be treated as a single event because a problem with the device may be the cause of all interface errors  alarm action module  includes multiple modules capable of communicating an alarm or other problem indicator to a network administrator or other individual or system an electronic mail generator  is capable of generating and sending an email message identifying various information about the problem or alarm for example the email message may include information regarding the type of problem the severity of the problem and the likely source of the problem if known the email message is sent to one or more network administrators managers or other personnel across a communication link  a paging module  may generate and send a pager message to one or more pagers eg pagers carried by a network administrator or other individual responsible for handling problems in the network environment paging module  communicates the pager message across communication link  in one embodiment paging module  automatically dials the appropriate pager number and communicates the message to the pager in another embodiment paging module  communicates the pager number and message to another device across communication link  which then generates the page  an alarm communicator  is capable of communicating alarm information to another device or system across communication link  additionally alarm communicator  is capable of activating an application or process such as an executable code sequence the application may be located on the network monitor or on any another device or system in the network environment the particular application activated is determined by the information contained in alarm notification policy  andor alarm action module  several different applications may be executed depending on the type of alarm source of the problem or type of parameter that triggered the alarm for example alarm communicator  can reset a device subsystem or component that may be the source of a problem after taking this action analysis module  will analyze network operation and performance to determine whether the problem has been corrected  fig  is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a procedure for generating an alarm based on analysis of the network environment at step  alarm information is received from an analysis module eg analysis module  in fig  step  identifies the type of problem the severity of the problem the source of the problem if known and the event or activity that triggered the alarm step  then determines the appropriate action to take if any based on the received alarm information and the alarm notification policy the appropriate action may include generating a pager message an email message or activating another application or procedure for example an email message can be used to communicate information regarding minor problems or other events that do not require immediate attention a pager message is generated for all important alarms and all serious alarms such that a network administrator or other individual is immediately notified of the problem an application can be activated by the alarm generator to take an action appropriate for the alarm  step  determines whether any action is required if the alarm is a minor alarm the alarm generator may ignore the alarm and not take action unless the alarm continues for a significant period of time or increases in severity if action is required the procedure continues to step  which branches to one of three different steps depending on the appropriate action determined in step  if the appropriate action is an email the procedure branches to step  which generates and sends an email message to the appropriate recipients if the appropriate action is a pager message the procedure branches to step  which generates and sends a pager message to the appropriate recipients if the appropriate action is the communication of alarm information to another device or application the procedure branches to step  which communicates alarm information to another system or application step  may also activate an application or procedure on the network monitor or other device in the network environment although steps   and  are shown as alternative steps a particular alarm may trigger any or all of the steps for example a serious alarm or serious problem may cause the generation and sending of both an email message and a pager message as well as the activation of an application or procedure  fig
