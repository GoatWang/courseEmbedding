under my eyes ever since i can remember of course since im not getting any younger they werent getting any better plus in that certain horrific lighting i could see the hollows were very uneven one side was worse the other side went down further i was scared to death of getting any type of injections because of the risks or side effects well after several years of hearing you look tired you look sick didnt you get any sleep etc i finally decided to go for it last friday which was  days ago i went to the dermatologist that my friend recommended to me katz dermatologist dr katz do the consulting and discussed the treatment that i will undergo now i understand everyone is different but wow i had no bruising and no swelling that i could see he injected it deep onto the bone he used half a syringe although i probably couldnt used more we both agreed to leave it as is for now and if i wanted in a couple weeks he could add more the hollows are nowhere near as pronounced as they were i will definitely be doing this again very nice improvement dr katz was conservative and wants to give me an improvement in the area that i’m having a problem with and instead of overfilling you and making more money in one shot he did a good jobkatz dermatologyharoldjames ratedi was on vacation last nov  prior i’d lost  pounds but for the first time not so happy with my face im a  years old felt i had a few wrinkles pale no pores showing but i started moisturizing at  never went to bed with makeup i am a half french and a half italian so i decide to treat this wrinkles with a facial dr katz dermatology it was been recommended to me by my friend dr katz studied my skin thought it in good shape for my age and not getting regular facials he thought i should have one every other month he took off my makeup then massage a cold cream into my skin placed a warm sage smelling towel on my face cleaned the cream off then applied a silver mask there was a machine with rolling balls that massaged deeply felt terrific he also applied creams to my neck and declotte and did a great job on my hands then left gloves on that after many steaming after each step and the incredible smelling towels i was done he cleaned up my eyebrows and massaged a serum into my face then handed me the mirror i thought id had a face lift seriously i then realized that the eye lift id been putting off had caused deep wrinkles across my forehead and nose they were completely gone i’m serious not a single wrinkle and this lasted till beginning of jan so happykatz dermatologybobbygraham ratedi have been suffering to acne since i was in my teenage years before i sought treatment i saw three different dermatologists and no one made my scarring gone myself esteemed was shot and i was all afraid to face a mirror then my friend recommended to me dr katz during my consultation i was blown away by his knowledge we started the treatment right away and after  weeks we already seen the result i can’t see the scarring  doctors did nothing to improve the scarring and then dr katz makes them basically disappear i strongly recommend dr katz to anyone with acne scarring he offers a variety of treatment options and can gear different options to your type of scarring he cares about his patients and is always adding a special touch whether it is asking about my pooch to remembering things i told him in the past i know with how i have been treated by him and his dedicated staff that anyone seeking any procedure will be very happy with the experience and the results thank you dr katz for making me feel beautifulkatz dermatologyrosetteturner ratedi had a treatment it’s a permanent injectable i had it under the eye area and also along the jaw line its not my first time with dr katz but it is my first time with this particular treatment the reason that i came in was seven years ago i had a procedure and my results from another doctor had not been to my approval i had some awful like rippling effects under the eye and it just was not smooth ive done treatments trying to correct it and ive never left the house without a makeup on because of how concerned i am with the look of those results in the past i found dr katz and weve been doing some restylane injections around my temple area and brow bone area trying to fill in some of the areas around that eye area that i was concerned with he and i discussed injecting the treatment which is better its a more permanent solution to cover up that rippling effect ive looked in the mirror and im ecstatic what my results are and im really happy with the resultskatz dermatologymatthewhabel ratedthis is a great dermatology clinic ever i have been to dermatologists all over the state and i have suffered from adult cystic acne for years i have been on antibiotics accutane i have tried everything nothing worked i made an appointment with dr katz and i found his office to be a refreshing and informative experience he is very professional and specific he listened to my medical history and all my concerns i have a new found faith in modern doctors dr katz made me feel very comfortable and relaxed they opened my mind and eyes to fixing my skin problems i feel hopeful that dr katz really does want to help people that suffer with skin problems he offered her treatments and alternatives to products i was currently using this office does not pressure you make drastic changes to your life or wallet the office is easy to locate the office is nice clean and welcoming the staff is also nice and helpful i will definitely recommend this clinic to allkatz dermatologysamanthalei ratedmy skin has been breaking out like crazy ever since finals last december i havent broken out like this since i first came here but im assuming its stress and hormone related the inflammation has been pretty constant since then so i set up an appt asap had i just been consistent i probably could have saved myself the new breakouts and scars from my understanding and research it does take about  months for acne to form so all these suckers have been creeping there way up to the surface and face reality tries their best to extract the hell out of them in conjunction with their homecare regimen i really have to commend their customer service here at katz dermatology other than that their products really do work so it’s important that you follow the regimen dr katz will give you i recommend anyone to come here my skin is perfectly clearkatz dermatologyjeaniepres ratedi found out that dr katz could help me about some complexion issues i was concerned about and he took the time much more than i usually spend with any kind of doctor to explain everything to me and recommended several products to help including affordable overthecounter and available at drugstores and facial cleansers moisturizers he also gave me several samples and coupons for said items which was very helpful i felt very comfortable and he addressed all of my concerns and wanted to really educate me about how to take care of my skin he also gave me some general advice for my skin and hair information was made available to me about laser hair removal i look forward to seeing the results in a few weeks from my new regimen either way i feel confident that this office would continue working with me to get the results im afterkatz dermatologymarkav ratedi was terribly scared in an alarplasty gone wrong by my last procedure my face was uneven botched and scared so bad i had a hard time leaving my house when i had an initial visit with dr katz we came up with a game plan that he also talked over with colleagues i wasnt a typical case we scheduled the procedure and the office helped me stay comfortable and at ease during the whole time after the surgery i knew it was going to look good keep in mind i have had the doc prior to dr katz do this on me  times to keep trying to fix and re fix the damage so i could tell right away it was aligned even and my suchers were placed evenly  weeks after and i am so happy i thought i was going to have to live with that horrible disfigurement for the rest of my lifethank you dr katz i am so happy dr katz saved my facekatz dermatologytonyschimdt ratedi am  years old and have lost volume in my face causing me to look older than i think i should i went to katz dermatology for advice on what to do to achieve a more youthful appearance i ended up having among other things dr katz suggested to me radiesse injections for my cheeks to replace the volume and i am thrilled with the look he applied some topical numbing cream and it really didnt hurt much at all dr katz is an excellent in injecting me on my cheeks he is very careful not to over inject me i loved the instant results i also had the mixto laser treatment all over my face and juvederm in my lips it sounds like a lot but the outcome is just a younger fresher looking me it did not alter my face in a way that would make people ask what did you do i feel so much better about how i lookkatz dermatologyfelixm ratedi have used juvederm for both my lips and my nasolabial folds i had my lips done initially about a year ago with resylane and was really unhappy with the results so i did more research and visited a dr katz who took all the time he needed to find out exactly what i wanted he spent time taking pictures looking at my face talking it all out this time we decided together on a full syringe distributed between my lips and my nasiolabial folds the dr katz used a numbing gel on my lips and laugh lines he then had the nurse shoot cold air on the spots he was working on i did not feel a thing at allnothing he also gave me pills to take home for  days i love love the results dr katz left me with literally no bruising no pain and such minimal swelling i felt totally normal going out the same nightdid you knowphysicians and surgeons help to keep people  from infants to the elderly  as healthy as possible

again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give
