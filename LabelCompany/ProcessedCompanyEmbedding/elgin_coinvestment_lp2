watch company serial number elgin pocket watch home elgin national watch company in the spring of  half a dozen ambitious chicago businessmen decided that if massachusetts could build a factory that built watches – illinois could too harper’s magazine summed their sentiment perfectly “it was the genuine audacious selfreliant western spirit” by august of that year this consortium including thenchicago mayor benjamin w raymond purchased an abandoned farm  miles north of chicago and built a watch factory there after a year of designing and building the lathes and machines to achieve seemingly impossible levels of precision a team of watchmakers and mechanical engineers produced their first pocket watch movement named for mayor “bw raymond” the watch was exquisite elgin national watch company was born by  word of elgin’s obsession with precision had spread around the world elgin engineers built their own observatory to maintain scientifically precise times in their watches later their accurate “wristlet” watches proved to be vital to the wwi war effort helping to fuel a craze back in the states for something called “the wrist watch” by the opulent jazz age if you weren’t displaying the exuberant symmetry of an elgin wrist watch or carrying a svelte distinctive elgin pocket watch then who were you elgin had helped define the american pocket watch as unsurpassed in “railroad accuracy” by  the post civil war dream factory imagined by a handful of american entrepreneurs had produced  million “time machines” during world war ii all civilian manufacturing was halted and the company moved into the defense industry manufacturing military watches chronometers fuses for artillery shells altimeters and other aircraft instruments and sapphire bearings used for aiming cannons while their altruism was vital to the war effort elgin’s patriotism ironically opened an opportunity for the swiss by  after a midcentury decade that saw the rise of the elite “lord and lady elgin” series the original elgin factory closed over the course of a century the dream factory just north of chicago had produced half of all jeweled pocket and wristwatches manufactured in the united states the legendary elgin watch has become woven into the fabric of america robert johnson preeminent delta bluesman sang “she’s got elgin movements from her head down to her toes” in his  recording of “walkin’ blues” nba hall of famer elgin baylor was named after the elgin national watch company daniel beard’s sketches of an angel at the end of a connecticut yankee in king arthur’s

advisors today are facing some tough choices on behalf of their clients they demand alternatives to the traditional equityfixed interest portfolio mix yet so many alternative funds have overpromised and underdelivered many have suffered large losses and others are often illiquid or in the extreme even fraudulent in an age where every investment house tries to position a new fund with “unique and special” qualities in order to market it  financial advisors have become very cynical and sceptical about a fund’s true value  after all many funds have been dubious and ended up doing everything but what was promised  being unable to find a reliable liquid and costeffective solution from the universe of alternative funds we created one years of research and proven excellence in due diligence result in one strategically conceived investment fund giving access to a small selection of elite institutional managers otherwise out of reach of retail investors where grandmaster is indeed unique is that it was initially created only for use in the alternative portion of our own investors’ portfolios in order to give them access to top funds with very large minimum entry levels of m as a result our analysts truly sought what we believe are the best hedge funds – most of which are used as the private pot of the managers significant coinvestment by the principals and where the outside
