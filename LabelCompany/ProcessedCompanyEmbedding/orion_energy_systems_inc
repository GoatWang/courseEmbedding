modular  ldrm source company website opportunity with approximately one billion fluorescent lighting troffers in the united states the market for led retrofitting is huge troffers derived from the words trough and coffer are lighting fixtures typically installed with drop ceilings in retail and office environments the troffer lighting system has been termed the workhorse of retail and office environments fluorescent troffers typically are configured in  x  and  x  varieties with one two or four fluorescent bulbs or tubes in each fixture the older and likely the most common  x  troffer typically contains four  watt fluorescent bulbs consuming  watts of electricity generally firstgeneration led lighting products did not offer optimum characteristics satisfying consumer preferences for light output and color temperature much has changed in the led lighting field to offer products that offer good light output and color quality as well as output and optical control vastly outperforming fluorescent predecessors that have been around since the s with led end users have the opportunity to not only improve lighting features and reduce energy consumption but further reduce consumption with dimming and control systems offered in secondgeneration products orion energy systems nysemktoesx has been designing and selling troffer lighting systems since  when the company purchased harris lighting a jacksonville florida company that specialized in officeretail lighting with the launch of the new product shown in the above picture orion is now in the second generation of led retrofit products for the troffer space the orion ison™ ldr® troffer retrofit modular termed the lrrm is an architectural contour design with improved appearance and output the unit consumes between  watts and  watts per fixture depending on the light output version chosen depending on the model chosen energy savings would range between  and  for an led retrofit from a  watt fluorescent unit to illustrate the market opportunity in the troffer retrofit space by assigning an arbitrary number of  per unit would yield a market value of about  billion just in the retrofit business the us department of energy estimated that as of  only about  of linear fluorescent lighting had been retrofitted to led evidencing the early stage of adoption in process orion energy systems has a month revenue run rate of only  million including all product segments for commercial industrial parking and other applications industrial has remained orions strongest segment since its inception however led troffers could significantly increase its market share in the commercial space while the author has written a number of articles on oesx the fundamental performance of the company arguably deserves a much higher price than the current range near  which may offer an impressive outsized return in the coming months the launch of the new ldre and ldrm products in themselves could drive significantly improved results and stock price as will be illustrated below innovation is key led lighting has been around awhile however in the very early stage of development both in product development and adoption the dynamics are changing daily new product introductions have exploded across all segments of bulbs tubes fixtures sensors control systems and other components success in the business will be achieved by true innovators that develop advanced products which add value to end users achieve differentiation and build brand preference with its recent product launch announcement orion continues to prove its ability to innovate with products otherwise unavailable in the market new orion products and why they matter in  orion launched a new led troffer retrofit unit it called the led door retrofit or ldr installation pictured below the product was innovative in that the original fluorescent components could be removed from the troffer followed by inserting two brackets and placing the led unit inside the frame the unit originally used the existing lens style to complete the conversion to led which was later eclipsed by new contour designs the ldr earned a distinction as an awardwinning product that laid the groundwork for further enhancements the product installed and worked well but with little improvement in aesthetic appearance since the introduction of the ldr both new construction and retrofit led troffer units on the market have transitioned to an improved contour design which offers improvements in both performance and appearance picture shown on title page installing ldr source company presentation a company announcement on april  previewed the launch of two new contour design led troffer retrofit products that are termed game changers by the company in stating that the units can be installed in about one minute in about the same time required to change the bulbs the two new products are detailed below  the new ison ldr® troffer retrofit modular ldrm unit offers a stepchange in advanced features as will be further evidenced below there is nothing comparable to it on the market today the ldrm offers the advantages of the led conversion with the most uptodate contour design performance and easy install within  minutes while other units on the market claim easytoinstall features no other product comes close to a oneminute install installing a few led troffer retrofits units may not make much difference however when  units are installed in an office complex setting it is a big deal furthermore the ldrm can be upgraded with a new light engine as technology advances making the item futureproof as the company describes it complete information on the ldrm is provided on the company website here some of the key product features include patented modular design assembled complete from the factory powdercoated  minute installation with no tools required light engine can be upgraded as technology improves without replacing the complete unit smart components that enable hundreds of factory or fieldinstalled options available including battery backup dimming drivers sensors wireless connection and mobile technologies which enable connection to any it system  rated life maintenance free year warranty a copy of a portion of the sell sheet for the ison ldrm is pasted below which illustrates the simple step installation  the new harris ldr® troffer retrofit edge ldre modular unit has the lowest installed cost of any complete unit offered by the company detailed documentation of the product on the company website can be found here the harris version pictured below appears similar to the ison unit with contour modular design harris led retrofit edge  ldre source company website a key difference between the ison and harris versions is that the light engine in the ison unit is upgradeable while that in the harris unit is not however the harris unit offers the most economical alternative on an installed basis the harris ldre offers a  rated life and a year warranty both the ldrm and ldre offer multiple choices in lumen output ranging between  and  actual lumens and lumens per watt ranging between  and  as well as color temperature options sensors and controls other key features of both the ison and harris products include optional controls and sensors enabling connectivity with the internet and big data connected lighting systems are quickly becoming part of the overall it system for organizations compared to fluorescent led lighting provides much greater control in dimming and other output features which are increasingly part of smart connected building systems however with the introduction of its latest suite of products orion has moved its product offering to the next level of control and connectivity instead of using its proprietary offerings the company elected to partner with the best in class lutron electronics and enlightened incorporated for dimming driver options controls and sensors lutron and enlightened are recognized leaders in their respective markets the new partnerships timed with the launch of the ldrm and ldre offer a compelling total product offering and opportunity as orion enters fiscal  which began on april  the led lighting market landscape all of the largest lighting suppliers like general electric nysege cooper lightingeaton nyseetn philips nysephg acuity nyseayi and others offer led troffer retrofit kits that are installed as components with claimed installation times running from  to  minutes however none offer a product comparable to the orion ldrm and ldre in terms of installation likely the closest alternative philips supplies a modular unit it calls the evokit which is a component contour unit according to the company the evokit can be installed by an experienced installer in about five to ten minutes a philips installation video is linked here an online search for pricing of a  x  philips evokit resulted in retail prices ranging from about  to  not including shipping while orion products are sold in bb transactions which do not lend well to retail comparisons the company has indicated the prices of the ldre are in line with that of the philips evokit however since the evokit must be assembled by installers on site requiring tools and a great deal more time the ldre offers significant advantage its all about the troffer in most of its history the troffer has offered a suitable lighting source at an economically viable cost but with lackluster appearance the new modular led troffers enable an improved appearance in addition to lower energy consumption the new orion ldre and ldrm which can be installed in about the same time it would take to change the bulbs should be a game changer most businesses have an assortment of luminary fixtures which may include office retail factory distribution exterior parking and egress signage but if they have an office they likely have troffers due to the sheer numbers of troffers and the fact that troffers are present in most businesses a gamechanging product should help drive sales across the orion product lineup which includes products for commercial industrial retail government education healthcare transportation and other categories the foregoing opens up an entire market for orion that did not exist just a few years ago in past years orions revenue has typically ramped up disproportionately in the rd and th fiscal quarters ending in december and march due to yearend budget spends by industrial clients before the company purchased harris lighting in  it was not in the troffers business many customers with a heavy concentration in troffers like schools and other institutional customers tend to make facility changes and upgrades during summer months other entities like government and healthcare organizations may update infrastructure at any time during the year as a result sales of troffers should result in a more evenly distributed and predictable revenue stream throughout the year since entering the troffers business orion management has provided lower gross margin guidance for the troffer segment compared to high bay lighting products which have been the companys mainstay lower gross margins for troffers have resulted from commoditytype products and intense competition in the space during q management stated that the margins on troffer retrofit products should increase after the launch of new products in calendar  the ldre and ldrm appear to be the new products mentioned and accordingly should drive margins higher as a common tenet innovation drives higher gross margins and value for end users but beyond margins the advanced competitively priced ldrm and ldre should offer a boost in pulling the entire orion product line through the channel nearterm prospects since orions q reported results december  were a huge disappointment to investors with a  drop in yoy revenue it remains uncertain what q and fullyear fiscal  ended march  will look like while the company booked revenue of  million in q  management has indicated that the majority of a  ford motor company nysef po would book in q albeit with a lower gross margin during the q earnings conference call management indicated softness in the business confirmed by a deteriorating pmi purchasing managers index figure below  which signifies contraction in business procurement recently the index has begun to trend up as evidenced in the latest march report however due to reported weakness in q results and muted gdp growth it appears unlikely that the business could turn on a dime to produce outsized q results as the led transition gains traction and the business environment improves however orion should begin to gain market share and ramp up volume due in a large part to product innovation advantages led adoption is underway and has just begun the largest led lighting transaction to date was recently reported by current a division of general electric to outfit  jp morgan branches with led lighting fixtures the dollar value of the deal was not disclosed however it was reported as a recordsetting led lighting transaction ge does not appear to have product advantage over orion in the led retrofit fixtures space likely more significant ge has maintained a business relationship with jp morgan going back to  when the latter put together the merger deal that formed general electric it is logical that it would choose general electric instead of a lessrecognized name strategic repositioning orion announced on april th that it had entered into an agreement to sell its fully owned square feet manufacturing distribution and office property located on  acres in manitowoc wisconsin for  million in cash the company owns an additional  acres adjacent to the site with  million in cash and a strong balance sheet at the end of q it is apparent that orion is not cashstrapped and it intends to invest in rd and product development in the rapidly evolving led lighting business based on what it has done so far in new product launches with relatively small expenditures on rd and product development the decision appears to be well grounded moving away from a vertically integrated model the company is transitioning into a leaner operation with greater return on investment in order to increase shareholder value with increasing demands for advanced technology in the space it becomes apparent that new products require a higher degree of complexity in a greatly enhanced array of features demanded in the space which will require more outsourcing accordingly the company will lease back  square feet of the facility which will have the effect of rightsizing the business and lowering operating costs the strategic repositioning represents another stage in a process that has been going on for several years in shedding assets including other property and a corporate jet to become an assetlight technologyenhanced business the stock today trading near  oesx appears to be bottoming in a long descent down from a multiyear high near  january  to a low of  february   with a strong balance sheet and compelling lineup of products in the fastgrowing led business it is hard to imagine the stock going much lower it could happen but appears doubtful in any event it will likely take improving strong reported results to move the stock much higher after a long string of earnings disappointments over the past few years the company completed its fiscal q march  and is now operating in fiscal  with a multiyear turnaround in the rearview mirror and strong fundamentals it appears likely that the stock will establish an upward trend going forward conclusion the led lighting industry is changing at breakneck speed and it appears that orion energy systems is leading innovation in the led retrofit space due to a challenging turnaround situation the company has a history of muted revenue and quarterly losses as its legacy business receded with the prospect of led adoption repeated disappointments in reported revenue and earnings have driven the stock down to nearpenny stock status in the range of  per share but unlike most penny stocks orion has a real business poised for a leap forward the launch of the ldrm and ldre will take a product conceived in the s the troffer and propel it into the hightech world of today a thorough review of orion including its product suite financials management decisions business organization and client roster reveals a company worth much more than the market currently assigns it while quarterly losses have been ongoing for quite a while the company experienced a  yoy improvement for the  months end december   the author remains upbeat on the company after choosing oesx for an sa contest best pick of  and increasing long holdings in the shares the shares appear to have bottomed and to be in the early stages of an uptrend we

cash flowmanagement has delivered on a total remake of the business now visible in resultsnew products new customers new markets and new channel partners enable a potential steep trajectory of future revenue and profit growthprojected growth of led lighting and “smart” building technologies provide a tailwind for the company in a secular trend that will continue for decadesinnovation and a constant stream of new products are driving the company to become a key leader in the led lighting industryanyone familiar with the history of orion energy systems nysemktoesx has known the company to be a huge disappointment to investors since its ipo in  as the chart below illustrates i have written previous sa articles on oesx beginning in  and have been following the company since  an obvious question that can be raised is an assumption of falling in love with a stock and holding on for an extended period of underperformance most weak holders abandoned oesx as the stock was pushed down under  in a long wrenching process such a process tries the patience of investors and requires a greater and greater level of knowledge understanding and patience to remain in a stock the purpose of the current article will be to consider some of the reasons for staying with and doubling down on orion founded in  and located in manitowoc wisconsin oesx originally supplied retrofit lighting fixtures and controls which reduced energy consumption for its clients mainly industrial entities in the age before led adoption the company supplied florescent lighting fixtures and controls that offered superior performance to reduce energy consumption booking revenue to clients that included about  fortune  companies by  the company risked extinction as led adoption began which changed the industry in multiple ways with led lighting could be designed in an infinite variety of configurations instead of linearfixed configurations common in florescent which began an explosion of led product development and offerings due to its declining prospects the oesx board near the end of  made a decision to implement sweeping changes and a major restructuring of the business which included a demotion of the former ceofounder as well as other management changes the management changes ultimately resulted in the departure of the former ceo as well as extreme employee turnover throughout the ranks in addition to management changes the entire business structure was totally inept to compete in the led space at the time the company also maintained a division that fabricated structures that were supplied in solar energy installations the company had no led product lines with no inhouse research engineering or design capabilities the company had built its business largely in the industrial space with the majority of revenue focused on highbay lighting it sold its products either on a direct basis to national accounts or through contractors termed energy service companies escos in summary orion was totally unprepared for the transition to led which was beginning adoption ultimately management faced challenges of exiting the legacy businesses conceiving designing and launching new led products sourcing led raw materials and a complete reset of its marketingdistribution system the entire business had to be rebuilt to transition into led during the extended restructuring that lasted over three years multiple chargeoffs and writedowns were recorded as the legacy business was shed and facilities were repositioned for the future when beginning to supply its initial led lighting products the company was forced to source led components at unfavorable acquisition costs starting from a zero base all of the foregoing resulted is severe financial underperformance for over three years which put the stock where it is today beginning in  management set in place a strategic plan to restructure the business and transition to led in spite of the challenges discussed above the company has executed to completion several key targets against its strategic plan which are listed below  implemented its plan to transition from florescent to led lighting which resulted in led lighting revenue of  of revenue reported in q  acquired harris lighting company which was a troffer lighting supplier in office and commercial markets which expanded the market from industrial into office and retail expanding its addressable market manyfold  set up an innovation hub in chicago staffed with lightingled experts to bring designengineering inhouse and

the companys addressable market to  of the business  navigated the business to improved financial metrics with growing margin improvement and positive cash flow  positioned both the organization and assets for leaner operations and better financial performance although not yet showing up significantly in the numbers the above accomplishments give evidence that management has the ability to execute which should ultimately show up in financial performance the company and stock today some current financial metrics for orion are illustrated in the table below mktcap revttm grossmgn pricesls pricebk revqq eps yoy fcf yoy mm mm       to  mm source finvizcom and company reports as of  as illustrated above the market is currently ignoring the growth parameters and further the prospects for oesx in the highgrowth led lighting business a price to sales ratio of  depicts a business that is in a state of decline not growth gross margin is low at  however margins have continued to grow by quarter and reached  in q revenue and eps have shown significant improvement as the company turned cash flow positive which is further documented in the table below with quarterly numbers the quarterly numbers reveal a company that has shown continual improvement albeit with fits and starts the numbers show a company that has reduced risk with increased cash and dwindling longterm debt in addition to low debt oesx had a current ratio of  at the end of q maintaining a strong balance sheet q  q  q  q  q  q  revmm       grossmgn       eps       fcf mm       cash mm       ltd mm       source company reports the quarterly numbers also show that q and q revenues typically have run higher in comparison to q and q as industrial customers increase spending near the end of their budget cycles during the back half of last year  revenues came in very light due to decreased business spending confirmed by lower ism indicators at  million and  million for q and q respectively the  million was slightly exceeded in q although performance has shown some deviation by quarter it should be considered that orions business has mainly consisted of supplying capital equipment to industry which can fluctuate significantly by quarter as traction gains in commercial and retail the company will diversify its revenue stream by industry and business cycle recent economic indicators that have been reported appear to indicate that the economy is picking up steam which should be accompanied by improved business spending further led adoption has not gained large scale traction in industrial and commercial which muted revenue gains in the immediate past an acceleration of the economy coupled with increased business spending should move orion to much higher revenue lastly the company has significant product and service advantages that will enable it to meet the competition and more likely exceed it no discussion of orion would be complete without mention of its impressive customer base it has done business with over  fortune  companies with its legacy lighting products which offers a runway to the led lighting market an illustration of some of its client list is given below source company presentation while oesx stock has been in an extended downturn as noted in the longterm chart illustrated earlier the chart below shows an impressive breakout since the beginning of november and it appears the market is beginning to recognize the potential upside and excellent prospects still at  a share it has likely just begun courtesy stockchartscom from november  to november  oesx rallied an impressive  from  to  the rally paralleled a rally in the russell  rut in the same time frame however the russell recorded a gain of  from  to  the beginning outperformance of oesx could signal outperformance for an extended period as the stock moves from a very small base whether it continues depends on continued financial improvement and recognition by the market of its improving prospects rd and smart technologysmart buildings before the transition to led orion maintained a strong position as a leader in lighting and energy management controls since retooling the company to led occupied most of the resources of the company development of controls took a back seat to the led transition on the q earnings conference call ceo john scribante addressed a question concerning potential new products for smart technology  smart building controls in essence mr scribante stated that the company in most of its history since  had been a leader in building controls and energy efficiency management due to the led transition the company has recently partnered with thirdparty sources to supply smart technology components according to mr scribante the company intends to invest in smart technologies where it makes sense in the overall financial performance of the company without spending millions to compete in an already overcrowded space nearterm expectations as the recent stock price and breakout seem to indicate orion should perform well as it completes the back half of the fiscal year ending march  since q and q typically exceed first half revenue and management continued guidance of revenue increases ranging from  fiscal  should end well the back half will be further bolstered by a recent new contract award from toyota to install orion highbay fixtures at an  million square feet facility in kentucky which according to management will book  of its revenue in qq it must be further pointed out that management guided that the  gross margin achieved in q will not be likely achieved in qq and that it expects gross margin to be in the range of  due to businessproduct mix management further stated that while margins can increase to the mid range beyond qq some lumpiness in margins will likely occur as the business proceeds in a ramp up longterm expectations as led adoption continues to build momentum especially in industrial and commercial applications orion revenue and profits will likely accelerate with the company operating near breakeven earnings should show significant gains beyond the level of meeting fixed costs enabling a rampup in profits and the stock price the company has exhibited an ability to execute significant changes in the business and at the same time control costs there appears not to be a competitor operating in its specific market retrofit led lighting for industrial and commercial that offers a comparable array of fixtures and performance once revenue and profits begin ramping the stock price will likely track with a long upward trajectory beyond  the company has an enviable product lineup with product and service advantages beyond most of the competition ge nysege and flex nasdaqflex likely orions most notable competitors when it comes to bidding projects possess financial resources much larger than orion but are lacking in focus notable with orion in addition as orion gains traction it will surely gain attention from other big players in the market which could position it as an acquisition target with a current market cap near  million it may already be on the radar screen of bigger operators cree nasdaqcree which announced in july the sale of its wolfspeed division for  million in cash could be a likely suitor at the time of the announcement cree management stated publicly that it will be in the market for complimentary acquisitions as the led lighting market continues to gain traction there will be many beneficiaries like the companies previously mentioned orion stock however could be a huge beneficiary risks orion energy systems has experienced ongoing losses for multiple years which could continue the company competes in a market populated with much bigger players like ge flex phillips eaton nyseev osram otcpkosagf cree and others the company has limited resources by comparison its current lineup of product advantages could be upended by competitors with much deeper pockets to fund rd and product development lastly technological leaders in the smart building arena could develop superior lighting configurations and coupled with a strong suite of smart technologies secure an advantage conclusion orion energy systems appears to be well positioned to become a major player in the led lighting market with potential revenue and profit gains along the way in addition the company has expanded its addressable market manyfold to capture its share of led revenue which is expected to reach  billion by  growing at an annual cagr of  between  and  while it remains a tiny company in a universe of much larger players oesx has the potential for outsized gains in appreciation but with increased risk compared to large
