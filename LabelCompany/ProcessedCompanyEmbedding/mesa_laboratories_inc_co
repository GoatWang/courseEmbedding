capabilities in the food processing industry we need lethality data to know whether the product is safe to eat autoclave customers processing for sterilization will need reporting capabilities to display pass or fail criteria for their process all of this information can now be graphed and displayed all on one report with just one extra click for a quick easytoread review of the process for anyone to check the results the robust reporting capabilities of the dt pro software provide beautiful reports with graphs and calculations such as lethality pre and postcalibration verification displays of loggers before and after the process and a placement view of the data loggers this is an efficient solution for a reporting engine with no postprocessing required time and energy spent postprocessing data in excel or other calculation software can be put elsewhere while the dt pro software does that work for you in software pre and post calibration verification there is a requirement to perform as found results before use in eo because once the gasses have affected the sensor you need to prove that it was in calibration the next time it is used right before use being able to do pre and postcalibration on your own saves a lot of time and hassle the software offers a “set it and forget it” type of calibration with industry standard controls and the ability to assess to a certain specified tolerance it can calibrate loggers directly in the software and communicate with industry standard or leading metrology equipment this saves time and energy while giving you the control over the calibration to determine which data points are being checked and verified your loggers will be kept within tolerance while removing hassle from the equation please note it is still recommended that you receive factory calibration once per year but performing it in house simplifies the process cfr part  compliance when it comes to cfr part  compliance if you are not compliant you cannot use the data loggers and software so it is imperative to know what regulations you need to meet and whether your software is compliant cfr part  compliance is great for pharmaceutical

reporting software dt pro contact your sales rep or click here to learn more inside data loggers data loggers overview a data logger is an electronic device used to record data over time in a particular position or placement data loggers are designed to measure a wide variety of conditions and processes and selecting a proper data logger for a particular process can become somewhat challenging as data loggers have evolved over time their design has become much more specialized and their construction much more robust and customized programmable data loggers can be used to gain a lot of information about a process the user dictates the intervals in which a reading is logged and as is the case with datatrace can even dictate how and when the logger communicates it data to the serversoftware used in conjunction with its powerful reporting software datatrace pro dt pro datatrace data loggers can be extremely useful for identifying cold spots establishing sterility assurance or validating new equipment or processes data logger placement in order to record the most accurate data placement of data loggers is of the utmost importance the closer a data logger can be positioned to the actual productitems being monitored the more accurate the data is and the more information you have about the product itself as it is processed because of this datatrace mpiii and mprf data loggers have been designed so that they can retrieve data from within a container or within the product itself temperature data loggers many data loggers are designed to measure temperature some measure ambient temperature as in a room or warehouse while others are intended to measure temperature in processes that are much more extreme such as a lyophilization process or inside an autoclave processes even reaching higher in temperatures such as depyrogenation are monitoring with data loggers but not every data logger can monitor any process datatrace data loggers are engineered specifically for extreme environments such as steam ethylene oxide and other various sterilization processes and chambers heat tunnels retorts smokehouses food processing and more autoclavessteam sterilization retort sterilization dry heat ovens and tunnels curing processes food pasteurization and several other processes rely on accurate temperature measurements to ensure productpatient safety product integrity and process reliability though critical to many applications temperature data logging is not the only crucial parameter that datatrace data loggers can be useful for humidity data loggers humidity data loggers must be able to accurately record rh across the full humidity spectrum accuracy for humidity data logging is often of prime importance as humidity can alter or negatively impact product it can be detrimental to equipment or materials and can drastically alter the effectiveness of other processes in ethylene oxide sterilization processes for instance there are a number of factors to monitor certainly levels of eo are important as well as the temperature inside of the process or vessel central to the effective delivery of an ethylene oxide insult humidity must be monitored closely to ensure that the sterilization process is successful typical eo sterilization processes require humidity levels to be near  while humidity levels near  may be low enough to cause process failure pressure data loggers recording the pressure data from a canning pouch or other food process is vital to ensure the safety of the items and the efficacy of the process pressure data loggers must be rugged to withstand the environment while also accurate enough to detect the smallest variances when monitoring food processing supply lines and other various industrial applications a complete data logging system consists not only of high quality data loggers but also incorporates software to collect read graph and report on the data after or in the case of datatrace rf during the
