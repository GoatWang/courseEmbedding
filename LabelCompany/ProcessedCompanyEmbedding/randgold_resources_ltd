the next chinamay  about randgold resources gold gathon capital longshort equity special situations deep value valuesummaryrandgold is urge in searching for the next growth engine as the company has hit a concrete wall in terms of revenue growth over the past couple yearsthe problem with africa viewed by randgold ceo as the next china is that its per capita income today is still too lowthe answer for randgolds quest for growth today is still china because for now the major consumption power of the emerging markets still lies in china not africalast fall randgold resources nasdaq gold ceo mark bristow expressed an extremely bullish view on africa and named it next china he planned to set up new operations in africa and use it to fuel the companys sales in general we agree with mr bristows assessment about africas bright future and the continents aboveaverage growth rate during the coming years randgolds urge in searching for the next growth engine is understandable as the company like most other big gold companies in the world has hit a concrete wall in terms of revenue growth over the past couple years the following table shows randgolds revenues for the last three years randgold is not alone most other major gold companies in the world are in similar or worse situation the following table shows the compound annual revenue growth rates over the past two years for four major gold companies in the world  randgold resources goldcorp inc nysegg barrick gold corporation nyseabx and anglogold ashanti ltd nyseau so is africa the answer to randgolds quest for the new source of growth in our opinion it might be in the future but we think the answer today is still china not the next china our judgment is based on a clear and simple logic for now and at least the following decade the major consumption power of the emerging markets still lies in china not africa the major challenge for randgold today is to find additional demand for its product in order to increase the quantity sold to achieve this goal randgold needs to find a new market and group of customers that have high purchase power and lust for gold products in addition it is a good idea for randgold to vertically expand into the downstream business  the wholesaling and retailing business of gold jewelries  in order to increase its gross and net margins it is the best for randgold to sell its branded gold products in a new market in which the consumers adore major international companies and are eager to accumulate products made by those companies for the next ten to twenty years that market is still china thats why most major fashion brands of the world  gucci armani lv coach nine west etc  have established big footprint in china and have reaped hefty profits from china over the last couple decades the problem with africa is that its per capita income today is still too low gold is a luxury good most people want to own it only after they are above certain wealth level at which all their basic life demands have been met and have enough spared money to improve their images and preserve their wealth against inflation according to wikipedia imfs data show that in  percapita gdp of china stood at  usd while per capita gdp of south africa the wealthiest country of africa was only  meanwhile chinas population is about  times of south africas other african countries percapita gdps are even lower averaging to about only a quarter of chinas percapita gdp the following table shows china and african countries percapita gdps in  three months ago an article with an eyecatching title it might be impossible to keep up with chinas demand for gold was published on markets insider news portal it was written by one of the most esteemed gold specialist byron king byron a harvard graduate has traveled to every us state and territory and six of the seven continents and has deep knowledge in the gold market in china he has been interviewed by dozens of major print and broadcast media outlets including the financial times the guardian the washington post msn money marketwatch fox business news and pbs newshour when such a senior gold specialist said that chinas demand for gold is ballooning in an insatiate way investors and people in the gold industry had better listen byrons view was reckoned by china gold associations last report published just a couple weeks ago according to the association in the first quarter of  in china gold consumption rose  percent while gold supply dropped  as a result china has to import thousands of tons of gold from oversea each year and the prices of gold products keeps on rising fast every year in china in addition to consumers demand industrial demand for gold in china has been growing fast too in an article published on seeking alpha in late  the author said electronic usage accounts for  million tons of gold usage annually and that quantum will increase as the likes of china upgrade their telecom infrastructure under this backdrop it is no wonder that many wholesalers and retailers of gold product in china such as central gold shanghai stock exchange  hunan gold shenzhen stock exchange  chifeng gold shenzhen stock exchange  and kingold jewelry nasdaq kgji saw splendid revenue growth over the past two year see the following table for details the average twoyear revenue growth rate of the group makes that of the worlds major gold companies shown earlier look embarrassing unlike major clothing and apparel companies major gold companies in the world have mostly ignored chinese market in the past we are not sure the reason but we think that was a big mistake a company like randgold which has rich experience operating in different countries and cultures should give china a hard look right now and take firstmover advantage before its competitors start moving into china if the company is not comfortable going into china on itsown spending several hundred millions to buy an established existing player in china such as kingold jewelry may be a good alternative that randgold might want to consider the way we look at it one way or another the industry probably will experience some major integrations over the next couple years during which some small undervalued companies and some big heavyweight companies may appreciate significantly as the average sales volume and profit margin of the industry rise materially as global demand rises fast and global supply stays constrained thus aggressive and risktolerant investors may want to consider going overweight on gold companies today and placing some extra chips on those companies selling gold in china now or probably in the near future disclosure i amwe are long kgji i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not
