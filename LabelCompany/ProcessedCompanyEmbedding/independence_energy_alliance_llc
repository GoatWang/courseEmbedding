that was established in  in philadelphia pennsylvania the company offers electric power supply through natural gas services and energy plus holdings llc energy plus provides its services in maryland new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and much more energy plus provides different options to consumers which search for nonpolluting variants which reduce influence of traditional energy sources the company also offers its customers special discounts on a number of products energy plus is licensed by a number of authorities throughout several states of the country including the public utility commission of texas the pennsylvania public utility commission the new york public service commission and the new jersey board of public utilities  independence energy alliance is a subsidiary of energy plus it costs  for their website plus a  monthly service charge an associate emphasis is on encouraging others to become asssociates while inviting consumers to make the switch to green energy for free they offer consumers an opportunity to save money on their energy bill a  annual rebate representing a percentage of that calender years energy bill surge protection unemployment insurance and payment of that months energy bill if service is interrupted associates earn commissions on all active consumer accounts plus bonuses and residuals they also promote the best compensation package in the mlm business however theirs is identical to linx i was brought in by linda doucette whos father paid for my website on the condition that i bring a certain number of customers in a specific period of time i told linda i was skeptical for one reason the free termination option did not protect me from a higher electric bill nothing prevented my energy bill from increasing then i can terminate but i still owe for a higher bill she stated no that would be fraud  so i agreed to join in i even attended their october   seminar in hoboken i remember the date because its the same day i passed the drivers test and got my drivers license i switched my energy just to be sure i was not going to sell or promote a fruadulent contract i approached churches business organizations pba pta etc and apartment complex building managers the goal is toget associates under you who bring accounts hence it made sense to attract people in positions of trust who had acces to more than hundreds of people at once i served  years in orison and its hard to find gainful employment becoming an iea associate sounded like an attractive deal i could run my business via email and be a stay at home dad and care for my son my first energy bill was more than  higher the iea energy rate was higher than my usual jcpl rate i called jcpl and told them to terminate the green energy supplier then i called iea and told them i no longer wanted to be an associate the woman explained to me they iea does not promote a lesser energy bill  i went to my website and read to them the information they gave me to promote nothing with the information they provide informs the consumer they must pay the service charge they only stated that green energy will by provided through your current energy provider generally jcpl charges a  servicedelivery fee she stated thats why we give  cash back to cover the service charge the service charge is  a year plus what i owe to iea for the green energy no matter how theytry to explain it away the energy bill increases by the service charge and the higher iea energy rate she even had the audacity to tell me your bill was only  higher this month  now termination is free but it takes a month my second energy bill was more than  higher  after termination  mlm business train you to start with the warm market  family and friends i would not have agreed to switch but that linda doucette told me it would be a crime for this to occur im an exoffendrr and do not have a steady reliable income i just had a son it made sense to lower already surmouting bills my mother in law trusted me after i told her what i was told she knew why i didnt want to do it in the first place i told all the organizations and people i contacted that i will do my energy bill first and let them see the savings themselves my first associate would have been a manager of a  unit apartment building a seniors complex people who love to brag about how frugal they are  and its nothing but a scam i told iea they are not getting paid the law cannot be expected to enforce a deceptive contract you cannot deceive people about whats really entailed and seek to bail yourself out with fine print fineprint only means you knew i was going to find out how you robbed me and nothing else i have emailed linda doucette  who hasnt contacted me since i told her about my higher electric bill she lied to me i didnt lose anything as her dad paid for the site but if this was not a scam it would have been a good source of income   this report was posted on

record straight rebuttals  replies author consumer employeeowner updates  rebuttals  consumer comment who is the ripoff author dave  united states of america submitted saturday november   posted saturday november   it sounds like the real ripoff was the base company for your area jcpl with deregulation and open competition it sound like their strategy is to apply this rediculus service fee to discourage cutomers from leaving that is not going to last long before the government steps in and tells them to stop that practice if they dont get sued first independence alliance or any other competitive company cannot control what the current electric company a consumer is with charges for servicing outside electric providers this type of action shuts down the whole intent of deregulation rather than be the pawn of jcpl and put something like this out there you would have been better served filing a complaint with some kind of consumer protection agency to stop this practice by jcpl respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update employee consumer misunderstanding between energy supply and energy deliver author ieacommunications  united states of america submitted monday march   posted monday march   this post is the result of a misunderstanding by the consumer on the difference between energy supply and energy delivery  independence energy tried to work with this consumer to educate him on his areas of concern when a customer decides to switch from the utility to a retail energy supplier the supplier of the energy will change however the delivery method will remain the same  in this instance although the customers source of energy switched to independence energy the delivery was still through the local utility jcpl as this relates to billing retail energy suppliers like independence energy  only charge for the supply of the energy not the delivery  interestingly at the time of the above post independence energys rate per kilowatt hour was  versus jcpls price to compare of   independence energy does not however propose to always offer the lowest rate at all times  the independence energy rate is variable and therefore subject to change  we do aspire to price lower than the utility but this is not a guaranteethis fact is explained to the customer at the time of their energy provider switch and is also included in the contractual agreement the only way to compare the cost of energy is to look at the rate per kilowatt hour  to only look at the bill from one month to the next is quite deceiving as the electricity usage will vary one cannot simply have a lowerhigher bill from one month to the next and assume that they are paying lessmore for their energy  this is especially true for the author of this post  in looking at this customers electric usage both before and during his time with independence energy it is apparent that his varied greatly     the  delivery charge that the author of this post is concerned with was not a charge from independence energy  furthermore his switch to an independent energy source in no way brought about this  delivery charge  this charge came from his local utility jcpl and would have been charged regardless of the customer exercising their choice to go with a retail energy supplier   we do as addressed in this post offer  and  cash back on electric usage every year to our customers  this is not to cover any kind of charge on the consumers end and the author of this post was never told that by marketing materials or employees of independence energy  this is simply an added benefit that we like to give our customers for choosing independence energy as their energy source  our customers receive  cash back when they choose our green plus product with  renewable energy exceeding state minimum renewable requirements and  cash back when they go completely green with our true green  renewable product  additional benefits that we offer our customers are unemployment protection and free surge protection  a power surge is a sudden increase in power and can occur at any moment for a number of reasons a power surge can severely damage home appliances and electronics we guarantee up to  in surge protection for all products that might be damaged in a power surge independence energy customers are protected in the event of involuntary job loss independence energys unemployment protection provides payment of all independence energy charges on the energy bill up to  per month for up to three months at independence energy we find that our customers are very happy and generally do not experience these kinds of situations  we apologize for any misunderstanding that this customer experienced  we pride ourselves on being an honest open and ethical company  there are no hidden fees independence energy is proud to offer consumers in nj pa ny il ct and tx the power to choose affordable renewable energy options to fit their financial and environmental needs we encourage anyone

information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  general comment questions regarding this complaint author jdomp  united states of america submitted sunday january   posted sunday january   my name is joe p and i am very interested in joining independence energy alliance  i read your article and have some questions of my own before i venture down this road  who charged the  fee you mentioned  and if charged by your local utility wouldnt that be illegal on their part  was the rate ie was charging less than the rate your local provider was charging  were you maybe on a budget plan with your local provider so your monthly bill was steady all year and through ie you were on a normal usage plan so other months could have been much cheaper  would you be willing to email me a copy of your  bills and  previous so i could make a compairson i have been to  meetings  numerous conference calls and read the entire rulesregulations booklet  i even took it to a lawyer to double check the legality  the company seems legit  the payplan is great and obviously the product sells itself  however if customers arent saving money or at least paying the same price with the added benefits i would agree with your article  thats why id like to do a little research if this is just an isolated event or if something else went into the bill discrepancy
