investment philosophy the muzinich story investment philosophy and process philosophy we view buying a bond as lending money to a company we look for bonds for which the market is mispricing risk based on our rigorous bottomup credit research we constantly assess relative value and dynamically adjust portfolios as riskreturn profiles change our goal is to compound attractive interest streams while avoiding defaults and credit impairments this approach may sound simple but in our experience is not commonly adopted many investors do not view buying a bond as lending money to a company but see it as buying a security for a short period of time in order to benefit from hoped for market appreciation we call this “speculative lending”   process our process is designed around our value lending philosophy and is based on  principles build a deep understanding of the business model of the companies we lend to evaluate products competitors suppliers and customers conduct proprietary quantitative analysis and stress test our investment assumptions for difficult environments carefully review credit contracts and covenants evaluate company management construct highly liquid

requests that ticc board postpone special meeting of stockholders and engage muzinich  co inc requests that ticc board postpone special meeting of stockholders and engage independent advisors to run comprehensive evaluation sep    et from muzinich  co inc new york sept   prnewswire  muzinich  co inc a top  stockholder of ticc capital corp nasdaq ticc announced today that it has delivered a letter to the board of ticc requesting that the board immediately postpone the special meeting of stockholders currently scheduled for october 7  and that a reputable investment bank be engaged to undertake a comprehensive review of existing competing offers solicit additional offers and recommend action that is in the best interests of stockholders the full text of the letter follows board of directors ticc capital corp dear sirs we write with reference to recent events concerning ticc capital corp ticc we wish to notify you that muzinich  co inc we or muzinich an institutional investment manager acting on behalf of its clients holds a material position in ticc as of june   we were among the top  stockholders of ticc and have been a stockholder for over one year muzinich strongly believes that ticcs board of directors must establish a comprehensive process to identify and independently evaluate existing competing offers solicit additional offers and recommend action that is in the best interests of stockholders in discussions with your management we mentioned that perhaps the board of directors should postpone the special meeting of stockholders of ticc scheduled for october 7  and hire an investment banking firm to review existing offers as well as solicit additional offers this course of action we believe would assure that the best interests of stockholders are being served we were surprised when the special committee released a statement on september   reaffirming its initial position and we believe premature decision to pursue the benefit street partners benefit street offer over competing offers we believe based on public disclosure this decision was made without the benefit of appropriate advice and necessary deliberation especially as the benefit street offer does not expire we were further disappointed by the letter from the special committee to stockholders of september   again rejecting a competing offer without due consideration or process we would like to note that the board of directors has continued to extend the management contract of the current investment manager of ticc ticc management llc who has pursued an investment strategy which has not proven to be in the best interests of stockholders as you know ticcs share price has declined over  since its ipo and has declined during the past twelve months by approximately  this poor share price performance has directly resulted from the continued pursuit of the current non market investment strategy and will likely make any portfolio rebalancing by a new investment manager more complex given this continued failure of process since the ipo we would expect the board of directors to make every effort to ensure that any change of investment manager would be clearly in the best interests of stockholders and demonstrate good faith in this pursuit through a thorough thoughtful and comprehensive process again we are requesting that the board of directors of ticc immediately postpone the special meeting of stockholders of ticc scheduled for october 7  and hire an investment banking firm to review in good faith all existing offers and importantly solicit additional offers to assure that the best interests of stockholders are being served sincerely yours muzinich  co inc  park avenue new york n y  about muzinich  co inc muzinich is a global institutional asset manager with bn aum
