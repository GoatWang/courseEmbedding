investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component sectors and current positioning metals position

strategy of the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund includes a quantitative strategic indexbased approach to commodity investing exposure to  commodities that can individually be long or flat if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash the ability to make position changes intramonth based on trends monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels a “smart” contract roll approach  smart contract roll approach – a futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract why invest in the fund the longflat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable longonly commodity indices has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component sectors and current positioning metals position
