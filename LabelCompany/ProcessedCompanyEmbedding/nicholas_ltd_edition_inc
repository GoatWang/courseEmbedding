in  our philosophy is based on a fundamental bottomup approach to security selection with a longterm investment horizon  our process focuses on identifying securities offering secular growth characteristics strong financial bases reasonable valuations and downside risk our longterm approach deemphasizes the shortterm impact of daytoday market volatility and maintains a focus on the longterm potential of the securities in our portfolios providing a more consistent return with reduced volatility encourages investors to maintain market exposure and stay invested for the long run
