unaudited interim condensed financial statements we have prepared our unaudited interim condensed financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the

the unaudited interim condensed financial statements contain all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly in all material respects our financial position as of june   the interim results of operations for the three and six months ended june   and  and cash flows for the six months ended june   and  these interim statements have not been audited the

read in conjunction with our audited financial statements including the notes thereto for the year ended december   the unaudited condensed financial position results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods disclosed in this report are not necessarily indicative of future financial results   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates          westmountain distressed debt inc

managing private equity and direct investment funds for third parties including high net worth individuals and institutions as is the industry practice we plan to earn management fees based on the size of the funds that we manage and incentive income based on the performance of these funds we do not plan to focus on any particular industry but will look at any and all opportunities we are presently planning to develop and implement a web site based operation to gather additional potential investment opportunities beyond what we can generate through our network of contacts we also plan to utilize the most current technology to analyze investments we believe the technology will assist in the analysis of each opportunity our principal executive offices are located at a e harmony road  fort collins colorado  and our telephone number is    however in the future we plan to occupy separate office facilities and obtain office furniture and equipment depending on the development of our business plan if we are not successful in our operations we will be faced with several options            cease operations and go out of business    continue to seek alternative and acceptable sources of capital    bring in additional capital that may result in a change of control or    identify a candidate for acquisition that seeks access to the public marketplace and its financing sources we have not been subject to any bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding          results of operations   the following discussion involves our results of operations for the three and six months ended june   and june   we have not generated operating revenues since our inception   operating expenses consist primarily of selling general and administrative costs most of the costs were attributable to professional and contract services for the three months ended june   and june   operating expenses were  and  respectively for the six months ended june   and june   operating expenses were  and  respectively in  the company paid additional professional fees to become dtc eligible for the same period of time the company paid additional audit fees  we do not anticipate these professional fees or contract services to increase significantly in the future however we believe that our selling general and administrative costs will increase as we grow our business activities going forward for the three months ended june   and  we had a net loss of  and  respectively net loss for the six months ended june   was  compared to a net loss of  for the six months ended june   the decrease in net loss over the periods presented are directly related to the change in operating expenses liquidity and capital resources our cash on june   was    cash flows used in operating activities were  for the six months ended june   compared to cash flows used in operating activities of  for the six months ended june   the change over the periods presented are related to the decrease in net loss an increase in accounts payable and accrued interest on the related party notes payable net cash used in investing activities was  for the six months ended june   and june     cash flows provided by financing activities were  and  for the six months ended june   and june   the change over the periods presented are related to proceeds that the company received from related parties for the six months ended june   in  no proceeds have been received for the six months ended june    over the next twelve months we do not expect any material capital costs in our operations because most of our costs are fixed in amount and are recurring in nature we expect our quarterly operating expenses to remain consistent throughout    we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues we expect approximately  to  in operating costs for the current year we plan to generate revenues in the next twelve months from making investments and receiving fees for the placement of capital since there can be no assurances that we will generate any revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future it will be necessary to raise additional funds we believe at this time that raising additional funds may be difficult if not impossible we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of business          on october   we entered into a promissory note agreement with westmountain company a related party in the amount of  the note bears an interest rate of

for january   to december   we plan to act as a holder of distressed real estate properties by raising investing and managing private equity and direct investment funds for third parties including high net worth individuals and institutions as is the industry practice we earn management fees based on the size of the funds that we manage and incentive income based on the performance of these funds we do not focus on any particular industry in the real estate market but will look at any and all opportunities we are presently planning to develop and implement a web site based operation to gather additional potential investment opportunities beyond what we can generate through our network of contacts we also plan to utilize the most current technology to analyze investments we believe the technology will assist in the analysis of each opportunity                additionally we have decided to pursue finding an acquisition candidate as either an alternative or an adjunct to our present business plan to date we have had discussions with potential candidates but have not concluded any definitive arrangements and may never do so however for the remainder of the fiscal year we plan to both actively pursue our business plan and to look for an acquisition candidate if we are not successful in our business plan or in finding an acquisition candidate we will be faced with several options       cease operations and go out of business       continue to seek alternative and acceptable sources of capital or       bring in additional capital that may result in a change of control or       identify a candidate for acquisition that seeks access to the public marketplace and its financing sources we operate out of one office in colorado we have no specific plans at this point for additional offices     offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements with any party item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk none          item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures     as of the end of the period covered by this report based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a e and de under the exchange act our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting this report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting part ii  other information item   legal proceedings there are no legal proceedings to which we are a party which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results item a  risk factors   you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all of the other information included in this document any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results and could negatively impact the value of your investment   the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely   affect our business financial condition and operating result in this case   the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or   part of your investment   we are in default on all of our debt and have an outstanding payable to the otc market at the present time we are in default on all of our debt which is in the amount of  as of june   in addition we have a payable outstanding in the amount of  to the otc market for continued listing of our common stock we are actively negotiating an extension of our debt and searching for additional funding to continue our operations and to liquidate if we are unable to renegotiate our debt and ultimately pay off our debt and payables we may be forced to cease operations if we are unable to pay for our continued listing on the otc market we may lose our stock listing at the present time we cannot guarantee that we will either be able to renegotiate our debt or pay any of our payables including the payable for our continued otc market listing we have no substantial operating history and have never been profitable  as a result we may never become profitable and as a result we could go out of business we were formed as a colorado business entity in october   at the present time we have never been profitable there can be no guarantee that we will ever be profitable  even if we develop revenue there is no assurance that we will become a profitable company we may never become profitable and as a result we could go out of business because we had incurred a loss and have limited operations our accountants have expressed doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern for our audit as of december   our accountants have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of a limited history of operations limited assets and operating losses since inception our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon   ·   our ability to find suitable investments and ·   our ability to generate substantial revenues based upon current plans we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues  we expect approximately  to  in operating costs over the next twelve months we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs failure to generate sufficient revenues will cause us to go out of business      our lack of substantial operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance an investor could lose his entire investment   we have a limited operating history an investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects this makes it difficult if not impossible to evaluate us as an investment an investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in our ever becoming profitable if we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our operations our business may fail we have not generated revenues since our inception as of june   we had a cash position of  we are in default on all of our debt which is in the amount of  as of june   in addition we have a payable outstanding in the amount of  to the otc market for continued listing of our common stock we anticipate that operating costs will be approximately  for the fiscal year ending december   these operating costs include insurance taxes office lease maintenance contract services and all other costs of operations we will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated however the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict we plan to generate revenues in the next twelve months from making investments and receiving fees for the placement of capital since there can be no assurances that we will generate any revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future it will be necessary to raise additional funds we believe at this time that raising additional funds may be difficult if not impossible competition in the investment industry is intense   our business plan involves acting as an acquirer of real estate assets that are being sold at a discount to the original purchase price this business is highly competitive there are numerous similar companies providing such services in the united states of america our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully market our services in this highly competitive environment we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully the share control position of westmountain red llc will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate actions                  our largest shareholder westmountain red llc  of which mr klemsz is a  member owns  shares and thereby controls approximately  of our outstanding shares because westmountain red llc individually beneficially controls more than a majority of the outstanding shares other shareholders individually or as a group will be limited in their ability to effectively influence the election or removal of our directors the supervision and management of our business or a change in control of or sale of our company even if they believed such changes were in the best interest of our shareholders generally   our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our president and our treasurer and the continued financing of westmountain red llc   we depend almost entirely on the efforts and continued employment of mr klemsz our president and treasurer mr klemsz is our primary executive officer and we will depend on him for nearly all aspects of our operations in addition westmountain red llc is our only source of financing we do not have an employment contract with mr klemsz and we do not carry key person insurance on his life the loss of the services of mr klemsz through incapacity or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our business it would be very difficult to find and retain qualified personnel such as mr klemsz and a financing source to replace westmountain red llc our revenue and profitability fluctuate particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in our business which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our shares we may experience significant variations in revenues and profitability during the year and among years if we are paid incentive income from certain funds only when investments are realized rather than periodically on the basis of increases in the funds net asset values the timing and receipt of incentive income generated by our funds is event driven and thus highly variable which contributes to the volatility of our revenue and our ability to realize incentive income from our funds may be limited we cannot predict when or if any realization of investments will occur if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter it may have a significant impact on our revenues and profits for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters in addition our investments would be adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter resulting in revenue attributable to our principal investments even though we receive no cash distributions from our funds which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings           difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our funds and reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital which could materially reduce our revenue and results of operations if economic conditions are unfavorable our funds may not perform well and we may not be able to raise money in existing or new funds our funds are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world the global market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control including rising interest rates or inflation terrorism or political uncertainty in the event of a market downturn our businesses could be affected in different ways our funds may face reduced opportunities to sell and realize value from their existing investments and a lack of suitable investments for the funds to make in addition adverse market or economic conditions as well as a slowdown of activities in a particular sector in which portfolio companies of these funds operate could have an adverse effect on the earnings of those portfolio companies and therefore our earnings a general market downturn or a specific market dislocation may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing   § the net asset value of the assets under management to decrease lowering management fees § lower investment returns reducing incentive income § material reductions in the value of our fund investments in portfolio companies which reduce our surplus and therefore our ability to realize incentive income from these investments and § investor redemptions resulting in lower fees   furthermore while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain distressed asset investments such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds with debt investments   the success of our business depends in large part upon the proper selection of investments which may be difficult to find acquire and develop   we believe that the identification acquisition and development of appropriate investments are key drivers of our business our success depends in part on our ability to obtain these investments under favorable terms and conditions and have them increase in value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our attempts to find acquire andor develop appropriate investments will not be challenged by competitors which may put us at a disadvantage further we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior programs or investments which may imperil our profitability   risks related to an investment in our common stock   the lack of a broker or dealer to create or maintain a market in our stock could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities   we have no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for our securities and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any market makers thus no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock the lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities as well as your ability to dispose of or to obtain accurate information about andor quotations as to the price of our securities we have limited experience as a public company we have only operated as a public company since december  we have been listed to trade under the trading symbol wmds since january  thus we have limited experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us          we may be required to register under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act which could increase the regulatory burden on us and could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities   because our business involves the acquisition of real estate assets that are being sold at a discount to the original purchase price we may be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act and analogous state law while we believe that we are currently either not an investment company or an investment advisor or are exempt from registration as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act and analogous state law either the sec or state regulators or both may disagree and could require registration either immediately or at some point in the future as a result there could be an increased regulatory burden on us which could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities we may be impacted by new regulatory requirements as a result of the passage of the doddfrank act in july  congress enacted the doddfrank act which instituted major changes in the regulatory regime for public companies particularly those in the financial sector at the present time we do not believe that we will be impacted in a material way by this legislation however the implementation of the provisions of the doddfrank act are subject to regulations which have not yet been written and its statutory provisions have not been the subject of extensive judicial review so we cannot guarantee that we may not come under its purview at some point in the future and be affected negatively by it   our stock has a limited public trading market and there is no guarantee an active trading market will ever develop for our securities   there has been and continues to be a limited public market for our common stock an active trading market for our shares has not and may never develop or be sustained if you purchase shares of common stock you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial price you paid the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including the following · changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates · changes in market valuations of other companies particularly those that market services such as ours · announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations  acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments · introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for the products our projects may develop · departures of key personnel   of our total outstanding shares as of june   a total of  or approximately  is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly even if our business is doing well          as restrictions on the resale end the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them applicable sec rules governing the trading of penny stocks limit the liquidity of our common stock which may affect the trading price of our common stock   our common stock currently trades from time to time and always below  per share as a result our common stock is considered a penny stock and is subject to sec rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded  these regulations require the delivery prior to any transaction involving a penny stock of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks  under these regulations certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchasers agreement to a transaction prior to purchase  these regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock        the overthecounter market for stock such as ours is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations   the securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods these broad market fluctuations and other factors such as new product developments and trends in the our industry and in the investment markets generally as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock buying lowpriced penny stocks is very risky and speculative our common shares are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  exclusive of principal residence or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a brokerdealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale in addition the brokerdealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets   issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock if a public trading market develops   we have the authority to issue up to  shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval although no financing is planned currently we may need to raise additional capital to fund operating losses if we raise funds by issuing equity securities our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution in addition we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval   the issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock an issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could upon conversion or otherwise have all of the rights of our common stock our board of directors authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve colorado law and our articles of incorporation protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit   colorado law provides that our director will not be liable to our company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as a director our articles of incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law the exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our director caused by his negligence poor judgment or other circumstances the indemnification provisions may require our company to use our assets to defend our director and officers against claims including claims arising out of their negligence poor judgment or other circumstances    we do not expect to pay dividends on common stock we have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future earnings if any that we may realize will be

quarter ended september   compared to  for the quarter ended september    selling general and administrative costs were  for the nine months ended september   compared to  for the nine months ended september    most of the costs were attributable to professional and contract services we do not anticipate these professional fees to be as significant until we begin to grow the business

months we do not expect to incur any material capital costs in our operations   because we do not pay salaries and our major professional fees have been paid for the year operating expenses are expected to remain fairly constant   to try to operate at a breakeven level based upon our current level of business activity we believe that we must generate approximately  in revenue per year however if our forecasts are inaccurate we will need to raise additional funds in the event that we need additional capital westmountain red llc has orally agreed to loan such funds as may be necessary through december   for working capital purposes   on the other hand we may choose to scale back our operations to operate at breakeven with a smaller level of business activity while adjusting our overhead to meet the revenue from current operations in addition we expect that we will need to raise additional funds if we decide to pursue more rapid expansion the development of new or enhanced services or products appropriate responses to competitive pressures or the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies or if we must respond to unanticipated events that require us to make additional investments we cannot assure that additional financing will be available when needed on favorable terms or at all   we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues we expect approximately  in operating costs over the next twelve months we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of
