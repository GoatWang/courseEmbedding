findings show the nephrocheck test could help clinicians identify risk of acute kidney injury aki in patients with a sudden worsening of heart failure symptoms a condition known as acute decompensated heart failure adhf the study published in clinical cardiology is the first to investigate the risk assessment capabilities of timp and igfbp the urinary biomarkers measured by the test in emergency department ed patients with adhf the study urinary timp x igfbp for risk prediction of acute kidney injury in decompensated heart failure conducted at robert bosch hospital in stuttgart germany enrolled patients during initial workup in the ed the investigators found that timp x igfbp measurements identified adhf patients at risk of developing moderate to severe stage  aki for samples collected within  hours of enrollment the authors also reported an area under the curve auc an estimate of test accuracy of   ci  a sensitivity of  at a  cutoff and specificity of  at the  cutoff for prediction of aki stage – the nephrocheck test system is intended to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation in patients who currently have or have had within the past  hours acute cardiovascular and or respiratory compromise and are intensive care unit icu patients as an aid in the risk assessment for moderate or severe aki within  hours of patient assessment the nephrocheck test system is intended to be used in patients  years of age or older ortho clinical diagnostics announces expansion of global agreement with astute medical for nephrocheck test mar   ortho clinical

acute kidney injury aki a common and dangerous complication astute medical inc highlights study of nephrocheck test biomarkers in patients with sepsis oct   astute medical inc highlighted an oral presentation to be delivered at the chest annual meeting in montreal on october   at  pm eastern the presentation describes a study of two urinary cell cycle arrest biomarkers timp and igfbp that were used to assess patients with sepsis for risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury aki a precursor to kidney failure astutes test was used in the study sepsis is the most common condition associated with acute kidney failure in the intensive care unit and the combination is deadly aki has been shown to nearly double the mortality rate in sepsis cases the abstract urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase and insulinlike growth factorbinding protein  timpxigfbp accurately risk stratify acute kidney injury in patients with sepsis will be presented by dr h bryant nguyen md ms vicechair for research department of medicine loma linda university school of medicine the nephrocheck® test is designed to detect the two urinary biomarkers featured in the presentation timp and igfbp both biomarkers are involved in a wide array of responses to tissue insult inflammation oxidative stress ultraviolet radiation drugs and toxins and are thought to be involved in g cellcycle arrest during the earliest phases of injury to the kidney with results in just  minutes the nephrocheck® test helps healthcare professionals evaluate intensive care patients risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury in the next  hours the test was created for use alongside clinical evaluation of intensive care patients over  who have or have had acute cardiovascular andor respiratory compromise in the past  hours once atrisk patients have been identified and their risk stratified healthcare professionals can implement kidneysparing strategies to potentially temper the severe
