fee  distribution andor service b fees none other expenses   total annual fund operating expenses  fee waiver andor expenses reimbursement   total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver andor expense reimbursement   expenses are based on estimated amounts for the fund s current fiscal year  the advisor contractually has agreed to waive its management fee andor reimburse certain fund operating expenses but only to the extent necessary so that the fund s total operating expenses excluding brokerage fees and commissions any b fees borrowing costs such as interest and dividend expenses on securities sold short taxes extraordinary expenses and any indirect expenses such as acquired funds fees and expenses do not exceed  of the fund s average daily net assets the contractual agreement is in place through december  each waiver or reimbursement by the advisor is subject to repayment by the fund within the three  fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the particular expense was incurred provided that the current year s expense ratio is less than the prior year contractual expense cap that was in place when such prior year expenses were waived the management

outstanding voting securities of the fund or by management the management services agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its assignment the expense limitation agreement may only be terminated by the board of trustees on sixty  days written notice to management or upon the termination of the management services agreement between the trust and advisor example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the archer dividend growth fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the fund s operating expenses remain the same although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be   year  years   portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the fund s performance because the fund is new it does not yet have portfolio turnover to report principal investment strategies of the fund under normal market conditions the fund seeks to achieve its objective to provide income and as a secondary focus longterm capital appreciation by investing at least  of its net assets in equity securities of largecapitalization companies primarily in dividendpaying equity securities consisting of common stocks preferred stocks and shares of beneficial interest of real estate investment trusts reits these companies have market capitalizations in the range  million and up the market capitalization range and composition of the companies in the fund are subject to change the fund invests primarily in common stocks of companies that the investment manager believes have the potential to pay aboveaverage stable dividend and longterm aboveaverage earnings growth the fund may from time to time emphasize one or more economic sectors in selecting its investments including the consumer discretionary health care and information technology and technologyrelated sectors the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in foreign securities the fund may invest directly in foreign securities or indirectly through depositary receipts the fund may continue to own a security as long as the dividend or interest yields satisfy the funds objectives and the adviser believes the valuation is attractive and industry trends remain favorable once the advisor believes a security does not meet the longterm objectives of the fund it may sell the securities principal risks of investing in the fund the archer dividend growth fund is subject to management risk and the fund may not achieve its objective if the advisor s expectations regarding particular securities or interest rates are not met an investment in this fund or any other fund may not provide a complete investment program the suitability of an investment in the fund should be considered based on the investment objective strategies and risks described in this prospectus considered in light of all of the other investments in your portfolio as well as your risk tolerance financial goals and time horizons you may want to consult with a financial advisor to determine if this fund is suitable for you investors in the fund should have a longterm perspective and for example be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value the prices of securities held by the fund may decline in response to certain events taking place around the world including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by the fund conditions affecting the general economy overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic  instability and currency interest rate and commodity price fluctuations the common stock and other equity type securities purchased by the fund may involve large price swings and potential for loss investments in securities issued by entities based outside the united states may also be affected by currency controls different accounting auditing financial reporting and legal standards and practices expropriation changes in tax policy greater market volatility differing securities market structures higher transaction costs and various administrative difficulties such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of dividends these risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets investments in securities issued by entities domiciled in the united states may also be subject to many of these risks your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency entity or person you may lose money by investing in the fund the fund s performance could be hurt by active management risk due to its active management the fund s performance could underperform its benchmark index andor other funds with similar investment objectives market risk of equity securities by investing in stocks the fund may expose you to a sudden decline in the share price of a particular portfolio holding or to an overall decline in the stock market in addition the funds principal market segment may underperform other segments or the market as a whole the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate daily and cyclically based on movements in the stock market and the activities of individual companies in the funds portfolio common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change preferred stock is subject to the risk that the dividend on the stock may be changed or omitted by the issuer and that participation in the growth of the issuer may be limited preferred stock typically has preference over common stock in the payment of distributions and the liquidation of a companys assets but is subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in addition preferred stock holders generally do not have voting rights with respect to the issuing company issuer risk an issuer in which the fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly and the value of its securities may therefore decline which would negatively affect the fund s performance poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions competitive pressures breakthroughs in technology reliance on suppliers labor problems or shortages corporate restructurings fraudulent disclosures natural disasters or other events conditions or factors real estate risk to the extent the fund invests in reits it is subject to risks generally associated with investing in real estate such as i possible declines in the value of real estate ii adverse general and local economic conditions iii possible lack of availability of mortgage funds iv changes in interest rates and v environmental problems in addition reits are subject to certain other risks related specifically to their structure and focus such as dependency upon management skills limited diversification the risks of locating and managing financing for projects heavy cash flow dependency possible default by borrowers the costs and potential losses of selfliquidation of one or more holdings the possibility of failing to maintain exemptions from securities registration and in many cases relatively small market capitalization which may result in less market liquidity and greater price volatility depositary receipts risk depositary receipts are receipts issued by a bank or trust company reflecting ownership of underlying securities issued by foreign companies some foreign securities are traded in the form  of american depositary receipts adrs depositary receipts involve risks similar to the risks associated with investments in foreign securities including those associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer which may be related to the particular political regulatory economic social and other conditions or events occurring in the country and fluctuations in its currency as well as market risk tied to the underlying foreign company in addition adr holders may have limited voting rights may not have the same rights afforded typical company stockholders in the event of a corporate action such as an acquisition merger or rights offering and may experience difficulty in receiving company stockholder communications foreign securities risk investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of us companies foreign securities subject the fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer including the political regulatory economic social diplomatic and other conditions or events occurring in the country or region as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of us companies and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country its nationals or industries or businesses within the country in addition foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the fund s income capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities which could reduce the fund s return on such securities the performance of the fund may also be negatively impacted by fluctuations in a foreign currency s strength or weakness relative to the us dollar particularly to the extent the fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar growth securities risk growth securities typically trade at a higher multiple of earnings than other types of equity securities accordingly the market values of growth securities may never reach their expected market value and may decline in price in addition growth securities at times may not perform as well as value securities or the stock market in general and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time sector emphasis at times the fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in a related group of industries within an economic sector including the consumer discretionary health care and information technology and technologyrelated sectors companies in the same economic sector may be similarly affected by economic regulatory political or market events or conditions which may make the fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that economic sector than funds that invest more broadly generally the more broadly the fund invests the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility the fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the consumer discretionary sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors companies in the consumer discretionary sector are subject to certain risks including fluctuations in the performance of the overall domestic and international economy interest rate changes increased competition and consumer confidence performance of such companies may be affected by factors including reduced disposable household income reduced consumer spending changing demographics and consumer tastes the fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the health care sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors companies in the health care sector are subject to certain risks including restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses government approval of medical products and services competitive pricing pressures and the rising cost of medical products and services especially for companies dependent upon a relatively limited number of products or services performance of such companies may be affected by factors including government regulation obtaining and protecting patents or the failure to do so product liability and other similar litigation as well as product obsolescence  the fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector as well as other technologyrelated sectors collectively the technology sectors than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks including the risk that new services equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents or the failure to do so and significant competitive pressures including aggressive pricing of their products or services new market entrants competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings andor falling profit margins as a result the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise in addition many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies securities historically have been more volatile than other securities especially over the short term cybersecurity risk cybersecurity incidents may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to fund assets customer data including private shareholder information or proprietary information or cause the fund the manager any subadviser andor its service providers including but not limited to fund accountants custodians subcustodians transfer agents and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality dividend tax treatment there may be a significant change in legislation or policy affecting taxation on dividends which may affect the performance of the fund portfolio turnover risk the fund s investment strategy may result in a high portfolio turnover rate high portfolio turnover would result in correspondingly greater brokerage commission expenses and may result in the distribution to shareholders of additional capital gains for tax purposes these factors may negatively affect the fund s performance past performance performance information is not available at this time because the fund has not yet commenced operations as of the date of this prospectus and therefore has less than a full calendar year of investment operations in the future the fund will include a bar chart and table which will include such information that will provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund by showing the variability of performance and by comparing the funds performance to a broad measure of market performance remember the fund s past performance before and after taxes when such is provided is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future updated
