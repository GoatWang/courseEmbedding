net proceeds from this offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of this offering will be approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full based on the offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the initial public offering price range shown on the cover page of this prospectus we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders we plan to use the net proceeds from this offering to acquire and originate sbc assets in accordance with our business strategy described in this prospectus and for general business purposes including the payment of fees and expense reimbursements to our manager depending on the availability of our target assets until we invest the net proceeds of this offering we may pay down our financing arrangements including those with affiliates of the underwriters and may temporarily invest in interestbearing shortterm investments including money market accounts that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a reit these initial investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from our target assets we compete with numerous regional and community banks specialty finance companies savings and loan associations and other entities and we expect that others may be organized in the future the effect of the existence of additional reits and other institutions may be increased competition for the available supply of sbc assets suitable for purchase which may cause the price for such assets to rise additionally origination of sbc loans by our competitors may increase the availability of sbc loans which may result in a reduction of interest rates on sbc loans in the face of this competition we expect to have access to our managers professionals and their industry expertise which may provide us with a competitive advantage in sourcing transactions and help us assess acquisition and origination risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential assets additionally we believe that we are currently one of only a handful of active market participants in the secondary sbc loan market due to the special servicing expertise needed to effectively manage these assets the small size of each loan the uniqueness of the real properties that collateralize the loans and the need to bring residential mortgage credit analysis into the underwriting process we expect competitive demand for these assets to remain constrained we seek to manage credit risk through our loanlevel preorigination or preacquisition due diligence and underwriting processes which as of september   has limited the amount of realized losses however we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face company description we are a real estate finance company that acquires originates manages

borrowers contractual status is current and the borrower has made at least  of contractual payments due for principal and interest in the most recent quarter we consider a loan to be subperforming or nonperforming if the borrower does not meet the criteria of a performing loan our acquired performing loans represented approximately  of the carrying value and  of the upb of our total loan portfolio as of september   we typically acquire subperforming and nonperforming loans at a discount to their upb when we believe that resolution of the loans will provide attractive riskadjusted returns our
