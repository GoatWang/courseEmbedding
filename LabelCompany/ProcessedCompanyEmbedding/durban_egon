telsa’s  carcomparecardssponsoredterm sheetterm sheet — friday july brainstorm techmajor tech investor “unicorns” are too pricey for usbrian okeefejul  techfocused private equity fund silver lake is one of the most important investment firms in silicon valley but its partners aren’t putting their money into the valley’s hottest commodities—socalled unicorns or privately held startups with a valuation of  billion or morewhywhen that question was posed to silver lake managing partner egon durban he paused for several seconds before sighing deeply and offering a diplomatic answer“there will be a time and a place” said durban during an onstage interview on tuesday at fortune’s brainstorm tech conference in aspen presumably referring to a future scenario in which valuations have fallen significantly “these are great businesses this is the place where we’re confined by financial logic and linearity”in other words the prices are too darn high—and the risk might even be higherthe numbers just don’t work for the  billion silver lake “we’re a little bit financial weenies” he said apologetically“if i could buy the index i would” said durban if it were possible to buy every private tech startup for  million he said “that would probably be a good trade” but individual unicorns are off the table for his firm right nowbig legacy outoffavor technology companies however are another story these cashgenerating businesses said durban remain better riskadjusted opportunities than hypedup startupsdurban reminded the audience that three years ago at brainstorm tech he told that year’s attendees that “a dollar of cash flow in a large tech company is fundamentally mispriced” he still thinks it’s truewhen durban walked off the stage at brainstorm tech after that appearance in  he was introduced to michael dell for the first time that meeting eventually led to silver lake working with dell on a  billion buyout of his company in how’s that big investment faringdurban said that dell is generating a lot of cash flow and has paid down enough debt to have its rating boosted two notches to just below investment grade he expects  to be a bit more “challenging” year because of product cycles out of the company’s control but said that it’s all relative “you see large technology companies talking about big layoffs” said durban “that’s not the case at dell”the investor said that he sees a lot of potential for dell to break out businesses from within dell to unlock value along the lines of the emc federation model but no transaction of that type is imminent he saidneither apparently is an ipo durban professed not to be in a hurry to push for that payday saying that there were many examples of silver lake owning a company for more than a decade he said there are plenty of options for an exit and “the goal is not going public—it’s just a step along the journey”customer servicesite mapprivacy policyadvertisingad choicesterms of useyour california privacy rightscareers
