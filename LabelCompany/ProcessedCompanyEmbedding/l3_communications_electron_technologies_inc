by  hughes microwave tube division was operating in culver city california hughes was developing twts suitable for airborne radar and eventually won the contract for the f radar system by the time the f program went into production the tube division had outgrown the culver city facility hughes moved the operation to torrance california and it became electron dynamics division edd general motors purchased hughes aircraft company in  and renamed the torrance operations electron dynamics division a subsidiary of gm hughes electronics maintaining the initials edd the boeing company purchased gms satellite operation in  acquiring edd in the process and renamed it boeing satellite systems electron dynamic devices again maintaining the initials edd boeing sold edd to l communications inc in  l already owned another company using the initials edd thereby prompting a name change to l communications electron technologies inc or eti for short boeing sold the property in torrance to rreef america reit iii corporation rreef in october  l consolidationsedit in  varian associates started the modern microwave tube industry and by  there were some  us companies involved with microwave tubes consolidations began during the mids and continued through the s four california companies litton varian hughes and teledyne emerged as the survivors varian became communication power industries cpi litton was acquired first by northrop grumman which continued operating the company as litton and months later sold it to l communications hughes was acquired by gm boeing and finally l in  l announced the closure of its california tube labs division in watsonville ca and moved the assets to their san carlos and williamsport pa facilities in mid l announced they were again consolidating their microwave products companies with most of the electron devices san carlos ca facility as well as the name moving to the former hughes facility located in southern california the new company would be known as l electron devices division thereby returning the initials edd to the torrance facility and closing the legacy litton electron tube factory on  december  ls company name changed from

then as litton industries had about  employees about  of which were working on vacuum tubes by  the business had grown to be about half manufacturing equipment and half tubes after receiving a contract for a magnetron designated the j as well as followon contracts the company became a major competitor to raytheon and very profitable in  charlie litton sold litton industries litton industries electron tube division grew rapidly due to the basic philosophy that had been espoused by charlie litton expressly that achieving good microwave characteristics required a high quality vacuum that philosophy led the company to select materials and manufacturing techniques that gave litton the ability to compete with larger companies in the early s litton industries bought sylvanias plant in williamsport pa and moved all magnetron production there during the s litton developed tubes and became second source for most of the hughes edds airborne radar tubes in  the northrop owned
