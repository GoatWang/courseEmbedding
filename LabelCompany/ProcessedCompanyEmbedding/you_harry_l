and shai™ shaving products web site and all content produced by eight horses chairman of the bordeaux  the university of chicago booth school of business  at home in the vineyards of southwestern france stephen bolger founded viniv a company that lets clients create their own custom bordeaux wines from grape to glass photograph courtesy of stephen bolger chairman of the bordeaux a personal tragedy prompted stephen bolger ’ exp to leave technology to build an awardwinning custom winemaking business in france share related alumni editor pick entrepreneurship my course correction perspectives winter  recommended stephen bolger ’ exp made his name in international management first in industrial minerals and then in technology but when bolger and his wife lost their first child a decision to align his career with something that had true meaning to him—and the emotional intelligence gained at booth—led him to pursue his passion for wine in the heart of bordeaux while at booth bolger took a class focused on creative thinking and what he learned there helped guide his career after working internationally for years and suffering that tragic loss bolger founded viniv a bordeauxbased “experiential” customwinemaking company that helps clients create not just a personalized product but a story to tell for the rest of their lives  i will never forget the class i took with professors john p “jack” gould and harry l davis it was focused on creative thinking and getting a better understanding of “me inc” which—when you’re a young rabblerouser—gives you an opportunity to take a step back and think about what motivates you  when we handed in a paper about our personal objectives davis called out a quote i’d used from photographer henri cartierbresson which said that in order to take a good photograph you had to put your mind heart and eye on the same axis i find that that is so true when i think about what i chose to do professionally when i started out in international sales in industrial minerals i loved the learning and travel while traveling my wife and i would run off to wineries to discover the landscapes the people and the wines my mother is french and i spent many holidays there so wine was always around our home  as i moved up the ladder i became responsible for the company’s international operations including production facilities in europe and africa i realized that i had an operational shortfall and that’s why i sought out the mba henri cartierbresson said that in order to take a good photograph you had to put your mind heart and eye on the same axis  that is so true when i think about what i chose to do professionally stephen bolger ’ exp a great thing about booth was that it quickly gave me the tool kit required to operate in a field i didn’t initially understand well it turbo boosted my ability to deal with the challenges that i had to address while growing an international manufacturing and sales operation while at school i had many selfrevelations in addition to business learning i discovered the importance of emotional intelligence and the humility required to know what i didn’t do well this has constantly helped me to surround myself with the right people in all of my endeavors after my career in industrial minerals i moved into technology joining a londonbased business with two graduates from my booth program next i was recruited by the four largest steel producers in europe to run a technology consortium  then a seismic event occurred my wife and i lost our first child it’s one of those things where the world slows down and almost completely stops you start framing your life choices in such a way that you want them to have more meaning and one of the conclusions was that i didn’t want to spend the next half of my career in any industry where i couldn’t apply my axis my heart head and eye that’s what led me to the wine industry viniv helps individuals and corporations produce their own premium bordeaux wine and live out a truly unique experience we created a winery dedicated to smalllot wine production sourced vineyards in the most prestigious appellations margaux pauillac pomerol and our technical team—my partners at château lynchbages—guide our clients throughout the winemaking process then it’s up to my clients to decide the style of wine they want to produce and their level of immersion in the overall experience for example they can choose to work the vineyards participate at harvest refine their barrel blend and create a brand and label that is a true reflection of their wine story  so far viniv clients have come from  countries they include bankers lawyers entrepreneurs celebrities and heads of state sixty percent return for another vintage i love the relationship with clients because wine usually brings out a number of meaningful stories and memories it’s a product that generates emotion and our clients come to bordeaux to learn they’re saying “shock me give me the behindthescenes information about how the bordeaux wine world works” and that’s the sweet spot that’s what i love to do —as told to gretchen kalwinski share products and
