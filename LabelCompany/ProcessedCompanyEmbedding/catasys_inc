catasys inc dec    et share this article los angeles dec   prnewswire  increasing utilization and expansions from health plans to increase equivalent lives under contract in  to more than  million such adoption portends to a cash receipts run rate of approximately  million  months from launch dear catasys shareholder we are pleased to update you our valued shareholder on the exciting events occurring throughout our business and will be taking steps to provide additional visibility into our progress going forward the rapid pace at which we are expanding our engagements with the major us health plans has dramatically increased the total number of equivalent lives we are reporting at the end of   this growth is expected to have a significant impact on our financial performance for  the healthcare industry in particular health insurance companies and plans typically take many years to allow a new entrant such as us to gain significant traction it has taken the company several years to prove out our business model as it is currently accepted by many national health plan providers during this time we have found it virtually impossible to have enough visibility in our business to publicly provide accurate financial guidance and direction through this letter we hope that you will sense something must be changing given our newly communicative posture further we will briefly discuss our vision the healthcare industry issues that we are addressing the proprietary nature of our products the scalable nature of our business and our near term expectations company vision and solution the companys vision is to improve the behavioral health industry by providing an innovative proactive treatment solution with cost saving opportunities for health plan customers and ultimately be able to scale its availability on a national and perhaps one day international basis today we are focused on substance use disorder sud depression and anxiety which comprises approximately  of behavioral health disorders the us currently has a passive system whereby treatment avoidant patients cost denial stigma access need to seek out treatment gain access to treatment afford said treatment and then receive the appropriate care that addresses both the physiological and psychsocial aspects integrative care of these complex diseases unfortunately the more severe patients we serve have these diseases as comorbid conditions of each other and have other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diabetes renal liver disease etc the average amount of costs associated with these patients directly related to the behavioral diseases alone is  these costs are predominantly from emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays catasys provides an integrated outpatient solution with proprietary analytics and predictive modeling proprietary enrollment engagement and modification of behavior techniques our solution effectively turns the passive system treatment avoidant minimal access to care unidentified patient population to a proactive replicable scalable national solution where we focus on the complete care of the patients the results from our solution have shown that patients are getting better and the health insurance companies are consistently saving  of the medical costs for each patient enrolled hence there is a health plan incentive to pay for all the associated treatment costs through ontrak behavioral health patients now have full treatment program coverage increased access to treatment and effective care first quarter and full year  catasys has emerged as a leading healthcare analytics company providing proprietary valueadded care for health plan members we are like amazon and uber to the  standard facilitiesbased behavioral health industry model as we are virtual and scalable throughout the country utilizing provider networks of independent contracted medical doctors and psychologists companioned with our own care coaches in an outpatient setting all of our existing health plan customers including humana aetna centene and hamp have expanded ontrak to their other products and expanded geographically we are now operating in  states with more to come this week we have seen for the first time that one of our customers expanded from our sud ontrak program to the ontrak treatment of sud depression and anxiety while we have been growing revenues significantly yearoveryear and sequentially the numbers are quite small relative to what we expect in the coming year and beyond we have worked through much of the customer specific logistical issues in  that limited our revenues and it appears that the perfect storm is beginning to culminate in the first quarter of  perfect storm we anticipate shortly that all of our existing customers will be operating at or near full capacity for the lives under contract by the end of the first quarter of  with additional opportunities to expand we expect this growth to come throughout their eligible members including medicare medicaid commercial individual and hopefully tricare military and veterans as well as expansion throughout our depression and anxiety offerings its important to note that when a health plan contracts ontrak for depression anxiety and sud it represents an approximately x increase of the eligible population from which we enroll we began the year with at or under  enrollment rates of eligible lives we are constantly trying to improve our techniques and we are beginning to see the results while we are only one quarter in we are currently seeing a  enrollment rate which exceeds our expectations another input to the storm is additional health insurance contracts we expect to add more national and superregional health plans this will be a major impetus to revenue growth excitingly we expect many of the new contracts to include the treatment of depression and anxiety these will be the first instances of new customers contracting for all three disease states we are hopeful that in  we will have contracts in place with health plans that represent in excess of  of the commercially covered lives in the usa  we are hopeful that we will have contracts with  of the  largest health plans in the country importantly all of our existing and future customers will continue to benefit from the trend in place and expected to accelerate with the next administration of more of the medicare and medicaid populations moving to managed care these populations have an approximately x the eligible patients from which we enroll than a commercial population unfortunately another tailwind is the increasing rates of mental illness in the us in a survey released this week one out of six adults take psychiatric medications alarmingly  of them are prescribed multiple refills this is indicative of rising dependencies and associated medical costs the government increasingly recognizes the us mental health problem and has instituted the mental health parity act and this week the st century cures act became law thereby improving us mental health efforts the result large projected revenue streams we believe that in  we will nearly triple our equivalent lives els under contract from the current  million we have in place each  million els is anticipated to equate to a cash receipts run rate  months from launch of  million  hence  million els could translate to a cash receipts run rate of approximately  million  months from launch excitingly this is only the beginning and would expect significant revenue and cash flow growth rates for years to come we are extremely excited for catasys future growth  i certainly hope that you can sense my excitement for the coming years perhaps now you can understand why i personally invested in excess of  million into catasys inc thank you for remaining dedicated to our companys vision which will hopefully transform the behavioral health industry i

 reasons to look at catasys catsotc over the past several decades there has been a change in how the us views mental health issues today a conversation about a tragic shooting has transitioned from being an “nra issue” to a “mental health issue” with these topics being picked up by industry media and politicians alike with neardaily news reports of teenage or young adult suicides attacks on family military schools movie theaters and so on by undiagnosed and untreated individuals and a rise in accidental drug overdoses from both illicit and prescription products conversations have begun to focus on increasing fairness in health insurance for behavioral and mental health conditions while reducing the stigma costs and hopelessness of seeking treatment for those who are suffering from a mental or substance disorder substance abuse costs the us over  billion annually due to crime lost work productivity and healthcare there is a need for more efficient methods of engaging and treating substancedependent individuals such as what catasys is working toward in order to rectify the treatment gap that currently exists as individuals seek treatment for a physical infirmity but not for an underlying behavioral health condition as of  approximately  million us residents or  of the population needed treatment for a problem related to drugs or alcohol though only  million people  had received treatment at a specialty facility source national survey on drug use and health catasys offers a new method of integrated substance dependence therapy to health plans and employers for its members through the company’s proprietary ontrak™ program employing analytics and proprietary engagement techniques to enroll and engage participants in need of care and patientcentric treatment the ontrak™ program has been developed to improve treatment outcomes and lower the utilization of medical health plan services by highusehighrisk enrollees its services integrate medical interventions a proprietary webbased clinical information platform and database manualized psychosocial programs and care coaching services in a week outpatient program in any given day period  of the us population is on five or more prescription drugs many common combinations of which are extremely habitforming and have a high rate of abuse by patients source cdc as such there is a need for substance abuse programs to include physicians trained to fully assess not only the substance dependence but also any other comorbid conditions and concerns that may inhibit better health catasys has found that many of the highutilizer individuals identified by its program tend to have chronic and interrelated comorbid conditions that also need to be managed seeking to transform the entire health management services system the ontrak™ program has shown to improve member health while reducing inpatient stays emergency room utilization and insurers’ total healthcare costs for enrolled members by more than  the company’s system is set up with the intent of benefitting healthcare insurerspayers through cost savings patients financially and medically including encouraging better treatment outcomes as people do not have to avoid treatment or leave the program early due to cost since for most members it is  covered under their health plan and catasys catasys reports that it holds contracts with a number of health insurance plans for the ontrak™ program including aetnacoventry humana and centene ontrak™ is presently available in florida illinois kansas kentucky louisiana massachusetts new jersey oklahoma west virginia and wisconsin these contracts cover approximately  million commercially equivalent lives cels management has specified that it has a sales pipeline with insurers for an additional  million cels of which it is in advanced stages of discussion for about four million catasys’ pipeline reportedly includes existing customers that have acknowledged the value of ontrak™ and are considering expanding it to additional geographies or lines of business catasys’ proprietary data analytics enables it to identify highcost substancedependent members within health insurance plans who have the potential to have reduced costs through effective treatment of their behavioral health conditions the company then reaches out to these specific members and has historically been able to persuade an average of  of a plan’s eligible substancedependent individuals to enroll in the ontrak™ treatment program highcost substancedependent members cost commercial health plans an estimated eight times more than other members averaging  in annual claims versus  for a “normal” covered life catasys’ data indicates that patients enrolled in the ontrak™ program exhibit a reduction in claims cost of over  since health insurers are under constant pressure to reduce costs they have an incentive to pay catasys to enroll members in the ontrak™ program catasys’ program is helping make substance dependency treatment the same as any medical pharmacological or pharmaceutical treatment where catasys is the treatment the company has shown that if payersinsurers pay catasys  per commercial life  for a medicaremedicaid life—which covers the patient’s treatment expenses in the week ontrak™ outpatient program—the insurer may see a potential savings in the first year of  given that it costs a payerinsurer approximately  in claims costs for these substancedependent patients and catasys has shown a  reduction in claims cost the cost savings is expected to continue after the first year as well as be higher as there is no fee per patient in the second year to catasys’ knowledge ontrak™ is the only program of its kind entirely devoted to substance dependence developed by specialists in addiction ontrak™ has facilitated the formation of key areas of expertise differentiating catasys from others through member engagement working directly with the member treatment team providing a consistent evidencebased treatment across geographies and a more fully integrated treatment offering catasys can provide its insurance plan customers with outcomes reporting as it relates to clinical and financial metrics to demonstrate and confirm the value of its program—with data showing an average gross cost reduction of over  as measured from the prior  months of enrollment furthermore roughly  of members who have remained eligible have stayed in the program to date the company’s model has been validated in its quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear growth for the second quarter  ended june   revenue was up  to  versus  reported for the second quarter  catasys also reported a  growth in enrollment in the second quarter  versus the first quarter  which was driven by the expansion of the company’s ontrak™ program catasys recently expanded its wisconsin program with a national health plan to include its medicare advantage members added a new behavioral health condition anxiety in kansas and entered into an agreement with a new customer in illinois that commenced enrollment during the third quarter  for the first six months of  the company reported revenue of  versus revenue of  in the first half of  there are an estimated  million lives covered under managed care in the us for every  million members in a healthcare plan approximately  million in claims are incurred by commercial plan members diagnosed with substance dependence equating into what could be a  billion market opportunity according to company calculations catasys further has the opportunity to expand into other highcost undermanaged populations having behavioral health diagnoses such as anxiety as it has recently announced and depressive disorders—which could more than quadruple its current market opportunity catasys is run by senior management that collectively has over  years of substance dependence treatment experience and over  years of healthcare experience having developed an expertise in engaging treating and empowering members with coexisting medical and behavioral conditions to modify their behavior terren s peizer director chairman of the board and chief executive officer ceo has personally invested approximately  million into catasys—somewhat uncharacteristic for a microcap company catasys holds certain technology knowhow and related intangible assets with respect to its ontrak™ treatment programs as of august   catasys reported a balance of approximately  cash on hand the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as of june   and

show that the company is in dire need of cashthe company has seen paid promotions from third partiesinsiders control over  of the companys common stockexecutives compensation vastly exceeds the companys meansi have attempted to contact management via the companys website about these issuesbackground catasys inc otcqbcats is a nevadaincorporated firm that is engaged in the business of healthcare management services recently the companys stock has undergone a series of paid promotions from third party entities and insiders control over  of the companys stock the companys filings also show that the companys finances are in poor shape but the top executives have consistently received very generous compensation packages business and corporate history as mentioned before catasys inc provides healthcare management services to health plans from the companys latest k catasys describes its business we provide specialized healthcare management services to health plans and other third party payers through our ontrak program our ontrak program is designed to improve member health and at the same time lower costs to the insurer for underserved populations where behavioral health conditions are exacerbating coexisting medical conditions the program utilizes member engagement and patient centric treatment that integrates evidence based medical and psychosocial interventions along with care coaching in a week outpatient program our initial focus has been members with substance use disorders but we have plans to expand into other behavioral health conditions including anxiety and depression we currently operate our ontrak for substance dependence program in florida kansas kentucky louisiana massachusetts new jersey oklahoma west virginia and wisconsin this description seems pretty straight forward but there are some crucial details that the company doesnt mention in its k prior to march   the company was known as hythiam inc which was also engaged in the specialized healthcare management services sector however the companys description is slightly different the k from march   reads we are a healthcare services company providing specialized behavioral health services for substance abuse to health plans employers and unions through a network of licensed healthcare providers and its employees the catasys substance dependence program ontrak was designed to address substance dependence as a chronic disease the program seeks to lower costs and improve member health through the delivery of integrated medical and psychosocial interventions combining elements of traditional disease management and ongoing care coaching including our proprietary prometa® treatment program for alcoholism and stimulant dependence the prometa treatment program which integrates behavioral nutritional and medical components is also available on a privatepay basis through licensed treatment providers and a company managed treatment center that offers the prometa treatment program as well as other treatments for substance dependencies in this description the company touts prometa as a flagship product however in subsequent filings the mention of prometa seemingly disappears after the k filed on april   there is no discussion in any of the later filings or on the companys website as to what happened to this product  it seems to have simply been abandoned however the april   k does mention this our prometa treatment program is not subject to approval by the fda and while the drugs incorporated in the prometa treatment program have been approved for other indications they are not fda approved for the treatment of alcohol or substance dependency we have not sought and do not intend to seek fda approval for the drugs as they are used in the prometa treatment program it is possible that in the future the fda could require us to seek fda approval for the drugs as they are used in the prometa treatment program this may provide an explanation why the program has disappeared from subsequent sec filings but i would really like to see some clarification by management as to the status of the program financials the companys latest s filed on may   after the most recent q which was filed on may   shows that the company currently has k in cash and cash equivalents and total current assets of k compared to current liabilities of  million and a working capital deficit of  million the cash flow statement shows that the companys operations used k in cash for the three months ended march   additionally the company has an accumulated deficit of  million in light of these figures it comes as no surprise that the companys auditors have issued a going concern notice on page  of the s which reads we have been unprofitable since our inception in  and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses and negative cash flow from operations for at least the next twelve months as of march  these conditions raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern as of march   cash and cash equivalents was approximately  and accumulated deficit was approximately  million during the periods ended december   and march   our cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities was  million and  respectively although we have recently taken actions to increase revenues and raised approximately  million of net proceeds in the bridge note financing we anticipate requiring additional financing including the financing contemplated by this prospectus we may not be successful in raising necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all and we may not be able to offset our operating losses by sufficient reductions in expenses and increases in revenue if this occurs we may be unable to meet our cash obligations as they become due and we may be required to further delay or reduce operating expenses and curtail our operations which would have a material adverse effect on us looks pretty bleak and confirms the financial concerns i pointed out earlier because of the s filing we already know that the company plans to raise additional funding through the sale of common stock which will further dilute current shareholders promotional history cats common stock has seen a series of promotional campaigns via email newsletters from otcbb journal and stocks impossible both of these newsletters disclosed compensation of  from a thirdparty entity known as edge media llc while there is no mention of edge media llc in catasys sec filings it is always a major concern when a third party promoter is willing to pay thousands of dollars to generate interest in a stock that has over  of the common shares held by insiders insider ownership and management compensation according to the latest s filed on may   two named shareholders hold beneficial ownership of  of cats outstanding stock such massive insider ownership especially in the period following a paid promotional campaign is a serious red flag and a great cause for concern among potential investors beyond the massive insider ownership it is important to note that page the companys top executives are very generously compensated the table below from page  of the most recent s shows salaries of   and  in  and   and  in  for the top three executives in light of the balance sheet and cash flow figures this compensation seems reckless and unsustainable it seems strange that the top executives received no option awards  i would think that a company that is strapped for cash would want to provide a major incentive for management to improve the companys standing in the capital markets rather than squander the companys meager cash on direct compensation given that the company currently has only  in cash and claims to have a workforce of  fulltime employees page  of the most recent s it seems impossible that the company to be able to continue to pay its workforce without massive external funding cats current cash holdings are barely enough for a few months of rent which the company claims to be  per month on page  of the most recent k conclusion the company has undergone two name changes a multitude of equity issuances and all it has to show for it is an accumulated deficit of  million and no clear path towards a solid foundation insiders have beneficial ownership of over  of the companys stock and top management still receives compensation that totals an order of magnitude greater than the companys current cash holdings beyond the woeful financial situation the company has undergone paid thirdparty promotions if you are considering a long position in cats common stock think again  the companys sec filings tell a lot that the promotional materials do not reveal disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in cats over the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article additional disclosure i may initiate a short position in cats over the next  hours i have attempted to contact management regarding the issues that i have seen and will update the article if they respond editors note this article covers one or more stocks
