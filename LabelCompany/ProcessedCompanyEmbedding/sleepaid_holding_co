supplement reviews of   sleepsupportsupplementscom insomnia facts what are sleep disorders our top sleep supplement reviews » top  sleep supplements of which brands think youre stupid if you’re looking for a better sleep support supplement look no further posted on by paul grudnitsky  sleepsupportsupplementscom see how we make our pick according to the center of disease control and prevention cdc  of adults in america aren’t getting enough sleep and sleeping less than seven hours a night is associated with serious health consequences obesity diabetes high blood pressure heart disease stroke and frequent mental stress   needless to say sleep is vital to your overall health and mental health so any interruptions in your normal sleep schedule should be taken seriously   « skip to our top reviewed sleep remedy »   “what causes sleep disorders”   the most common sleep disorder is insomnia which is when you’re unable to fall asleep or remain asleep and it’s usually the main reason people look for sleep remedies unfortunately this sleep disorder is extremely common and about  of american adults experience it at some point in their lives   there are a variety of causes but some of the most common are   stress anxiety and depression these are two of the most common causes of chronic insomnia stress anger worry anxiousness and negative thoughts can have a dramatic effect on sleep quality   stimulants excessive use of caffeine such as energy drinks and coffee is one of the most common causes of intermittent and transient insomnia this is insomnia that occurs periodically or only for a few nights at a time   medications some medications can interfere with sleep such as antidepressants adhd medication corticosteroids thyroid hormone high blood pressure medication some contraceptives pain relievers that contain caffeine diuretics and diet pills   allergies and respiratory problems colds sinus infections and upper respiratory problems can make it hard to breathe at night which can cause sleeping difficulties   nocturia frequent urination and constantly getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom causes sleep disturbances   chronic pain a variety of conditions that cause chronic pain can also disrupt sleep such as arthritis chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia inflammatory bowel disease headaches lower back pain   “how are sleep disorders treated”   the most common problem people have is falling asleep and staying asleep for serious sleep disorders a doctor may advise a prescription drug to be taken nightly   selective gammaaminobutyric acid medications ambien lunesta sonata these prescription medications target the gaba receptors in the brain gaba is the neurotransmitter that reduces alertness and promotes relaxation   unfortunately this medication is known to cause side effects like hallucinations memory disturbances and  “blackouts” wherein people report sleepwalking sleepeating and even sleepdriving   benzodiazepines xanax valium restoril halcion ativan typically prescribed for anxiety these prescription drugs activate the gaba receptors in the brain and cause sedation and relaxation they are considered extremely addictive with very difficult withdrawal symptoms and can cause a similar “blackout” effect with users   antihistamines benadryl advil pm dramamine unisom zzzquil etc these overthecounter antihistamines are a common alternative for people who don’t want to take prescription drugs the most common side effects of antihistamines are dryness constipation upset stomach and feeling groggy the next day   ​warning ​recently these common antihistamine sleep aids have been associated with an increased risk of dementia and various forms of mci mild cognitive impairment these sleep aids all have several things in common•  they’re unnatural pharmaceutical drugs•  they’re expensive•  they all come with serious sideeffects so the real question is   “are there any natural sleep remedies that actually work”   with any condition there will inevitably be a line of natural remedies created to help alleviate symptoms and build a path towards remission and health judging by the number of customers these companies have year after year the volume of verified testimonials and the support some of their ingredients have from the medical community they must be doing something right   these natural remedies are often used in order to avoid the cost inconvenience and side effects of prescription drugs and invasive treatments among so many choices we have to ask   “how do you separate the good products from the junk”   we have a passion for natural health and many of us have suffered from insomnia and sleep issues ourselves that’s why we went out and compared some of the top natural neuropathy remedies to see which ones really worked and which ones we can throw in the garbage   here’s what we looked for in a product   with years of experience our research team dove into stacks of medical journals and consumer reports and studied exactly how certain vitamins and herbs can promote relaxation and deep restful sleep we narrowed the list to  essential ingredients that no effective sleep remedy would be without   ​melatonin▼  click to read  ▼this is a ‘nobrianer’ for any sleep formula melatonin is the hormone made by your pineal gland that controls your sleep and wake cycles light affects melatonin production and your body will naturally release more melatonin at night which is why indoor lighting tvs and your cellphone’s brightness can disrupt sleep melatonin causes drowsiness lowers body temperature and puts the body into sleep modemagnesium▼  click to read  ▼this is one of the most vital minerals when it comes to relaxation sleep and mental health a magnesium deficiency can cause anxiety sleep disorders irritability and abnormal heart rhythms the relaxing sleepboosting properties of magnesium are well known one study shows that magnesium improved subjective measures of insomnia sleep efficiency sleep time and sleep onset theanine▼  click to read  ▼this amino acid promotes a sense of calm and has many observable antianxiety properties and this happens quickly usually within minutes by reducing anxiety and stress theanine helps ‘quiet’ the mind before sleep studies note that theanine improved overall sleep quality  essential herbs▼  click to read  ▼valerian root valerian root helps increase the amount of the neurotransmitter gaba in the brain which brings about relaxation and calm drugs like xanax and valium increase gaba synthetically but valerian is all natural and safe in one study  reported perfect sleep and  reported improved sleep with valerian root passionflower passionflower is actually listed as a tranquilizing herb in germany and its calming sleep inducing effects have been known for a long time it has a similar effect on anxiousness too so in combination with valerian root it’s a perfect way to slip into deep restful sleep several studies show it’s an effective remedy against anxiety lemon balm lemon balm is well studied it encourages deeper and more restful sleep as shown in a german sleep study additionally it’s an excellent antioxidant for the liver a brain booster that helps improve memory and mood booster as well hops it’s not just for beer studies show that those who drank nonalcoholic beer with hops actually had improved sleep quality and reduced levels of anxiety hops have a lot in common with valerian root as far as its relaxing calmpromoting effects which makes the two a perfect combination chamomile chamomile is a sleep remedy as old as time it’s most commonly consumed in the form of tea and its health benefits are incredible it’s an antiinflammatory helps with digestive issues helps with skin irritation helps get rid of sore throat and of course is an excellent sleep remedy liquid delivery method▼  click to read  ▼we gave a heavy favoritism to liquid extracts and it wasn’t for no good reason studies show the body uses  of the liquid extract compared to only about  of a capsule or tablet meaning the remainder of those ingredients and the money spent on them are just flushed down the toilet furthermore capsules have to travel through the stomach and liver before their ingredients are even available to the body while  of the liquid extract is absorbed in the first  seconds   what we looked for in a brand   ​strength of moneyback guarantee a moneyback guarantee shows the manufacturer is so confident in the product that they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is there’s simply no reason to trust a product that doesn’t offer a moneybackguarantee  hour customer support a hour customersupport service shows a manufacturer’s commitment to their customers because hour support isn’t cheap with any remedy you’re likely to have questions and those questions can arise at any time of the day or night hour customer service offers a peaceofmind knowing the answers are only a phone call away   what we discovered   there are tons and tons of sleep formulas out there and unfortunately most seem to be merely copycats of other sleep formulas as if they’re all buying the same product from one pill manufacturer and slapping on a different label and price   however some formulas did attempt to separate themselves from their competition and for us there was a clear winner what you will learn estimated read time   what causes sleep disorders   how are sleep disorders treated   is there a sleep remedy that actually

renminbi rmb rmb is still not a freely exchangeable currency since  the state administration of foreign exchange of china has promulgated a series of circulars and rules in order to enhance verification of foreign exchange payments under a chinese entitys current account items and has imposed strict requirements on borrowing and repayments of foreign exchange debts from and to foreign creditors under the capital account items and on the creation of foreign security in favor of foreign creditors this may complicate foreign exchange payments to foreign creditors under the current account items and thus may affect the ability to borrow under international commercial loans the creation of foreign security and the borrowing of rmb under guarantees in foreign currencies moreover the value of rmb may become subject to supply and demand which could be largely impacted by international economic and political environments any fluctuations in the exchange rate of rmb could have an

subscribe sleep consumers are looking for natural alternatives but whats holding the category back by stephen daniellsstephen daniells jantzlast updated on jan at  gmttz the institute of medicine estimates that between  and  million american adults suffer from sleep or wakefulness disorder related tags sleep aids zzzquil somnapure sleep melatonin valerian the overall sleep aid category is growing at an eyewatering  and is expected to hit  million in  but natural products and dietary supplements only occupy a small portion of the market nutraingredientsusa explores the challenges and opportunities for the sector researcher dr michael grandner from the university of pennsylvania knows sleep better than many having spent his academic career studying it “sleep is involved in a very large number of physiological processes” he told attendees at the crn’s day of science in november “sleep is critical for healing and recovery the less sleep you get the more impaired you are and the deficits are cumulative”“awareness of the importance of sleep is growing and the motivation to get better sleep is growing” he addeddata from the datamonitor consumer  survey found that “insomnia” was tied for the fourth most prominent health issue of american consumers ranked by percentage coming in behind stress tiredness and fatigue which itself is related to sleep and allergy“across all age groups  of american women say they are concerned about insomnia now versus just  of men” said tom vierhile innovation insights director for datamonitor consumer “by age group middleage women are the most worried about insomnia”‘the majority of the consumers for these products are in cvs and walgreens’daniel wallace ceo of nutraclick told us that his company saw potential in the sleep category in late  and its second major product launch was positioned for that category the company’s somnapure natural sleep aid product now commands the largest store retail footprint of any of its other products the product is formulated with a combination of ingredients including valerian root ltheanine hops chamomile melatonin lemon balm extract and passion flower extract“somnapure launched really well in gnc” he said” but the majority of the consumers for these products are in cvs and walgreens”“the problem with the category is that it is really diversified in terms of the user base” said wallace “the number and type of people who want to find solutions is really varied”but such a diverse consumer base does have advantages “as we spin out to other retailers it doesn’t hurt existing ones” said wallace somnapure is now available in retailers such as walmart cvs walgreens gnc harris teeter and meijerthe market increasingly hectic work and school schedules overstimulation via portable electronics and their networks and the popularity of energyboosting drinks and tonics all serve to get people up earlier and keep them up later in modern us society says euromonitor natural sleep aids experienced a few years of good growth until pg’s zzzquil launched in  to become a  million brand almost overnight pg quickly took over the category lead with a  share of value sales according to euromonitor international“pg came in with zzzquil and took the majority of the market share” observed wallace “natural products have to compete with large cpg and pharma”of the current  million market for calming and sleep aids about   million comes from branded calming and sleeping products containing analgesics including tylenol pm advil pm excedrin pm and most recently aleve pm explained mark strobel consumer health analyst with euromonitorother branded standard sleep aids including zzzquil most unisom products simply sleep drive the majority of sales in the category with approximately us million while private label accounts for another us millionby far the smallest portion of sales comes from herbaltraditional calming and sleeping products said strobel accounting for  million in “herbaltraditional calming and sleeping aids and supplements containing melatonin have actually posted declines in both  and ” he said “while natural and herbal calming and sleeping remedies continue to grow in popularity among certain consumers and are perceived by some as safer with fewer side effects relative to other standard sleep aids with pharmaceutical ingredients these herbaltraditional sleep aids suffered  declines in retail value sales between  and  “the rise of new standard products like pg’s zzzquil and the return of brands like johnson  johnson’s simply sleep and novartis’s excedrin pm have been too much to overcome however as the growth of standard products like zzzquil begin to plateau more consumers may turn back to natural products that they perceive to be less addictive and have fewer side effects like residual drowsiness and grogginess” source euromonitor international ‘there are a lot of products on the market but it’s difficult to recommend many of them’and if natural products are to get back to  levels or more see chart above then the industry and academia must “demonstrate that some of these things work” said dr grandner“there are a lot of products on the market in the supplement space but it’s difficult to recommend many of them” he said during his presentation at the crn eventthe elephant in the room for sleep ingredients is melatonin “most people have heard of it but don’t really know what it does” said dr grandner “it’s a hormone that the brain uses to tell your body that it is night light affects it”numerous dietary supplement products can be found in retailers across the country with many giving the direction to take  minutes before bedtime such directions are wrong according to dr grandner “the ideal time to take melatonin is  hours before your peak sleep” he said “it’s not a sedative”valeriananother key player in this sector is valerian valeriana officinalis an herb that contains gammaaminobutyric acid gaba a neurotransmitter and may also increase gaba release“valerian contains gaba” said dr grandner “but it doesn’t cross the bloodbrain barrier however valerian has been evaluated in a lot of studies”indeed a  metaanalysis of  randomized clinical trials involving valerian’s potential sleep benefits sleep medicine  vol  pp  concluded that “the qualitative dichotomic results suggest that valerian would be effective for subjective improvement of insomnia although its effectiveness has not been demonstrated with quantitative or objective measurements nevertheless its use can be considered for some patients given its safety”other ingredients with varying degrees of support include tryptophan chamomile “there is a glaring absence of clinical trial data in humans” said dr grandner hops “they do have active sedative properties” tart cherries vitamin c lower levels associated with shorter  more disturbed sleep he noted magnesium potassium sodium and selenium lower levels associated with less sleep and iron linked to restless leg syndrome“it’s a time of great opportunity for natural products in the sleep category” said dr grandner “and there is a tremendous opportunity
