laboratoriesheather clancytuesday october    am sara greenstein ul how she leads is a regular greenbiz feature spotlighting the careers of women who have moved into influential roles in sustainable business sara greenstein jokes that her first university economics class had more people than the central illinois farm town where she was raised now shes a selfdescribed global citizen as president of uls supply chain operations and sustainability business units and a member of the executive team greenstein shepherds the companys mission to bring safe sustainable and compliant products to the global marketplace among two of its biggest accomplishments an ongoing quest to accelerate adoption of zerowaste strategies and a mission to support more transparency about whats in products consumed around the world greenstein was instrumental in expanding its footprint in japan india and china and more recently was behind the acquisitions of ides and innovadex since combined into a massive materials information database she landed at ul after several classic business process strategy assignments with the likes of boston consulting group and arthur andersen business consulting in her mind it was a shortterm gig thirteen years later i am here and have had a lot of various roles she told greenbiz through all of them ive been able to have an impact on our mission and on our business which i think is the primary thing that has kept me here i spoke with greenstein about what shapes uls philosophy and why sound science is important for meaningful progress heather clancy give me a sense of uls reach and where you believe that it has the most impact  sara greenstein we have been active pioneers in terms of leadership standards product certifications and testing methodologies and sound science that has fed current environmental practices as we move forward were taking that what i call sciencebacked technologyenabled capability and embedding it in the supply chain — all the way back to the raw materials and every other link thereafter to the end product — to help understand broader social impacts environmental impacts and human health impacts  you can only do that when youve got a framework that includes consensusbased standards that includes thirdparty verification of performance and efficacy against those standards and the technology connectivity and security thats required to link all those various strains in a very global and complex world from a ul perspective our mission — im sorry our reach — will only continue to evolve from where we are today both organically and inorganically  clancy how have the acquisitions of ides and innovadex expanded uls services greenstein we are able to provide the technology across the supply chain so decision makers can force products that are healthy safe and sustainable and either formulate if its a material if its a chemical or chemically formulated product or design … a product to meet multiple requirements — compliance requirements perhaps performance requirements sustainability requirements andor individual brand requirements that are being asked of them  learn more about sustainable supply chains at verge sf  oct  where ul prospector the combined ides and innovadex platform comes into play is as a public forum where hundreds of thousands of formulators come every day to get technical information they need when determining what materials to buy to formulate a product our supply chain software offers a very datasecure environment where suppliers provide very important information in a proprietary fashion that enables them to respond to any compliance requirements that are asked of them by any decision maker further down the supply chain  a retailer or a brand or a endproduct manufacturer has requirements that they demand whether its because they have to comply with various regulations around the country or the globe or because of their own internal policies and requirements we have a connected secure mechanism by which we feed that information up and down the chain we layer our environmental and sustainability standards as filters onto that information the end result is all about safe healthy sustainable products and processes to produce those products   clancy a moment ago you referred to growth organic and otherwise so can we expect any additional acquisitions greenstein i think the answer is yes we are at the beginning of a long journey and to be honest the strategy that we are deploying is one that is i believe going to continue to grow for decades from my perspective and this is something that we talk about pretty intensely here at ul supply chain the whole notion of safe in the broadest sense — safe secure sustainable supply chains and the science of sustainability — are to the next century what electrical and fire safety were to the last we are actively investing and charging hard to do what we can do to solve that safety challenge its our mission  clancy recognizing that you have a pretty big purview what would you say is your teams most important priority greenstein i think the most important priority for the next probably six to  months will be to drive consensus in the market amongst the diverse stakeholders around a common set of requirements all of which improve the state of sustainability if you will to get everybody working from the same page recognizing that continuous improvement can only happen once weve got a common set of criteria and standards from which to work from that true innovation and improvement can occur in the absence of that there are inefficiencies and therefore less productive work underway for everybody for everybody along the supply chain the sooner we can gain consensus with real science and experience around a common set of sustainability and regulatory compliance for major markets the faster progress can be made  clancy youve spent a lot of time in japan india and china so how has that impacted your perspective  greenstein i think one of the most enriching things about my journey here at ul has been that ive become a citizen of the globe right so i am as comfortable in the business environment in china japan korea taiwan singapore as i am in germany and italy and the united states  for me it boils down to what we do here and the reason why we do it which is to provide safe living and working environments for people around the world this matters everywhere at the end of the day i lead from a place of i care i genuinely care about the people who work for me who work with me and who we are doing this work for … traveling the world engaging with clients and colleagues and governments around the world just continues to invigorate why this matters and why we have to have perseverance and succeed here because  years ago in the united states people worried about plugging electronics in we don’t worry about that here anymore but we do worry about known carcinogens that our children are absorbing that we are unknowingly causing if you see a river in china thats totally black because of the chemicals that have leeched into it or the air there is so thick you can hardly breathe you absolutely worry being a global citizen of business just reinforces how connected we are how our basic human needs are all similar and frankly why we have a responsibility to address it  clancy youre going to have more accomplishments in the future of course but up to this time what do you consider to be your most important accomplishment  greenstein to me its my husband and three children ill also give you the professional one but i think for me having someone who i adore and adores me back kind of helps balance everything and having three healthy happy children i feel blessed and grateful every day for that professionally i think its having the opportunity to shape such an impactful business and really have the impact that i think ul has had and is positioned to have and simultaneously watch the people that work for me grow and develop beyond where i think they probably thought they could thats what gives me the most satisfaction  clancy who has been your most inspirational mentor  greenstein im going to offer the following i think the most important person who helps me do what i do the way i do it is my husband he serves as everything from sounding board to support to friend and husband at times when i am working out what to do or how to do what i know needs to be done knowing that i have such a strong foundation gives me the extra little push to do what needs to be done what we do takes courage there are fewer people who are willing to be brutally honest than i would hope hes a very steady presence in my life and i think he has had a big impact in helping me get to where i am  clancy what advice would you give to someone aspiring to a career similar to yours greenstein i say first of all listen i think listening is one of the most lifechanging skills — listening to others and listening to yourself being able to listen being willing to ask questions is critical in life and in business  and then i would say be who you are ive grown up in prominently maletype environments — both in the consulting world and then ul the engineering firm … i always encourage people to just be who they are and be less concerned about what they think they should be and be very honest about who they are know thyself if someone is in alignment with who they are and is able to listen to others and themselves they will succeed because they will
