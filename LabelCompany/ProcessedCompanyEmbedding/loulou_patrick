about the royal occasion event hosted at koerner hall by the royal conservatory of music but hey i was there again on tuesday after my friend isabel who works at the conservatory invited me to the launch party for their  concert season so here’s another post about this beautiful venue the evening began with a presentation inside the hall where we were told about all the exciting concerts scheduled for the next year between the talking we were treated to some wonderful performances including a piano piece played by prodigy rosina grieco a jazz trio led by saxophonist allison au a song enchantingly performed by jaffa road and a couple of opera pieces by soprano monica whicher and pianist rachel andrist tickets for the many shows on the roster will be sold beginning on june th for members of the conservatory and then for anyone beginning on june 2th you can see the complete listing on their website to quote writer robert harris for the globe and mail in this article “royal conservatory of music’s new season will be an embarrassment of riches” unlike the challenging to photograph candlelit environment at the royal occasion this event was held while there was still some sunlight so you can get a better look at the foyer at koerner hall the glass enclosure is situated a story above ground so you’re right amoungst the treetops isabel and i got a glass of wine and headed outdoors to the terrace …  looking at the eastern side of the royal ontario museum next door  a funny thing happened as i was getting dressed … i was all ready to go out the door when i put on the new jacket i’d chosen to wear to find that the storeclerk had forgotten to remove that big plastic magnetic tag thing from it so i had to change my whole outfit really quickly once the crowds around the food tables thinned out we went back in to enjoy some food there were generous platters of middleeastern style hors d’eouvres set out laden with delicious tidbids  once again their florist nailed it  before heading home we popped over to isabel’s office located in the old part of the building last autumn i showed you this gorgeous historic building in this post after i went on a spooky tour there it is said to be haunted so issy was giving tours at hallowe’en i believe hers to be a dream job — she gets to do something interesting that is related to her university degree in music and all her colleagues that i’ve met are very nice plus she gets to work within these gorgeous walls she’s a fortunate lady for that and i am fortunate to call her a friend thank you very much for
