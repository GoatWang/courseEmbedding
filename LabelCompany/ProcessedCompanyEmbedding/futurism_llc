such as the car the aeroplane and the industrial city although it was largely an italian phenomenon there were parallel movements in russia england belgium and elsewhere the futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design urban design theatre film fashion textiles literature music architecture and even futurist

external links italian futurismedit giacomo balla abstract speed  sound – futurism is an avantgarde movement founded in milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas  x  cm gianni mattioli collection on longterm loan to the peggy guggenheim collection venice joseph stella battle of lights coney island  oil on canvas  ×  cm  ×  in yale university art gallery new haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in the s the art historian giovanni lista has classified futurism by decades plastic dynamism for the first decade mechanical art for the s aeroaesthetics for the s an example of futurist architecture by antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony futurism in filmedit see also italian futurism cinema when interviewed about her favorite film of all times famed movie critic pauline kael stated that the director dimitri kirsanoff in his silent experimental film ménilmontant developed a technique that suggests the movement known in painting as futurism futurism in the s and sedit joseph stella  brooklyn bridge oil on canvas  x  cm yale university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre currently there are active neofuturist troupes in chicago new york san francisco and montreal japanese composer ryuichi sakamotos  album futurista was inspired

speed  sound – futurism is an avantgarde movement founded in milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas

haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in the s the art historian giovanni lista has classified futurism by decades plastic dynamism for the first decade mechanical art for the s aeroaesthetics for the s an example of futurist architecture by antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony

university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre currently there are active neofuturist troupes in chicago new york san francisco and montreal japanese composer ryuichi sakamotos  album futurista was inspired by the movement it

speed  sound – futurism is an avantgarde movement founded in milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas  x  cm gianni mattioli collection on longterm loan to the peggy guggenheim collection venice joseph stella battle of lights coney island  oil on canvas  ×  cm  ×  in yale university art gallery new haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in the s the art historian giovanni lista has classified futurism by decades plastic dynamism for the first decade mechanical art for the s aeroaesthetics for the s an example of futurist architecture by antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony

university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre currently there are active neofuturist troupes in chicago new york san francisco and montreal japanese composer ryuichi sakamotos  album futurista was inspired by the movement it

speed  sound – futurism is an avantgarde movement founded in milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas  x  cm gianni mattioli collection on longterm loan to the peggy guggenheim collection venice joseph stella battle of lights coney island  oil on canvas  ×  cm  ×  in yale university art gallery new haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in the s the art historian giovanni lista has classified futurism by decades plastic dynamism for the first decade mechanical art for the s aeroaesthetics for the s an example of futurist architecture by antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony

university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre currently there are active neofuturist troupes in chicago new york san francisco and montreal japanese composer ryuichi sakamotos  album futurista was inspired by the movement it

speed  sound – futurism is an avantgarde movement founded in milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas

haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in the s the art historian giovanni lista has classified futurism by decades plastic dynamism for the first decade mechanical art for the s aeroaesthetics for the s an example of futurist architecture by antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony

university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre currently there are active neofuturist troupes in chicago new york san francisco and montreal japanese composer ryuichi sakamotos  album futurista was inspired by the movement it

maluvenflickr in brief you may have never really thought about the environmental cost of feeding your pets pet food marketing is selling consumers unsustainable and unnecessary solutions for pet nutrition it is a  billion dollar industry that is taking a significant toll on the environment carbon pawprint pet food is an industry worth nearly us billion in the united states owners make decisions about what to feed their pets based on marketing personal beliefs and pet preference and as with human nutrition it can be hard to sort out truth from fads and marketing from science current pet food trends encourage owners to feed their pets much the same foods that humans eat highquality “human grade” meat and organic produce maybe even some “superfoods” while this approach is emotionally appealing it is not necessary for pets’ health nor is it environmentally sustainable pets can have a large ecological footprint and their food is a big contributing factor sustainable living experts robert and brenda vale suggest in their book “time to eat the dog the real guide to sustainable living” that a mediumsize dog could have a similar footprint to a large suv other experts have come to similar conclusions about the sustainability of feeding pets our clinical nutrition team at cummings school of veterinary medicine at tufts university recently published a pet food iq quiz written by three boardcertified veterinary nutritionists as the quiz demonstrates there are many myths about feeding pets and cats’ and dogs’ nutritional needs are different from human needs in some important ways by understanding these differences owners can keep their pets healthy while minimizing impacts on the environment it’s all about the meat making pet food takes a lot of animal protein and the current trend is to feed our pets highmeat diets typical dog foods contain  to  percent protein while cat foods range from  to  percent much of it from animal sources meatbased diets for humans and animals alike have much larger ecological footprints than plantbased diets because it takes lots of land water and food to feed pigs cows sheep poultry and farmed fish this may be your ideal but it’s not necessary for pets wwwshutterstockcom byproducts are sustainable and healthy for animals to consume the best way to feed our pets meatbased diets with minimal footprints is to use every part of the animals we slaughter for human food including organs these ingredients which do not include hair horns teeth or intestinal contents often collectively termed “byproducts” can be very goodquality sources of nutrients that pets enjoy while the pet food industry is well aware of this issue many companies persist in telling pet owners that byproducts should be avoided to make their own diets more appealing what’s good for humans isn’t always ideal or necessary for pets some manufacturers use the term “humangrade” to describe pet food or ingredients but the phrase has no legal meaning and does not necessarily connote anything about quality or nutritional value to be sold as food for humans a product must never leave the human food production chain while this requirement sounds good it adds unnecessary cost and may eliminate the use of many highquality sustainable ingredients that people normally don’t eat pets need goodquality food but they don’t have to compete for the same steak their owner is buying when they will happily and healthily eat organ meats or lesspretty trimmings cats and dogs can eat diets containing properly cooked grain and other plant ingredients contrary to many reports there are no documented health benefits to feeding pets a grainfree diet or one that avoids other plant ingredients according to a recent study one of the main genetic differences between dogs and wolves is that dogs have an increased ability to obtain nutrients from grains and other plants current grainfree diet trends are about selling pet food not about pet health and can lead to less sustainable diets but vegetarian and vegan diets aren’t always the best choices either although some human vegetarians and vegans choose their diets based on sustainability concerns as well as animal welfare dogs and especially cats generally do best with at least some animal products in their diets while eggs and dairy can be good options strict vegan diets may cause health problems for pets dogs are omnivores and more flexible but cats are true carnivores and have special nutrient needs that are hard to meet with plants alone thus cats should be fed diets that contain animal protein and other animalsourced nutrients one easy way to reduce the environmental impact of pet food is to use less of it obesity is a major problem for pets as well as for humans in the united states and the root cause of most weight gain is eating more calories than needed the bottom line is that choices about your pet’s diet can have implications for its health your wallet and the planet you can have both a healthy and more sustainable approach by feeding your dog or cat diets that contain moderate amounts of meat and use animal byproducts and feeding your pet only the amount of food it needs to maintain a healthy lean body weight cailin heinze assistant professor of nutrition cummings school of veterinary medicine tufts university this article was

originated in italy in the early th century it emphasized speed technology youth and violence and objects such as the car the aeroplane and the industrial city although it was largely an italian phenomenon there were parallel movements in russia england belgium and elsewhere the futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design urban design theatre film fashion textiles literature music architecture and even futurist meals its key figures were the italians filippo tommaso marinetti umberto boccioni carlo

avantgarde movement founded in milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas  x  cm gianni mattioli collection on longterm loan to the peggy guggenheim collection venice joseph stella battle of lights coney island  oil on canvas  ×  cm  ×  in yale university art gallery new haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in the s the art historian giovanni lista has classified futurism by decades plastic dynamism for the first decade mechanical art for the s aeroaesthetics for the s an example of futurist architecture by antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony

university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of

speed  sound – futurism is an avantgarde movement founded in milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas  x  cm gianni mattioli collection on longterm loan to the peggy guggenheim collection venice joseph stella battle of lights coney island  oil on canvas  ×  cm  ×  in yale university art gallery new haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in

antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony futurism in filmedit see also italian futurism cinema when interviewed about her favorite film of all times famed movie critic pauline kael stated that the director dimitri kirsanoff in his silent experimental film ménilmontant developed a technique that suggests the movement known in painting as futurism futurism in the s and sedit joseph stella  brooklyn bridge oil on canvas  x  cm yale university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre currently there are active neofuturist troupes in chicago new york san francisco and montreal japanese composer ryuichi sakamotos  album futurista was inspired by the movement it

its existence yet how likely is it that gravitons exist in modern physics matter in the universe is made up of quanta or “particles” such as electrons protons and neutrons these particles can be said to interact with and through various forces or fields strong weak electromagnetic gravitational for which there are corresponding “field quanta” such as photons and gluons these quanta are often seen as the particles that make up these fields and while things are a bit more complicated it is the right basic idea we have a lot of experimental evidence for these quanta but there is one that’s often mentioned for which we have no experimental evidence that’s the graviton image credit mark garlick  spl one of the basic ways to start in quantum field theory is with a waveform that you can then “quantize” using the mathematical formalism in this way you can show for example how photons arise from the electromagnetic field the same thing can be done with the gravitational field start with gravitational waves and then quantize it to derive gravitons but there are some problems with this approach in quantum field theory all fields act within a flat background of space and time what we call minkowski space gravitational waves distort space and time itself so to derive gravitons it’s often assumed that the gravitational waves are a fluctuation within a background of minkowski space it this way you can treat gravity as a field within flat space in order to quantize it of course general relativity shows that’s not how gravity works gravity is a product of spacetime curvature so to quantize gravity you’d need to quantize spacetime itself just how that might be done is one of the great unsolved problems in physics so it’s possible that gravitons don’t exist but it’s generally thought that they do since most physicists think that in the end quantum theory is at the heart of everything the current main approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity predict the existence of gravitons with the same properties we see in the simple “quantized wave” approach known particles and field quanta image credit aaas even if gravitons exist it’s likely that we’d never be able to detect them as one recent paper demonstrated gravitons would interact so weakly with masses that you’d need something like a jupitermass detector orbiting a neutron star even then it would take more than a decade to detect a single graviton and still the noise from things like neutrinos would wash out your signal if there’s no practical way to detect gravitons does it make sense to talk of them as a scientific model perhaps assuming they remain within a robust model of quantum gravity there may be indirect ways of confirming their existence for now however they are purely hypothetical     provided by brian koberlein at one universe at a time paper rothman t and boughn s can gravitons be detected foundations of physics   –  references arxiv

milan in  by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinetti marinetti launched the movement in his futurist manifesto which he published for the first time on  february  in la gazzetta dellemilia an article then reproduced in the french daily newspaper le figaro on saturday  february  he was soon joined by the painters umberto boccioni carlo carrà giacomo balla gino severini and the composer luigi russolo marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition we want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong futurists the futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists they repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science publishing manifestos was a feature of futurism and the futurists usually led or prompted by marinetti wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme which the futurists attempted to create in their subsequent technical manifesto of futurist painting  this committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings the sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one ten four three they are motionless and they change places  the motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it the futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter in  and  they used the techniques of divisionism breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes which had been originally created by giovanni segantini and others later severini who lived in paris attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from paris the centre of avantgarde art severini was the first to come into contact with cubism and following a visit to paris in  the futurist painters adopted the methods of the cubists cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism umberto boccioni sketch of the city rises  they often painted modern urban scenes carràs funeral of the anarchist galli – is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in in  the action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes his leaving the theatre – uses a divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights boccionis the city rises  represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge rearing red horse in the centre foreground which workmen struggle to control his states of mind in three large panels the farewell those who go and those who stay made his first great statement of futurist painting bringing his interests in bergson cubism and the individuals complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the minor masterpieces of early twentieth century painting the work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time using new means of expression including lines of force which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space simultaneity which combined memories present impressions and anticipation of future events and emotional ambience in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion boccionis intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of bergson including the idea of intuition which bergson defined as a simple indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it the futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book pittura scultura futuriste dinamismo plastico futurist painting sculpture plastic dynamism  giacomo balla  dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio dynamism of a dog on a leash albrightknox art gallery ballas dynamism of a dog on a leash  exemplifies the futurists insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement the painting depicts a dog whose legs tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement it illustrates the precepts of the technical manifesto of futurist painting that on account of the persistency of an image upon the retina moving objects constantly multiply themselves their form changes like rapid vibrations in their mad career thus a running horse has not four legs but twenty and their movements are triangular his rhythm of the bow  similarly depicts the movements of a violinists hand and instrument rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame the adoption of cubism determined the style of much subsequent futurist painting which boccioni and severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brushstrokes of divisionism but futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static cubism of picasso braque and gris although there were futurist portraits eg carràs woman with absinthe  severinis selfportrait  and boccionis matter  it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified futurist painting—eg boccionis the street enters the house  severinis dynamic hieroglyph of the bal tabarin  and russolos automobile at speed  umberto boccioni  dynamism of a cyclist dinamismo di un ciclista oil on canvas  x  cm gianni mattioli collection on longterm loan to the peggy guggenheim collection venice joseph stella battle of lights coney island  oil on canvas  ×  cm  ×  in yale university art gallery new haven ct in  and  boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his futurist ideas in unique forms of continuity in space  he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment which was central to his theory of dynamism the sculpture represents a striding figure cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the tate modern it now appears on the national side of italian  eurocent coins he explored the theme further in synthesis of human dynamism  speeding muscles  and spiral expansion of speeding muscles  his ideas on sculpture were published in the technical manifesto of futurist sculpture in  balla also turned to sculpture making abstract reconstructions which were created out of various materials were apparently moveable and even made noises he said that after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles he understood that the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth  i felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires cardboard planes cloth and tissue paper etc in  personal quarrels and artistic differences between the milan group around marinetti boccioni and balla and the florence group around carrà ardengo soffici – and giovanni papini – created a rift in italian futurism the florence group resented the dominance of marinetti and boccioni whom they accused of trying to establish an immobile church with an infallible creed and each group dismissed the other as passéiste umberto boccioni unique forms of continuity in space  umberto boccioni  elasticity elasticità oil on canvas  x  cm museo del novecento futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic the futurist manifesto had declared we will glorify war —the worlds only hygiene —militarism patriotism the destructive gesture of freedombringers beautiful ideas worth dying for and scorn for woman although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of  then fearing the reelection of giolitti marinetti published a political manifesto in  the futurists began to campaign actively against the austrohungarian empire which still controlled some italian territories and italian neutrality between the major powers in september boccioni seated in the balcony of the teatro dal verme in milan tore up an austrian flag and threw it into the audience while marinetti waved an italian flag when italy entered the first world war in  many futurists enlisted the experience of the war marked several futurists particularly marinetti who fought in the mountains of trentino at the border of italy and austriahungary actively engaging in propaganda the combat experience also influenced futurist music the outbreak of war disguised the fact that italian futurism had come to an end the florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of  boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in  severini painted some significant war pictures in  eg war armored train and red cross train but in paris turned towards cubism and postwar was associated with the return to order after the war marinetti revived the movement this revival was called il secondo futurismo second futurism by writers in the s the art historian giovanni lista has classified futurism by decades plastic dynamism for the first decade mechanical art for the s aeroaesthetics for the s an example of futurist architecture by antonio santelia futurist architectureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  further information futurist architecture the futurist architect antonio santelia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for la città nuova the new city – this project was never built and santelia was killed in the first world war but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artistscitation needed the city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of futurist life is projected the city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life santelia aimed to create a city as an efficient fastpaced machine he manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity in the new city every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy the city was not meant to last and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the fascist states tendency towards roman imperialclassical aesthetic patterns nevertheless several futurist buildings were built in the years – including public buildings such as railway stations maritime resorts and post offices examples of futurist buildings still in use today are trentos railway station built by angiolo mazzoni and the santa maria novella station in florence the florence station was designed in  by the gruppo toscano tuscan group of architects which included giovanni michelucci and italo gamberini with contributions by mazzonicitation needed russian futurismedit main articles russian futurism and cubofuturism natalia goncharova cyclist  russian futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts the poet vladimir mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement visual artists such as david burlyuk mikhail larionov natalia goncharova and kazimir malevich found inspiration in the imagery of futurist writings and were poets themselves it has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement other poets adopting futurism included velimir khlebnikov and aleksey kruchenykh poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the futurist opera victory over the sun with texts by kruchenykh and sets by malevich the main style of painting was cubofuturism adopted in  when aristarkh lentulov returned from paris and exhibited his paintings in moscow cubofuturism combines the forms of cubism with the representation of movement like their italian predecessors the russian futurists were fascinated with dynamism speed and the restlessness of modern urban life the russian futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past saying that pushkin and dostoevsky should be heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity they acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to marinetti whose principles they had earlier adopted obstructing him when he came to russia to proselytize in  the movement began to decline after the revolution of  some futurists died others emigrated mayakovsky and malevich became part of the soviet establishment and the agitprop movement of the s khlebnikov and others were persecuted mayakovsky committed suicide on april   futurism in musicedit main article futurism music futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery and would influence several thcentury composers francesco balilla pratella joined the futurist movement in  and wrote a manifesto of futurist musicians in which he appealed to the young as had marinetti because only they could understand what he had to say according to pratella italian music was inferior to music abroad he praised the sublime genius of wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers for example richard strauss elgar mussorgsky and sibelius by contrast the italian symphony was dominated by opera in an absurd and antimusical form the conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity the publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the rickety and vulgar operas of puccini and umberto giordano the only italian pratella could praise was his teacher pietro mascagni because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera but even mascagni was too traditional for pratellas tastes in the face of this mediocrity and conservatism pratella unfurled the red flag of futurism calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight minds to conceive and brows free of cowardice luigi russolo – wrote the art of noises  an influential text in thcentury musical aesthetics russolo used instruments he called intonarumori which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises russolo and marinetti gave the first concert of futurist music complete with intonarumori in  however they were prevented from performing in many major european cities by the outbreak of war futurism was one of several thcentury movements in art music that paid homage to included or imitated machines ferruccio busoni has been seen as anticipating some futurist ideas though he remained wedded to tradition russolos intonarumori influenced stravinsky arthur honegger george antheil edgar varèse stockhausen and john cagecitation needed in pacific  honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive there are also futurist elements in prokofievs the steel step and in his second symphony most notable in this respect however is the american george antheil his fascination with machinery is evident in his airplane sonata death of the machines and the minute ballet mécanique the ballet mécanique was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by fernand léger but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone the score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones four bass drums a tamtam three airplane propellers seven electric bells a siren two live pianists and sixteen synchronized player pianos antheils piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play other composers offered more melodic variants of futurist music notably franco casavola who was active with the movement at the invitation of marinetti between  and  and arthurvincent lourié the first russian futurist musician and a signatory of the st petersburg futurist manifesto in  his five synthèses offer a form of dodecaphony while formes en lair was dedicated to picasso and is a cubofuturist concept born in ukraine and raised in new york leo ornstein gave his first recital of futurist music at the steinway hall in london on  march  according to the daily sketch newspaper one listened with considerable distress nothing so horrible as mr ornsteins music has been heard so far sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital futurism in danceedit the futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance indeed dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing mans ultimate fusion with the machine the altitude of a flying plane the power of a cars motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of mans intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise this type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional classical dance and introduces a different style new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience the dancer no longer performs a story a clear content that can be read according to the rules of ballet one of the most famous futuristic dancers was the italian giannina censi it trained as a classical ballerina she is known for her aerodanze and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions she describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with marinetti and his poetry through these words she explains  i launched this idea of the aerialfuturist poetry with marinetti he himself declaiming the poetry a small stage of a few square meters i made myself a satin costume with a helmet everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body it flew and moreover it gave the impression of these wings that trembled of the apparatus that trembled and the face had to express what the pilot felt futurism in literatureedit main article futurism literature futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with ft marinettis manifesto of futurism  as it delineated the various ideals futurist poetry should strive for poetry the predominate medium of futurist literature can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyperconciseness not to be confused with the actual length of the poem the futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà word autonomy in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern in this way the futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation and metrics that allowed for free expression theater also has an important place within the futurist universe works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long have an emphasis on nonsensical humor and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques there are a number of examples of futurist novels from both the initial period of futurism and the neofuturist period from marinetti himself to a number of lesser known futurists such as primo conti ardengo soffici and giordano bruno sanzin zig zag il romanzo futurista edited by alessandro masi  they are very diverse in style with very little recourse to the characteristics of futurist poetry such as parole in libertà arnaldo ginnas le locomotive con le calzetrains with socks onplunges into a world of absurd nonsense childishly crude his brother bruno corra wrote in sam dunn è morto sam dunn is dead a masterpiece of futurist fiction in a genre he himself called synthetic characterized by compression and precision it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony futurism in filmedit see also italian futurism cinema when

suggests the movement known in painting as futurism futurism in the s and sedit joseph stella  brooklyn bridge oil on canvas  x  cm yale university art gallery the cover of the last edition of blast the literary magazine of the british vorticist movement a movement heavily influenced by futurism many italian futurists supported fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural archaic south like the fascists the futurists were italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy marinetti founded the futurist political party partito politico futurista in early  which was absorbed into benito mussolinis fasci di combattimento in  making marinetti one of the first members of the national fascist party he opposed fascisms later exaltation of existing institutions calling them reactionary and walked out of the  fascist party congress in disgust withdrawing from politics for three years but he supported italian fascism until his death in  the futurists association with fascism after its triumph in  brought them official acceptance in italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture after the second world war many futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime marinetti sought to make futurism the official state art of fascist italy but failed to do so mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime opening the exhibition of art by the novecento italiano group in  he said i declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art art belongs to the domain of the individual the state has only one duty not to undermine art to provide humane conditions for artists to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view mussolinis mistress margherita sarfatti who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as marinetti successfully promoted the rival novecento group and even persuaded marinetti to sit on its board although in the early years of italian fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced towards the end of the s rightwing fascists introduced the concept of degenerate art from germany to italy and condemned futurism marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime becoming less radical and avantgarde with each he moved from milan to rome to be nearer the centre of things he became an academician despite his condemnation of academies married despite his condemnation of marriage promoted religious art after the lateran treaty of  and even reconciled himself to the catholic church declaring that jesus was a futurist although futurism became identified with fascism it had leftist and antifascist supporters they tended to oppose marinettis artistic and political direction of the movement and in  the socialists communists and anarchists walked out of the milan futurist congress the antifascist voices in futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of abyssinia and the italogerman pact of steel in  this association of fascists socialists and anarchists in the futurist movement which may seem odd today can be understood in terms of the influence of georges sorel whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre design textiles drama literature music and architecture aeropaintingedit main article aeropittura aeropainting aeropittura was a major expression of the second generation of futurism beginning in  the technology and excitement of flight directly experienced by most aeropainters offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment including realism especially in works of propaganda abstraction dynamism quiet umbrian landscapes portraits of mussolini eg dottoris portrait of il duce devotional religious paintings decorative art and pictures of planes aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of  perspectives of flight signed by benedetta depero dottori fillìa marinetti prampolini somenzi and tato guglielmo sansoni the artists stated that the changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective and that painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything crispolti identifies three main positions in aeropainting a vision of cosmic projection at its most typical in prampolinis cosmic idealism   a reverie of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairytale for example in dottori  and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery particularly in crali but also in tato and ambrosi eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters major figures include fortunato depero enrico prampolini gerardo dottori and crali crali continued to produce aeropittura up until the s the legacy of futurismedit futurism influenced many other twentiethcentury art movements including art deco vorticism constructivism surrealism dada and much later neofuturism futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct having died out in  with the death of its leader marinetti nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture ridley scott consciously evoked the designs of santelia in blade runnercitation needed echoes of marinettis thought especially his dreamtof metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as shinya tsukamoto director of the tetsuo lit ironman films futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the internet such as stelarc and mariko mori produce work which comments on futurist idealscitation needed and the art and architecture movement neofuturism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values a revival of sorts of the futurist movement in theatre began in  with the creation of the neofuturist style in chicago which utilizes futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre currently there are active neofuturist troupes in chicago new york san
