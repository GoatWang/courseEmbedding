effect as if the business combination as defined below had occurred as of january   the pro forma adjustments are based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect on a pro forma basis the impact of these transactions on the historical financial information of our predecessor entity on november   the “closing date” in a transaction referred to as the “business combination” the company then known as gores holdings inc acquired a controlling interest in hostess holdings lp “hostess holdings” an entity owned indirectly by c dean metropoulos and certain equity funds managed by affiliates of apollo global management llc the “apollo funds” hostess holdings had acquired the hostess brand and certain strategic assets out of the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of its prior owner “old hostess” free and clear of all past liabilities in april  and relaunched the hostess brand later that year the business combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting the initial estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the closing date which are based on the consideration paid and estimates and our assumptions are reflected herein the total purchase price of approximately  billion to acquire hostess holdings has been allocated to the assets acquired and assumed liabilities of hostess holdings based upon estimated fair values at the date of acquisition third party valuation specialists conducted analyses in order to assist our management in determining the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed the company has estimated the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition the unaudited pro forma

in may  the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the three months ended march   does not include the results of the superior acquisition and its related operations we evaluated the impact of the superior acquisition on the company’s financial statements and concluded that the impact was not significant and did not require nor separately warrant the inclusion of pro forma

and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity each as determined in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the company has included adjusted ebitda because it believes it provides management and investors with additional information to measure the companys performance and liquidity estimate the companys value and evaluate the companys ability to service debt we define adjusted ebitda as net income adjusted to exclude i interest expense net ii depreciation and amortization and iii income taxes and iv as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance these further adjustments are itemized below you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future the company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below the companys presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items adjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the companys results as reported under gaap for example adjusted ebitda does not reflect the companys capital expenditures future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the companys working capital needs does not reflect the significant interest expenses or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the companys debt does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future and does not reflect payments related to income taxes the tax receivable agreement or distributions to the noncontrolling interest to reimburse its tax liability the companys presentation of adjusted ebitda does not exclude the normal annual cash payments associated with its employment agreement with mr metropoulos as the chief executive officer andor executive chairman these amounts were  million for the three months ended march   and  million for the three months ended march

insurance taxes and maintenance expenses related to the schiller park illinois bakery       reconciliation of adjusted ebitdaguidance for the year ended december   reconciliation of our  adjusted ebitda guidance to net income presents inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that are necessary for a full reconciliation to net income our outlook for  adjusted ebitda is based on the same methodology used to present adjusted ebitda for completed historical and pro forma periods however the amounts if any of the nonrecurring items that are excluded from adjusted ebitda are highly uncertain and incapable of estimation and have not been included in the table above such nonrecurring items may include noncash expenses for earn out liabilities under the terms of the business combination noncash expense relating to the tax receivable agreement andor other items as such items are excluded from adjusted ebitda the occurrence and magnitude thereof while impacting net income and the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income would have no impact on adjusted ebitda for  in addition the below reconciliation assumes that the overall capital structure of the company and effective income tax rates are consistent with the structure at march   changes to these assumptions could significantly impact our net income for  and accordingly the reconciliation of adjusted

information of our predecessor entityon november   the “closing date” in a transaction referred to as the “business combination” the company then known as gores holdings inc acquired a controlling interest in hostess holdings lp “hostess holdings” an entity owned indirectly by c dean metropoulos and certain equity funds managed by affiliates of apollo global management llc the “apollo funds” hostess holdings had acquired the hostess brand and certain strategic assets out of the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of its prior owner “old hostess” free and clear of all past liabilities in april  and relaunched the hostess brand later that yearthe business combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting the initial estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the closing date which are based on the consideration paid and estimates and our assumptions are reflected herein the total purchase price of approximately  billion to acquire hostess holdings has been allocated to the assets acquired and assumed liabilities of hostess holdings based upon estimated fair values at the date of acquisition third party valuation

ebitdaadjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure commonly used in the companys industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity each as determined in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the company has included adjusted ebitda because it believes it provides management and investors with additional information to measure the companys performance and liquidity estimate the companys value and evaluate the companys ability to service debtwe define adjusted ebitda as net income adjusted to exclude i interest expense net ii depreciation and amortization and iii income taxes and iv as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance these further adjustments are itemized below you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future the company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below the companys presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring itemsadjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the companys results as reported under gaap for example adjusted ebitda does not reflect the companys capital expenditures future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the companys working capital needs does not reflect the significant interest expenses or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the companys debt does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future and does not reflect payments related to income taxes the tax receivable agreement or distributions to the noncontrolling interest to reimburse its tax liability the companys presentation of adjusted ebitda does not exclude the normal annual cash payments associated with its employment agreement with mr metropoulos as the chief executive officer andor executive chairman these amounts were  million for the three months ended march   and  million for the three months ended march   following completion of the business combination these expenses will be approximately

reconciliation of adjusted ebitdaguidance for the year ended december  reconciliation of our  adjusted ebitda guidance to net income presents inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that are necessary for a full reconciliation to net income our outlook for  adjusted ebitda is based on the same methodology used to present adjusted ebitda for completed historical and pro forma periods however the amounts if any of the nonrecurring items that are excluded from adjusted ebitda are highly uncertain and incapable of estimation and have not been included in the table above such nonrecurring items may include noncash expenses for earn out liabilities under the terms of the business combination noncash expense relating to the tax receivable agreement andor other items as such items are excluded from adjusted ebitda the occurrence and magnitude thereof while impacting net income and the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income would have no impact on adjusted ebitda for  in addition the below reconciliation assumes that the overall capital structure of the company and effective income tax rates are consistent with the structure at march   changes to these assumptions could significantly impact our net income for  and accordingly the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income but not adjusted ebitda itself for additional information regarding our

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
