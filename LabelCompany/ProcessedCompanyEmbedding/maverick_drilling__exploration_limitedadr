of maverick shares just under a year ago having pocketed huge gains on the way up luck’s a fortune although maverick shares are down and out today there is cause for hope here are three reasons…  management new ceo and chairman j michael yeager is the exchief executive of the bhp billiton limited asx bhp petroleum division he would have gone into this role with his eyes wide open presumably confident he could turn the company’s reported massive oil reserves into meaningful and exciting levels of oil production  on the same management theme mr yeager is building a full exploration and production management team “capable of managing multiple assets” key appointments have already been made with the company looking to add staff in the areas of reservoir engineering geoscience and land management  time maverick is a company in transition it is now focusing on improving blue ridge to a cash positive asset building the management team and screening for new growth opportunities but it will take time something an impatient stock market usually doesn’t afford a former market darling an investment in maverick is an investment in mr yeager — you are effectively betting on his

maverick drilling and exploration ltd asx mad has seen its shares fall more than  today to as low as  cents after the company announced some major changes including how it reports oil reserves oil reserves slashed in the past maverick had touted that it had more than  million barrels of oil in reserves – worth more than us billion at current oil prices – but new ceo mike yeager has dramatically slashed that to  million barrels from its blue ridge field and a further update could see reserves cut even lower mr yeager was previously bhp billiton limited’s asx bhp petroleum boss so has plenty of experience behind him going forward the company will exclude any proved reserves at its boling and nash fields which last reported  million barrels in reserves in  that will surely cast doubt over the validity of the company’s oil reserves at all three of its fields it was one of the major concerns we had with the company – whether the reserves were credible  – and it’s one reason why we advised motley fool share advisor members to sell maverick in may  when the price was around  cents asset sales coming mr yaeger has also announced a new focus for the company and acreage that would not be drilled for many years will be released as the lease terms expire reviews of the boling field suggest the company could better spend its money elsewhere and it could be offloaded in the near future a similar analysis is taking place at the nash field over the next six months given recent asset sales in some of the us shale regions maverick could realise significant value from the sale of its assets companies like sundance energy limited asx sea awe limited asx awe and red fork energy limited asx rfe could also be sitting on valuable assets with substantial acreages in us shales the new maverick most of the old senior management have left including joint ceos don henrich and brad simmons and yaeger has installed virtually a whole new management team at the top the ‘new’ maverick is already looking like a completely different company but it will likely take some time to turn around its financial performance a much better bet than maverick its tempting to take a punt on
