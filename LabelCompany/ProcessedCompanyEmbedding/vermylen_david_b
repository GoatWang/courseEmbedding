to the chairman and ceo of treehouse foods mr sam k reed please go ahead sir sam k reed thank you jill good afternoon everyone and welcome back to our treehouse david vermylen dennis riordan and i have great news and substantial progress to report we have completed another quarter of strong top line sales increases sequential margin expansion an acquisition fueled earnings growth these results speak not only of our financial discipline during turbulent times but also our dedication to a superior go to market strategy that is right for these times highlights for the third quarter include revenue growth before acquisitions of  the best of the year driven by unit volume increases in strategically attractive categories accelerated pricing to recover higher input costs and favorable private label trends in the retail grocery industry double digit sales growth from ed smith and san antonio farms coupled with operating synergies as these  acquisitions expanded their distribution through the treehouse sales and marketing network while enjoying the economies and scale of our supply chain prudent management of our financial resources and balance sheet as is especially befitting times of economic distress and uncertainty that we could increase quarterly cash flow by  million versus last year while preparing for the year ending seasonal peaks in soup and nondairy creamer shipments is clear testimony to our relentless focus on operational excellence productivity and procurement based cost reduction programs and skillful tax and treasury management and finally record ebitda of  million an increase of  as we slowly but surely recovered gross margin dollars lost in the commodity and energy bubble of the first half of the year although below q of last year margins gained sequentially on a quarter by quarter basis as realized price increases exceeded an annualized  million closely approximating forecast input cost inflation for the year while we are playing catch up south of the border our canadian acquisition posted a solid  basis point gain in adjusted gross margin during the quarter we now enter the fourth quarter our seasonally strongest while an innate sense of caution requires that we curb our enthusiasm we face the end of this year and the beginning of next with high confidence our principle problems the built in lag in pricing to recovering input costs inflation and falling demand in food away from home are matched with even greater opportunities the high growth potential of our value oriented retail grocery portfolio and the benefits derived from strategically sound acquisitions david and dennis will now guide you through the particulars of market conditions our go to market strategy recent performance and the outlook for the remainder of  david david b vermylen thank you sam and good afternoon everyone today i will focus on four areas first a refresher on our product portfolio’s strategy though our business results can be viewed from a strategic perspective second the top line performance of the business third commodity costs and pricing and how they will affect the business both short and long term and fourth an update on the private label market first as we have discussed on prior calls with our rapidly growing product line our portfolio strategy is the tool we use to manage the business while we are focused on top line growth we are more focused on the quality of revenue the quality of revenue principally determined by eda analysis the return on capital employed this summer we updated our eda analysis including all of our  acquisitions to give us a clear path to follow products such as nondairy creamer condensed soup salad dressing salsa marinades and sauces are all high priority businesses on our keys to our growth on the other hand much of the pickle business the branded infant feeding business along with some smaller product categories are not key to our growth and are being managed accordingly our third quarter top line results reflect continued execution of that portfolio’s strategy total revenue was up  due in large part to the addition of ed smith importantly nonacquisition revenue grew almost  this compares to  in the second quarter i’ll start with north american retail grocery total revenue was up  primarily due to the addition of ed smith excluding ed smith nonacquisition revenue was up  from a portfolio strategy perspective we had double digit revenue growth in nondairy creamer soup and salsa that growth more than offset expected declines in pickles due to planned low margin customer rationalization and the loss of a large infant feeding customer late last year not in our base growth number is the  growth we had in salad dressings and marinades along with salsa we are getting great growth from our  acquisitions and are developing a great portfolio of retail categories regarding ed smith today we announced the pending closing of our cambridge ontario salad dressing plant and the consolidation of its manufacturing into our two other salad dressing facilities we are expanding capacity in our us plant which is a more efficient facility thus we’ll be able to support continued salad dressing and marinade growth with improved margins ed smith continues to surpass all of our going in targets and is firing on all cylinders when it comes to top line and margin performance food away from home had a good quarter despite the severe affect the economy is having on out of home eating especially the casual dining segment total revenue was up  due to the addition of ed smith with base revenue up  due to pricing and very strong salsa growth as we brought on new food service customers our industrial and export business had a solid quarter with revenue up  due to higher copack volume and ingredient pricing the top line summary for the third quarter is as follows good solid revenue growth from the legacy business particularly as it relates to the execution of our portfolio strategy and excellent growth postintegration from our  acquisitions of san antonio farms and ed smith for the fourth quarter we are cautiously optimistic the soup and nondairy creamer seasons are just beginning and cool weather has taken hold now let me turn to commodity costs and pricing while we are very pleased to see commodity and energy costs come off their july highs it’ll have very little affect on us this year as we covered the majority of our  costs in the second quarter in order to finalize second half pricing plans in the fourth quarter we will have some energy benefits as it relates to freight but the benefits will be marginal while our margins improve versus the second quarter they are still below year ago as we look at next year while we should see a decline in vegetable oil pricing versus our average buy in  we expect to see pretty large increases in metal cans corn sweeteners fruits and vegetables corn sweeteners initial quoted pricing from key suppliers is up  to  in total we expected our average input costs in ’ will be up in the low to mid single digits versus double digit growth in  while we have taken some first half ’ commodity coverage on a couple of key inputs the current volatility in the market has us meeting daily to gauge the right time to move in more aggressively strategically our goal entering  will be to have more coverage in place than when we entered  in order to reduce the volatility we experienced in  we have not had any pushback on our current pricing due to the recent commodity bear market except in terms of some pricing we plan to take in the fourth quarter if there is pushback we are fully prepared to review customer by customer where costs were three years ago where they are today and how our pricing compares to those costs our goal is to begin to recapture lost margin but we do not expect a margin windfall as we operate in a very competitive environment in our industrial business where we have some costs passed through contracts we will adjust prices next year but not at the expense of profitability now let me turn to the private label market on our last call i said that in the second quarter we were just beginning to see an acceleration in private label growth above the normal growth experienced over the last few years that acceleration picked up in the third quarter a nielsen analysis of  categories indicated that for the  weeks ending october  private label had aggregate volume growth of  compared to  in the second quarter that is a very healthy growth rate within measured channels excluding infant feeding and our rationalized pickle customers our us retail volume growth was comparable to the private label market as measured by nielsen most categories showed private label share gains and that held true for all of our key categories and our share gains came with our price differentials to the brand generally consistent with last year on a penny per unit basis now let me comment on one major initiative that took place in the third quarter that will have a negative effect on margins in the fourth quarter but it was a great move for the business the initiative relates to inventory management input cost inflation has a significant effect on the costs of inventory and return on capital even if your inventory is flat in terms of cases it could be up  in dollars yearoveryear earlier this year we did some inventory and customer service modeling that indicated we could operate with lower inventories across many of our key businesses rather than reducing them over an extended period back in may a task force led by dennis put in place an ambitious inventory reduction program that led to our legacy business inventory declining in units by  versus september   yet we did it without sacrificing customer service levels typically we are a user of cash in the third quarter as we build soup pickle and powder inventory in his comments dennis will review how that changed this year i’ll now turn it over to dennis dennis f riordan thank you david since david covered the revenue growth i will focus on other key aspects of our operating results including gross margin improvement controlled expenses and financing activities first overall gross margins in the quarter were  compared to  last year a decrease of  basis points as a combination of high embedded input costs along with higher transportation costs were not fully recovered in the quarter from pricing actions this has been a consistent story all year however we did see an improvement on a sequential basis from last quarter’s gross margins of  as pricing was more fully realized in the quarter margin improvement from the second quarter was realized in nearly every product category in channel with the exception of our food away from home business where lower volumes and a difficult economic environment caused a consumer shift towards food at home rather than meals away in regard to operating expenses selling distribution general and administrative expenses increased from  million in  to  million in the third quarter of  due to the overall growth in the company as a percent of sales sga costs finished the quarter at  compared to  in last year’s third quarter as we realized synergies from the businesses acquired in  partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in noncash amortization expense the increase in amortization expense from  million in  to  million in  was due to an increase of amortizable intangible assets such as trademarks trade names and customer lists associated with the ed smith acquisition in  our other operating expenses totaled  nearly all of that being shutdown costs associated with the previously announced closing of our portland oregon pickle plant interest expense increased from  million in  to  million in  due to additional bank borrowings used for acquisitions used in  however interest expense was inaudible on a sequential basis from last quarter due to an aggressive program to reduce working capital and generate additional cash flow these programs were successful in driving down our finished goods inventory units and businesses by  compared to september   we were also able to improve our already low days sales outstanding ratio to  days at the end of the quarter these working capital plans resulted in significant positive cash flow in the quarter even though we historically have negative cash flow in the third quarter the third quarter was the seasonal build period for soup nondairy creamer and reserves of cucumbers for winter processing however this year we actually reduced outstanding debt in the quarter by nearly  million to  million at september  this compares to last year’s third quarter when inventories rose and our outstanding debt increased by  million this change is debt is the free cash flow of  million sam referred to earlier in light of the volatile interest rate environment we have also been very focused on treasury management as many of you know we have two primary sources of funds senior notes that carry a coupon rate of  and a revolving credit agreement that has a variable rate based on libor plus a credit spread we were very successful at managing interest rates this year as evidenced by the all in interest costs on over  million in revolving debt of only  in the second quarter although rates have been erratic in the third quarter our average borrowing rate in the third quarter was only  to help insure we minimize our exposure to significant swings in interest rates in the future we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement that will be effective beginning november   under this swap we will have a fixed libor base rate of  for two years on  million in principal the swap agreement will then amortize down to  million also at  interest for an additional nine months this will coincide with the expiration of our current revolving credit agreement this swap agreement will result in us having a maximum interest rate of  on the underlying principal based on our maximum credit spread of  basis points this maximum credit spread can decrease as our debt levels decrease we believe this very advantageous agreement will allow us to continue to take advantage of short term rate opportunities on a portion of our debt to lock in a very low fixed rate on the majority of our revolving debt regarding taxes our effective tax rate for the quarter was  compared to  last year the much lower tax rate was due to canadian sourced income that carries a much lower effective tax rate along with the deductible interest loss on a canadian intercompany note this quarter’s tax rate is consistent with the yeartodate rate of  reported net income finished at  per share compared to  per share last year however we did have three unusual items in the quarter first we had additional costs associated with the closed portland plant that lowered net income by about  per share in the quarter second we had integration costs of  associated with the integration of the us based ed smith operations indoor bay valley foods operating company and finally we had a noncash revaluation loss on the intercompany note of approximately  per share after adjusting for these three one time items our adjusted earnings per share would have been  per share this is a  improvement compared to last year’s third quarter of  per share to recap the third quarter we began to see improvements in our gross margins as price increases were more fully realized and softening in the energy markets started to take some pressure off key inputs we also saw very nice unit sales growth in most of our product categories finally we took aggressive actions to better manage our working capital and derive incremental cash flow in regard to the balance of the year outlook we are now in the key soup and nondairy creamer shipping season and will see seasonal growth in our top line in the fourth quarter in addition we expect to see continued standard gross margin improvement in the business but those improved margins will be offset by higher one time unfavorable factory variances associated with the third quarter inventory reduction program those unfavorable production variances will roll into the fourth quarter results we estimate these nonrecurring variances will have a negative effect on the fourth quarter results of  per share excluding these one time variances adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be  to  bringing the full year adjusted earnings per share to a range of  to  sam i will now turn it back to you sam k reed thanks dennis last february in what now seems to be an entirely different world we set forth six critical elements for the treehouse plans for  these included number one protect margins number two grow the base number three reform our supply chain number four strengthen our platform number five change with the times and number six reaffirm our commitment nine months later via the world being turned on its head we can report that even under the most hostile and volatile market conditions we have made substantial progress on all of these strategic fronts importantly we also exceeded our original financial expectations even after commodity and energy inflation across the packaged goods industry was almost triple that of preceding years next our portfolio product categories marketed across three business units has been strategically strengthened by the additional salsa and salad dressing as well as access to the canadian market lastly our infrastructure be it our supply chain or balance sheet has shown great resiliency and adapted well to these new and difficult times as the new year dawns we see  as a year of great promise for treehouse specifically the economy while weak in general will favor those who can deliver great value to consumers and superior service including affordable innovation to customers input inflation will slow to low single digits allowing us to close the remaining price cost gap caused by the ladies and gentlemen following the commodity and oil bubble pressure for price rollbacks should narrowly focus on only certain product categories not the entire portfolio next eva analysis and portfolio strategy will lead us to real growth better margins and competitive advantage as we invest in the strong and winnow the weak it is worthy of note that our present portfolio is far more weighted toward growth categories whether large or small than our original legacy base internal improvement will enhance our margins through productivity procurement and innovation our supply chain will benefit from consolidation of under utilized manufacturing capacity as well as the expansion of our distribution network lastly external expansion will allow us to enlarge and upgrade treehouse portfolio by the addition of new growth opportunities sellers will again return to the ma marketplace as uncertainty and volatility recede and more financing although with less leverage becomes available treehouse reputation for strategic expansion certainty of closing adroit integration and prudent cash management will stand us in good stead far ahead of our competition for acquisitions when the economy and capital markets inevitably turn for the better in summary while we must continue to confront operational issues and cope with significant risks in the marketplace we at treehouse are confident of our future and the outlook not only for the remainder of this year but more importantly the next jill we will now open the phone lines for questions and comments questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey can you talk a little bit i guess on the price increases versus the commodity cost increases going into next year do you expect gross margins to get back to the levels of a couple years ago will they be up yearoveryear how are you looking at it from that standpoint david b vermylen i think they’ll be – we haven’t completed all of our planning for next year but we believe we’ll continue to see this sequential improvement as we have had over the last few quarters now we’d love to get back to where we were a couple of years ago but know that we’re not going to be able to get there in one fell swoop but we will make meaningful progress bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey in terms of acquisitions it sounds like it’s been pushed from the end of this year to the first part of next year with financing with credit markets with what have you do you see something in the first half of next year or is it probably pushed to the second half sam k reed i won’t comment on a particular timing or a specific category but what we do see is that on an internal basis we have reached that point where we are fully capable of taking on another large scale and strategically meaningful acquisition we’ve got a number of candidates in mind and our focus on less on the matter of exact timing than in fact the strategic value of what it is that we see bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey just on a go forward basis what are you projecting i mean should we project  tax rate and similar in terms of currency impact on maybe the fourth quarter results dennis f riordan yes i think at this point the based on the full year rate coming in at just about  i think that’s a fair assumption for q on the exchange rates boy i wish i knew we went from what  to  in about twoandahalf weeks and then back up to   so i think we’re just going to be watching it like everybody else bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey but just on your full year eps you’re assuming a similar type charge in the fourth quarter sort of like we saw in the third sam k reed on an excluded basis that doesn’t impact things we don’t have a guidance with the potential for the intercompany debt because that’s noncash bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey were there any additional i guess customer wins for ed smith this quarter david b vermylen we have had – again i’m concerned about commenting on specific customer wins because it really relates to then our relationship with the customer and revealing that kind of information i can tell you that with both ed smith and san antonio farms we had at the end of the quarter some significant new customer wins that when you look at the sales growth on salsa of well into double digits that was really driven both in retail and food service by new customer wins and with the  growth in salad dressings and marinades we also had customer wins there so we’re feeling very good about those businesses and what they’re contributing to our total results and what bay valley has been able to do for those businesses in terms of opening up customer doors operator your next question comes from robert moskow – credit suisse robert moskow – credit suisse i guess my question has to do with the  charge in fourth quarter you know maybe this is going to be more of an editorial than anything but you made a wise choice i guess in reducing your working capital requirements during this seasonal build up because you generated some cash flow you kind of give yourselves credit for that but then in fourth quarter you’re kind of breaking this one out and saying it’s a  charge so are you really also saying that there’s less product to sell in fourth quarter and if demand was really good are you leaving some demand on the table by not having that product to sell david b vermylen let me sort of provide an operational perspective and then dennis can add in just in terms of the financial metrics but no as we’ve engaged the organization in an eva and return on capital and employed metrics we’ve expanded the operators horizons on how we can improve shareholder value via beyond just our focus on quality of revenue and operating margins as i mentioned early in the year we took a hard look at our inventory levels especially as they related to building inventories going to those peak consumption periods and what we found was that we were building too much safety stock when you looked at forward inventory coverage now the two routes we could take with it would be to either do it over an extended period of time which would minimize any short term margin issues relating to absorption or be aggressive and make it a high priority and with inventory value rapidly escalating due to input cost increases we decided to be aggressive with our program as long as we could maintain those customer service levels while we knew it would have a negative effect on margins in the fourth quarter the cash flow opportunity was far too compelling to dissuade us now while we didn’t budget for it we determined i think rightfully so that it was the right thing to do we did not lose any sales opportunities associated with it because our customer service levels have stayed at the  to  through the whole period so we’re very pleased on where we have netted out and we will continue to look at our inventories as we move through  and see if there are additional opportunities on the inventory front to continue to improve cash flow dennis dennis f riordan yes and rob just a couple of numbers last year at the end of september we had about  days sales and inventory and this year we’re down to about  days and as david mentioned no change in customer service levels no lost orders we just realized as strong as our accounts receivable was and as well as we did there we weren’t quite holding it on the inventory side and we put a full court effort into improve that and the results were very strong but there will be a bit of a cost in q robert moskow – credit suisse so it doesn’t have any impact on leaving sales on the table or in fourth quarter david b vermylen absolutely not we would not – again rob our whole goal here was how far down could we take it without jeopardizing the customer service levels and there has been no disruption in that which indicates to me that down the road there may be additional opportunity robert moskow – credit suisse and then just one point of clarification on fourth quarter you said that you’re not getting any kind of pushback on the price increases that you want to take but then you said except in terms of some actions that you wanted to do in fourth quarter so does that mean that there’s other pricing you want to take beyond fourth quarter or are you not really looking at any additional pricing at all david b vermylen at this point as we’re putting together our plan we’ll look at every business and how commodity costs are going into – input costs are going to affect each part of the portfolio but in total we’re going to see – our estimate again is that mid single digits input cost inflation so we’re not anticipating the kind of pricing – anywhere near the kind of pricing that we had this year and in terms of some pushback from some customers it was very limited some of it related to some pricing on the nondairy creamer but nothing that was of any real significance robert moskow – credit suisse on the organic sales growth in north america retail you could quantify it as  it was about  in the second quarter it doesn’t sound – you know it’s not terrifically robust but i guess the salad dressing business has been very robust so if you kind of took a – if you added that into your organic sales kind of apples to apples then you would be a lot higher i’d imagine david b vermylen it would have been significantly higher and i should have calculated that out and sooner or later i will but the big thing rob in the third quarter was that on the pickle business when we were rationalizing those customers a lot of that was really starting in the second quarter and had the full effect in the third quarter but when you look at salsa the whole soup business and nondairy creamer the top line sales on those businesses were very good even nondairy creamer where we took significant price increases this year just because it was right in the sweet spot of all commodity cost increases we had unit volume growth in the third quarter operator your next question comes from jonathan feeney – wachovia capital markets llc jonathan feeney – wachovia capital markets llc i wanted to follow up a little bit on rob’s question more specifically i understand the merits of reducing days sales of inventory but it doesn’t seem like the action of a company that feels like it’s on the precipice of a volume acceleration and maybe some of the third party data especially if you think about how retailers have to run a private label program if they’re going to accelerate they need inventory i guess it seems like – it doesn’t sound like you’re expecting an awfully – you know anytime you have an acceleration volume in the fourth quarter so maybe if i could ask more specifically what can you tell us about your pipeline about the conversations you’re having with retailers that might affirm or deny the growth potential that seemed apparent here as private label accelerates david b vermylen we are expecting continued growth of the private label market and we’re optimistic about our own business i think as dennis pointed out we were sitting on levels of inventory that were significantly higher than we needed importantly what was going on was that as we were going into peak seasons on things such as soup and you’re looking at days of forward coverage we were increasing the number of days of forward coverage rather than say maintaining them at normal running rates just to have almost an obscene level of safety stock so we’ve been able to continue to drive the business forward even though we’ve taken  of the inventory out of the system frankly john we just had way too much inventory jonathan feeney – wachovia capital markets llc and you may be pars – i mean are there different areas where you had more inventory like pickles and more inventory reduction than some others david b vermylen i think soup was an area that we saw as a big opportunity dennis f riordan soup was the biggest and the others we had pretty much across the board in all the categories but soup was definitely the number one area jonathan feeney – wachovia capital markets llc could you give us an idea of the sensitivity what the puts and takes are on an operating basis for your currency exposure because i know you seem to have – i don’t know if you have more canadian dollar costs or revenues and maybe just – i know it’s a wide range of performance but could you maybe give us a sensitivity analysis of what kind of cash effect it has on the business ignoring the nonoperating asset and liability translation dennis f riordan yes jonathan we are as an entity nearly wholly covered on our puts and takes on the currency so our combination of canadian and us dollar sources and uses in canada comes very close to  it’s actually slightly more towards a  but it’s very very tight the decrease in the canadian exchange rate will have a small negative impact on us it goes slightly the other way but it hasn’t been a big enough number to even draw attention to so far this year despite currency going up and down quite a bit jonathan feeney – wachovia capital markets llc what is your current availability under that oh so attractive rate liquidity facility you have in place dennis f riordan the revolver can go up to  million and we have about at the end of september we had about  on outstanding under it jonathan feeney – wachovia capital markets llc so if you saw the deal of a lifetime tomorrow you have  to spend dennis f riordan well i guess in theory that practically doesn’t work out quite that way between the way the ratios go suffice to say there is some – there is availability under that line right now and with our cash flow being strong it will only increase as we move out into the latter part of this quarter and certainly into next year’s q and  operator your next question comes from ken goldman – jp morgan ken goldman – jp morgan just wanted to clarify a couple things that i think were said on the call is inflation supposed to be low single digits to mid single digits or just low single digits i think it was maybe stated a couple different ways dennis f riordan it’s low to mid single digits ken goldman – jp morgan and then a similar question about guidance for the year i think in the press release it was stated that earnings per share will still be in the guidance range you used throughout ’ but then if i’m reading this live transcript right you guys said  to  which is correct me if i’m wrong it’s a little bit above where you guys were last quarter so am i missing that or david b vermylen no what we said on the call script ken was excluding the  from that unfavorable variance that would be the  to  and in the earnings press release was not specific that that was called out so we didn’t show that as a particular call out so if you deduct the nickel from that you’d be in the  to  range so it just depends on what your perspective is as to how to treat that  ken goldman – jp morgan so if you take the mid point sort of that  to  compared to the previous you know the initial mid point of guidance you really have only raised it this year by  or  in terms of your earnings that’s not a lot considering the economy’s downturn is probably going to help your top line considering that at least since may oil and gas have come down or since the summer lowering maybe the cost you’d expect your tax rate is lower your interest rate may be lower because you paid down debt that’s a lot of tailwind so i’m looking at your guidance you’ve beaten the street six straight times you have all these tailwinds the question is why wouldn’t you beat again why should we not assume that you’re just being very conservative on q guidance david b vermylen i’m looking forward to feeling those tailwinds but we certainly have not yet as i mentioned in my comments the majority of our input costs for this year we contracted for in the second quarter in order that we could firm up our second half of the year pricing so those commodities have come down  there’s been really very little benefit to us for that one also comment on the fact that we’re heading with you’re saying the tailwinds that our oil costs for this year that is vegetable oil costs for this year are approximately  million higher than we had originally budgeted for and that  million in higher input costs versus budget translates to about  earnings per share so in terms of dealing with headwinds and tailwinds just on that single commodity alone we had a  earnings per share headwind and adding in all of the other above budget input costs the fact that we are heading towards our original guidance to me is a great testament to the resiliency and flexibility of the organization ken goldman – jp morgan i would assume then that given where commodity costs are now you would not look for that similar  per share increase based on vegetable oil next year it may even be – i don’t want to use the word tailwind because you’ve sort of poohpoohed that a little bit but it shouldn’t be nearly a headwind right david b vermylen no i think we will see a mixed bag of input cost increases i think that in my comments i said that we expect vegetable oil prices to be down but corn sweetener costs will be up tin plate and therefore metal cans costs will be up next year and crop fruits vegetables and cucumbers will be up but in total we think that the input cost basket will be up in the low to mid single digits although i will say when you look at each commodity on its own there going to be some big increases and some big decreases that average out that low to mid single digits so within the basket of costs there’ll be a lot of volatility but we are hopeful that in total they will be back to a more normalized running rate operator your next question comes from bob cummins – shields  company bob cummins – shields  company somebody asked earlier about your plans for acquisitions availability of funds etc etc and i think you mentioned that you were looking at some things so let me turn that around and ask you if there are any areas of the company that you might consider divesting i know you mentioned some large product areas earlier that are not considered your growth vehicles would that be something that you would consider or do those kinds of products play a part in the management of your business even though they’re not growing sam k reed with regard to those portions of the portfolio where the strategy indicates that there is little in the way of growth opportunity or long term improvement what we’re really focused on is continuing to run those as a part of the portfolio and to date what we have done in limited instances is close excess facilities and i won’t comment on whether there are specific plans or not with regard to divestitures but as a general matter these are businesses that as we’ve looked at the various options the better course again as a general matter is to continue to operate them both with a little bit of resources and very little investment and to use the positive cash flow out of those businesses to pay down debt and prepare ourselves for the future operator your next question comes from donald thiessen – century capital management donald thiessen –century capital management can you give us – you’ve itemized three items that you’ve backed out of your earnings can you give us pretax amounts of those items and what line items they impacted dennis f riordan typically they will show up on the third page of the detail in the back in our press release we had the reconciliation in that we showed a loss on currency translations  million that shows up in other expense the acquisition integration was  – donald thiessen – century capital management but those are after tax numbers i’m looking at yes no dennis f riordan those are pretax numbers operator your last question comes from bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey just trying to understand the industrial ingredient category and just the growth there and how we should look at that on a go forward basis david b vermylen well i think the ingredient business which is principally nondairy creamer this year the tonnage is relatively flat compared to prior years the revenue was up quite a bit because it has been so driven by increases in commodity costs principally vegetable oils casein prices and corn sweeteners the other part of that business really is contract hacking and in general we have pretty long term agreements with our major customers where we are producing principal in the areas of soup contract agreements as well as infant feeding contract agreements bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey so it should at least continue at this revenue level for the next couple of quarters david b vermylen well i think the revenue as i mentioned on the call some of our industrial business the ingredient business nondairy creamer has cost you know passed through contracts so there could be early next year some reductions in that revenue but it will not affect the profitability of that business it will really be just a pass through on the reduction in the input costs and not on our margin per pound bill chappell – suntrust robinson humphrey and then one last one on the food away from home did you see that business slow inter quarter or was it pretty steady and kind of similar to prior quarter trends david b vermylen yes pretty steady across the quarter the good news for us there is that with the addition of san antonio farms that the – last year we really were able to start developing new customers for food away from home salsa and that helped us to offset some of the underlying food away from home consumption decline and with the addition of ed smith and they have a in canada a very good sauce program all different types of cooking sauces under what they call the saucemaker plan we are developing that program down here and it has been launched but we see a lot of new customer development for that business that’ll take place in  so as the fundamentals of food away from home are negative the addition of salsa and salad dressing and sauces will help offset the fundamental decline operator your next question comes from robert moskow – credit suisse robert moskow – credit suisse you know consensus estimates are already baking in  and eps growth for ’ and we’re going to be laughing all the acquisitions so i was wondering are there any benefits in ’ that you can call out today on incremental synergies or on the cost side or even on the revenue side that make comparison a little bit easier we already know about the cost inflation but i was wondering if there was anything else sam k reed i think with regard to the business that we have now we will see a continuation of some basic trends that are favorably affecting us now as i indicated we expect the economy will stay weak and that will at the margins favor value over luxury and we’ll get that benefit of it with regard to lower inflation we expect that in a couple more quarters we’ll be able to have fully closed the gap that was created on the lag time following the huge run up in commodity and oil costs importantly the combined use of the eva analysis and the portfolio’s strategy have provided us not only as david indicated a road map but frankly surprised us in a couple of instances of businesses that were kind of buried within ed smith in particular that as we dug into the detail we found that there are a few small jewels there that we believe can take – be made better because of the extensive nature of our treehouse network and the economies that scale it and our supply chain and then lastly the internal improvements at this business cannot be over emphasized there is in every corner of the business a real drive to improve productivity develop more meaningful innovation that fits the needs of our customers and in particular as david also indicated from a procurement standpoint take a longer lead time and make better bets with regard to what these commodity and energy prices will do over a longer lead time so that while we are adjusting we are not behind the eight ball trying to catch up desperately to a situation that’s running away from us and while we have developed those programs and we’ll give you more detail in the february call i think in their aggregate it is our sense that those are developments that in combination will lead to significant improvement even with the base business robert moskow – credit suisse so does that kind of mean that you think that  growth you probably don’t normally guide that high all else being equal does that mean you’re kind of optimistic that ’ could be a better than base case type of year sam k reed we’ll put a number on it in february operator and we have no more questions at this time i’d like to turn the call back to mr reed sam k reed thanks everybody we very much appreciate your interest in treehouse

companys products  ukbased united biscuit company acquires keebler  leveraged buyout of keebler from united biscuit is completed sunshine biscuit co is subsequently acquired  name changes to keebler foods company  keebler acquires president baking co flowers industries becomes majority shareholder of keebler after initial public offering  keebler acquires austin quality foods inc company history keebler foods company majority owned by flowers industries inc is the second largest cookie and cracker manufacturer in the united states marketing its products in more than  retail locations in the country and in selected international markets keeblers brands include cheezit famous amos plantation murray ready crust and its signature keebler brand in addition to manufacturing private label cookies and crackers the company ranks as the leading manufacturer of girl scout cookies producing more than  percent of such cookies sold thcentury origins keebler took its name from godfrey keebler who in  opened a small bakery in philadelphia godfreys bakery earned the distinction of becoming the first member of a network of local bakeries that later was amalgamated under the keebler corporate umbrella the other constituent bakeries opened up in subsequent generations neighborhood bakeries that operated under the names streitmann hekman supreme and bowman the affiliated bakeries came under the control of a single corporate entity when the united biscuit company of america was formed in  by the time of united biscuits formation the value of geographically separate bakeries operating under a single organization had proven its worth with the advent of the automobile a fleet of trucks enabled the locally oriented bakeries to develop into regional bakeries providing the locomotion for a territorywidening distribution system by  the network of affiliates comprised  bakeries whose geographic scope included markets stretching from salt lake city utah to godfrey keeblers home city of philadelphia more than a century passed from the opening of godfrey keeblers bakery to the adoption of the keebler name as the unifying corporate title for the entire organization in the decades leading up to that signal decision the crackers and cookies were marketed under the brand names of their respective bakeries a sprawling assortment of products and labels as diverse as the number of bakeries that constituted united biscuits ranks eventually however the management of the bakery network tightened the structure of its organization aping a corporate trend that swept from coast to coast during the s countless companies embraced the benefits to be found in centralizing all corporate functions under a single entity the management of united biscuit followed suit realizing that greater corporate efficiency quality control and marketing effectiveness could be achieved by operating under one corporate banner accordingly in  keebler was adopted as the corporate title for the bakery network and the single brand name for all the bakery products although the debut of the keebler brand name marked the introduction of one of the most recognizable brand names in the country enviable marketing strength was not enough for the elmhurstbased company to overcome its fiercest rival nabisco inc nabisco like keebler was formed from a consortium of bakeries beginning business in  by the latter half of the th century the new jerseybased cookie and cracker manufacturer had developed into a towering force its market share representing the yardstick by which keeblers progress was measured  united biscuit acquisition proves a failure keebler remained an independent company until  when it was acquired by united biscuit company one of the largest food manufacturers in the united kingdom within the corporate folds of united biscuit keebler operated as a unit of ub investments us inc a subsidiary of the british parent company that would preside over keeblers operations for the next two decades organized as such keebler continued its perennial battle against nabisco but eventually the strategy underpinning the companys war plan proved selfdestructive at united biscuit behest keebler concentrated on developing and marketing salty snacks such as zesta saltines which critics contended diverted the companys attention from its core expertise in cookies and crackers further keebler drew criticism for trying to directly compete against nabiscos stalwart brands such as fritolay instead of building its market share in product niches where nabiscos strength was more assailable ultimately the period of united biscuits ownership turned keebler into an unprofitable company a period so claimed adweek eastern edition on october   when keebler did almost everything wrong in  the last year of united biscuits control keebler registered  million in losses the time had come for profound changes to be made  new management sparks rapid growth two individuals were credited with keeblers revival sam reed who would become the companys president and ceo and david vermylen who would oversee the management of keeblers brands vermylen had spent  years working for general foods marketing brands such as stove top stuffing birds eye and post cereals in  he joined his wife in business and for the next three years the pair worked as marketing consultants in  the vermylens received a telephone call from sam reed who had worked with vermylens wife a decade earlier reed a snack and baking industry veteran of more than  years was about to become the new chief executive office of mothers cookies and he solicited the vermylens for help in developing marketing strategies david vermylen and sam reed ended up working side by side at mothers cookies with vermylen joining as the companys vicepresident of marketing before earning promotion to the post of president reed and vermylen arrived at keebler in january  concurrent with their arrival a leveraged buyout lbo of the company from united biscuit was begun restoring it was hoped keeblers capability to turn a profit thomasville georgiabased flowers industries a producer of fresh and frozen baked foods and artal luxembourg sa acquired keebler through a jointventure arrangement installing reed and vermylen as the saviors they would soon prove to be the companys vicepresident of research and development remarked in a november  interview with food processing the leveraged buyout was a catalyst for a huge change in our method of strategic direction sam reed set the tone and standard and provided the permission to change reed radically altered the organizational structure of keebler placing a great emphasis on research and development one aspect of the companys operations that had benefited from the era of united biscuit ownership in  keebler opened an squarefoot technical center in elmhurst for cookie and cracker development projects designed to replicate a functional bakery including receiving docks a mixing room ovens and manufacturing lines the technical center enabled keebler to test all possible scenarios and it enabled reed to develop products for niches where nabiscos dominance was less resilient new product introductions played a pivotal role in the turnaround campaign begun in  reed instilled a renewed spirit of freedom and creativity among employees and reorganized the chain of command affecting research and development new products more than a dozen a year were the result meanwhile vermylen developed a portfolio strategy that emphasized keebler as the companys signature brand toward this end reed revived ernie keebler a cartoon character that acted as the companys spokesperson and his attendant elves the use of ernie keebler and the elves had been discontinued under united biscuits ownership but the fictional figures played a prominent role in the companys advertising and marketing campaigns and as the symbolic centerpiece of the new corporate culture cultivated by reed and vermylen the most visible aspect of keeblers progress following the lbo occurred on the acquisition front roughly six months after joining keebler reed acquired sunshine biscuit co the third largest cookie and cracker manufacturer in the country sunshine biscuit was best known to consumers for its cheezit brand of snacks which generated  million in annual sales at the time of the keebler acquisition reed hoped to increase the brands sales volume by distributing cheezit through new distribution channels and by relying on his research and development department to develop new varieties of cheezit snacks under sunshine biscuits ownership cheezit snacks had been sold in supermarkets and convenience stores a distribution foundation reed built on by making the brand available in vending machines and mass merchandising outlets with greater exposure to consumers cheezit sales began to climb particularly after a flurry of product line extensions keebler introduced hot and spicy cheezit nacho cheezit cheezit chipits and cheezit heads and tales crackers which were targeted to children the new product offerings and the additional distribution channels in which cheezit snacks were sold boosted sales considerably more than doubling the brands sales volume during the late s the resounding success of the sunshine biscuit purchase convinced reed of the gains to be made by pursuing growth through acquisitions to finance further acquisitions reed celebrated his second anniversary at keebler by taking the company public completing an initial public offering ipo of stock in january  nearly  million shares were sold at  per share which gave reed the financial wherewithal to contemplate his next move on the acquisition front by september  he had reached an agreement to acquire a private company owned by taiwanbased president enterprises corp the largest food company in taiwan reeds target was president baking co a nearly millioninsales cookie manufacturer that ranked as the fourth largest company of its kind in the united states headquartered in atlanta president baking manufactured famous amos cookies plantation brownies murray and murray sugar free cookies and ranked as the leading supplier of girl scout cookies accounting for  percent of total production keeblers acquisition of president baking was strategically important for several reasons keebler enjoyed tremendous national brand recognition but if the company had a geographic weak point it was in the southeastern united states where president bakings murray brand of cookies was strongest aside from providing a core customer base in the southeast the murray brand also steered keebler considered a premium brand company into the value brand category equally as important president baking possessed a distribution system geared for delivering products to convenience stores which complemented keeblers strength in distributing crackers and cookies to supermarkets in january  reed established two new business units to help integrate the distribution of president bakings brands into keeblers existing distribution system mothers cookie co was formed to oversee the girl scout cookie business and other specialty channels and murray biscuit co was organized to manage direct store delivery and direct sales group channels president baking co inc was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of keebler as the cumbersome task of incorporating president baking into the growing keebler organization progressed the effect of reeds influence over the company was tangibly evident in less than three years he had added nearly  billion in sales while leading a remarkable turnaround in profitability the  million loss posted by keebler before his arrival had transformed into a  million profit by the end of  although the company lagged behind nabisco controlling approximately  percent of the market for cookies and crackers sold to supermarkets drugstores and mass merchandisers compared to nabiscos  percent market share the strides achieved under reeds leadership were remarkable nonetheless the announcement that the president baking purchase was the first of many acquisitions to come promised further advances in the shortterm future as keebler entered the st century reed demonstrated his commitment to further acquisitions by announcing a pending  million deal in january  he agreed to acquire privately held austin quality foods a millioninsales manufacturer of cookies and crackers that was best known for its zoo animal crackers brand on the heels of the austin quality foods deal speculation arose regarding keeblers relationship with its parent company flowers industries was expected at least by some to sell keebler or spin it off as a separate company at some point in  as industry pundits offered their various theories regarding the affect of flowers industries future decision on keebler one fact remained clear keebler under the vibrant leadership of reed was pushing forward impressively something the company was expected to do in the future regardless of its relationship with flowers
