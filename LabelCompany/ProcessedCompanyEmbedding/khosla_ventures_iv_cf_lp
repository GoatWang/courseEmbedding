model innovations unique partnerships and topnotch teams  broadly a venture we back offers one or more of the factors belowsignificant technology or business model innovationunusual technology approaches ventures into new markets or contrarian approaches to existing markets“black swan” ideas with significant upside or a significantly better mousetrapblack swans are highimpact innovations beyond the realm of normal expectations as nassim nicholas taleb put it black swans are characterized by rarity extreme impact and retrospective predictabilityhighimpact investments can change the dynamics of large markets can we alter the design of an engine to substantially change its efficiency and make it more economic than hybrid drivetrains can we make cleaner building materials going beyond normal expectations means we take on the challenge of rethinking the familiar can we store energy in elements other than lithium or can we make lithiumion batteries betterlarge markets either existing or newly enabled by the innovation at hand will you disrupt a large existing market we love breaking monopolies or can you find a billion dollar market versus a million dollar market with a credible path to growshort innovation cyclesstartups by nature take on more risk than larger established competitors however the nature of startups also adds significant difficulty to getting large capitalintensive projects up and running instead we look for rapid innovation cycles so proof points and results are available quickly whether good or bad that said we also break our own rules we have invested in a nuclear reactor with long innovation cycles because other factors were compellingupfront riskevery plan has risks and we both understand and cherish risk but we prefer technology risk to market risk and we prefer to remove technology and business risks up front clearly identified and understood risks along with a cogent plan for removing those risks for the least amount of money is an important criteria for evaluating ventures it is more advantageous to all parties to fail in six months and on  than in six years and  million — we want to focus on the key risks earlyif you have a compelling technologybased story or are exceptionally accomplished or credentialed we are willing to listen we are not looking for good roi we are looking to build companies in our view the roi follows the company building we will help you redefine your plan to meet these criteria if the technology breakthroughs are significant  contact us  khosla ventures contact us to be considered for
