cvbr is a vertebral body replacement device indicated for use in the cervical spine spanning ct vertebral bodies in skeletally mature patients to replace a diseased or damaged vertebral body caused by tumor fracture or osteomyelitis or for reconstruction following corpectomy performed to achieve decompression of the spinal cord and neural tissues in cervical degenerative disorders the cvbr system is intended to be used with supplemental fixation cleared by the fda for use in the cervical spine these implants are intended for use with autograft or allogenic bone graft comprising cancellous andor corticocancellous bone graft as an adjunct to fusion the cvbr system is also intended to restore the integrity of the spinal column even in the absence of fusion for a limited time period in patients with advanced stage tumors involving the cervical spine in whom life expectancy is of insufficient duration to permit achievement of fusion with bone graft used at the surgeon’s discretion

pistoncylinder shape and may be hydraulically expanded using sterile saline after being implanted by the surgeon coalign created an articulating insertion handle for the surgeon to use to ensure optimal implant positioning between vertebral bodies as the acculif cage expands a spring activated automatic locking mechanism locks the implant at mm increments finally the engineers built into the implant a link between the two locking cylinders which ensures that the device will lock evenly coalign is located at  north hill drive suite  brisbane california  phone  allostem® stem cell bone

collected from the surgical site during spine fusion surgery bonebac press improves upon the customary bone harvesting methods in several ways unlike traditional bone harvesting bonebac press keeps the harvested bone at the surgical site using a vacuum hose the bonebac pulls harvested bone into the press once collected the surgeon can separate blood and fluid from the bone using the easy press system bonebac press is reusable and sterilizable the system was designed to also work with allograft bone extenders finally using the bonebac press spine surgeons can significantly reduce if not eliminate secondary graft site morbidity bonebac press’s inventor is mick perezcruet md ms he can be reached at perezcruetyahoocom you can reach thompson mis at infothompsonmiscom or call  hydrolift vertebral body replacement system – aesculap inc from left to right larry rubens  vpaesculap implant systems sales chuck dinardo  president and ceo jeffrey cole  director spine marketing gordon young  product manager spine and ira benson  vp spine marketing  the hydrolift vertebral body replacement system the hydrolift vertebral body replacement system uses hydrostatic pressure to expand and maintain distraction of the disc space other expandable cages use a screw mechanism or ratchet style mechanical approach to achieve distraction because of this other cages require a very high cross sectional area and therefore excess bone removal while performing the corpectomy since hydrolift uses hydrostatic pressure and an external hydraulic pump surgeons can preserve more of the patient’s host bone finally the hydrolift incorporates a failsafe mechanism in the hydraulic pump which limits the amount of pressure available to minimize or prevent endplate damage aesculap can be reached at  corporate parkway center valley pennsylvania  phone  magnetic expansion control magec™ – ellipse technologies inc the engineering team from ellipse from left to right is peter tran arvin chang blair walker and scott pool the magec™ dual rodsthe magnetic expansion system uses a cylindrical radiallypoled internal magnet to noninvasively lengthen or shorten an implanted rod early onset scoliosis patients have spinal deformity which is diagnoses before the age of ten surgically fusing the spines of these patients at such a young age creates an enormous risk of permanently undersizing the thoracic cavity and therefore reducing the amount of space for developing lungs and organs repeated surgeries to adjust rod length raises new problems the magec™ system solves this problem the magnet inside magec’s rods drives a lead screw which moves the two ends of the rod the surgeon controls the magnet using an external remote controller erc in a lengthening procedure the patient lies awake on an examining table the erc is placed on the patient’s back and within a few minutes the magec rod has been noninvasively lengthened if the patient feels discomfort the rod can also be shortened until the discomfort disappears ellipse technologies may be reached at  alton parkway suite  irvine california  phone  nociscan™ virtual discogram™ – nocimed llc james peacock  ceo nocimed llc and nociscan™ virtual discogram™nociscan is a noninvasive test which distinguishes painful from nonpainful lumbar discs and thereby better localizes the source of chronic severe discogenic low back pain nociscan is a custom proprietary software application that works in concert with commercially available magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs pulse sequence installed on standard high field mri systems nociscan’s proprietary protocols create a noninvasive exam to acquire chemical information from lumbar intervertebral discs the data is processed to measure “disc pain biomarkers” in the discs that have been correlated to pain nociscan then uses a diagnostic algorithm based on measured biomarkers to generate a “nociscore” which is useful for distinguishing painful from nonpainful discs nocimed is located at the plug and play tech center  convention way redwood city california  phone  osteoamp structural – advanced biologics llc from left to right scott calotte  vp sales  marketing amit govil  president and jason mattiello  strategic sales  marketing manager the osteoamp structural  interbody spacersosteoamp is an allograft derived interbody spacer and granules which according to the company has more growth factors than dbms and in animal models grows bone at a higher rate than stem cells or synthetics the key to osteoamp is the process advanced biologics uses to create the material collagen subfibrils are swelled to increase growth factor binding sites the growth factors contained within bone marrow are solubilized and the soluble growth factors then bind to the swollen collagen subfibrils when the subfibrils are reduced back to their original size and configuration they have a higher amount of bmp than for example  dbm products the process in other words significantly increases the growth factor content of the implant advanced biologics is located at  corporate drive suite  ladera ranch california  phone  prow™ fusion intervertebral body fusion device – nlt spine from left to right robin young  publisher otw and didier toubia  chief ececutive officer nlt spine the prow™ fusion interventebral body fusion devicethe prow device is a tool for distracting preparing and filling the intervertebral space less invasively mm width conduit and thereby magnify the benefits of minimally invasive tlif procedures shorter length of stay shorter time to ambulation and lower overall cost the key to the prow is its unique conduit—which is really a kind of cannula but with so much more engineering and capabilities that it is more accurately described as a conduit the articulating conduit gives the surgeon the ability to insert and use large implants and surgical tools through a small incision because the tool articulates it enters the body straight but then sequentially deflects at an accurate inflection point so as to form a predefined shape on the treatment site nlt spine may be reached at  yoni netanyahu street or yehuda israel
