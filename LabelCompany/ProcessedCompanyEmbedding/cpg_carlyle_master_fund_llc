twitter email print a general view of the lobby outside of the carlyle group offices in washington thomson reuters reuters  carlyle group lp has decided to liquidate the two mutual funds it launched last year regulatory filings showed this week as the private equity firm seeks other ways to gain more traction with socalled liquid alternative funds developing mutual funds has historically been challenging for private equity firms because the average buyout fund is illiquid with a typical life span of  years but as these firms diversified into relatively more liquid alternative assets such as credit and hedge funds they have sought to widen their base beyond institutional investors next month carlyle will close carlyle global core allocation fund which has  million in net assets with a mandate to invest across equities debt real estate commodities and currencies using exchangetraded funds according to a filing with the us securities and exchange commission carlyle enhanced commodity real return fund which had a mandate to invest in asset classes such as energy and metals but never took off will also be wound down according to a second filing the move leaves carlyle with diversified global asset management corp dgam a fundsofhedgefunds manager it acquired in february  as its main platform for launching liquid alternative products the carlyle group managing director david rubenstein reutersjonathan ernst dgam has developed a number of liquid alternative funds aimed primarily at institutional investors rather than the retail investors who invest in mutual funds some of these dgam alternative funds could be marketed soon according to a person with knowledge of carlyles plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly these products perform better in the current lowvolatility market environment rather than the highvolatility environment that the mutual funds would have thrived on that person added carlyle could decide to launch another mutual fund in the future the person said a carlyle spokesman declined to comment the strategic shift comes one year after carlyle hired jeff holland a former senior executive at mutual fund conglomerate blackrock inc to lead efforts to introduce alternative assets to eligible individual investors carlyle has also developed other products aimed at increasing the liquidity of its traditionally illiquid offerings a captive feeder fund called cpg carlyle private equity fund llc which allows individuals with net worth in excess of  million to commit as little as  to its private equity fund portfolio had  million
