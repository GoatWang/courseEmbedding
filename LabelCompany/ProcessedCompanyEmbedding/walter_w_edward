building   the first carton flow manufacturer lansing shields president of grand union co applied for patents for the original gravityfeed rear load design using unistrut and nylon strips in  later approved in  the unit consisted of several inclined runways the device was driven by gravity the concept was a stockman would place merchandise in the rear of each runway and as a shopper selected an item the item behind it would slide forward in place of the previous one mr shields being impressed with walter gauer as a young entrepreneur with a unique sales style asked him if he and his partners had any interest in manufacturing his shelving concept mr gauer realizing the potential of working with mr shields quickly discussed this with his partners and began manufacturing these carton flow units for grand union under mr shields’s label of foodomat when lansing shields died of a heart attack thomas butler was appointed the new president of grand union butler had no interest in continuing to use carton flow units in grand union supermarkets foodomat went off on its own to sell the product with gauer as its manufacturer this early work led to the eventual development of the florak line

taguchi frederick w taylor j edgar thomson walter shewhart  the grandfather of total quality management his ideas the original notions of total quality management and continuous improvement trace back to a former bell telephone employee named walter shewhart one of w edwards demings teachers he preached the importance of adapting management processes to create profitable situations for both businesses and consumers promoting the utilization of his own creation  the spc control chart dr shewhart believed that lack of information greatly hampered the efforts of control and management processes in a production environment in order to aid a manager in making scientific efficient economical decisions he developed statistical process control methods many of the modern ideas regarding quality owe their inspirtation to dr shewhart he also developed the shewhart cycle learning and improvement cycle combining both creative management thinking with statistical analysis this cycle contains four continuous steps plan do study and act these steps commonly refered to as the pdsa cycle shewhart believed ultimately lead to total quality improvement the cycle draws its structure from the notion that constant evaluation of management practices  as well as the willingness of management to adopt and disregard unsupported ideas are keys to the evolution of a successful enterprise to
