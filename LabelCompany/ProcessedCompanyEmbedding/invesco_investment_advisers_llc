aerospace and defense firms us aerospace and defense orders are rising after showing flat to declining growth since  us defense orders — which include aircraft related parts and other military hardware produced by the department of defense — have been trending upward and are now approaching  highs as a result of revitalized defense spending that began under president obama and looks to increase even more under president trump the president’s recently unveiled budget proposal calls for a   billion increase in military spending which is likely to be wellreceived by many members of the gopled congress nondefense aircraft orders have seen similar patterns after a choppy few years sixmonth average aircraft order volume tailed off through the first half of  but has advanced since then

flow through to the bottom line in the form of healthy profit growth global defense spending could rise as well the trump administration has suggested that european member nations of the north atlantic treaty organization nato should contribute more to defense spending the chart below shows what nato members currently contribute as a percentage of gross domestic product in my view it would
