gilead sciences valeant pharmaceuticals and gilead sciences both look dirt cheap but only one of these stocks is a real bargain george budwell tmfgbudwell jul   at am when it comes to the highflying healthcare sector there arent many bargains to be had president trumps recent change of heart regarding the possibility of hard caps on highpriced prescription drugs after all sparked a widespread rally thats caused valuations to balloon over the past month or so  valeant pharmaceuticals international nysevrx and gilead sciences nasdaqgild however are two highprofile names that are still arguably cheap  at least based on their rockbottom pricetosales ratios of  and  respectively armed with this insight lets consider which of these two bargainbin healthcare stocks is the better buy right now  image source getty images valeant digging its way out of a deep hole valeants superaggressive growthbyacquisition strategy proved to be its undoing when the companys pricing practices drew the ire of regulators and politicians alike the net result is a company with a staggering amount of leverage on its balance sheet  illustrated by its jawdropping debttoequity ratio of  a falling ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and a share price thats now well off its fiveyear highs  on the bright side valeants fairly new ceo joseph papa has begun the herculean task of righting the ship so to speak since taking the reigns papa has focused heavily on reducing the companys monstrous debt load and improving its financial flexibility the company has now divested multiple noncore assets such as its dendreon business and most recently its skincare subsidiary obagi medical products to achieve papas stated goal of reducing debt by  billion by early  unfortunately valeants debt problem is so bad that even  billion wont be enough to markedly improve the companys balance sheet more has to be done to move the needle on this critical risk factor and thats where valeants enticing value proposition seems to come off the rails long story short valeant simply doesnt have enough organic growth coming down the pike to avoid the divestiture of a core asset that would radically alter its value proposition to investors its newly approved psoriasis drug siliq for instance is facing a bevy of competitive threats that could very well keep it from making much headway in the highvalue antiinflammatory market thats a serious problem as siliq was expected to be a key growth product for the company heading into next year and beyond   in the final analysis valeant doesnt appear to have much choice but to cut bait with a significant asset within the next two years and that could include its allimportant bausch  lomb business segment  gilead wheres the growth gilead has been in biotech purgatory for awhile now due to the companys reluctance to address its faltering hepatitis c franchise with a bolton acquisition the companys quarterly revenues after all have been in steep decline for a solid yearandahalf as a result of higher competition and pushback from payers worse still this negative trend is only expected to accelerate as more potent competitors enter the market  such as abbvies glecaprevirpibrentasvir combo therapy thats presently under review with the food and drug administration fda  gilead for its part has actively championed its considerable pipeline efforts in antiinflammatory conditions nonhep c liver diseases cancer and of course hiv as reasons to be optimistic about the companys growth prospects moving forward at the end of the day though these ongoing clinical programs arent expected to bear fruit anytime soon with one notable exception gileads nextgen hiv combo medicine bictegravirftaf which is forecast to become a topselling drug by  point blank the acquisition of a revenuegenerating peer is essential to gileads nearterm growth prospects the company shouldnt have any problem going this route given that it exited the most recent quarter with  billion in cash and cash equivalents even so gilead hasnt shown any outward signs that its gearing up for a major acquisition soon complicating matters further the ongoing rally among pharma stocks may make a buyout even less attractive to the biotechs rather conservative management team   which stock is the better buy gilead wins this matchup by default valeant after all is a mess thats going to require ceo joseph papa perhaps a decade or even longer to clean up gilead by contrast still has tremendous
