recently engaged in a m ipo on december th  silver bay realty is externally managed by prcm realty trust llc a joint venture between pine river domestic management lp and provident real estate advisors llc prcm will manage the day to day operations of silver bay realty and collect fees for services such as asset management property management and acquisitions the initial portfolio of real estate is comprised of  single family homes with an average rent of  and vacancy of  silver bay realtys core properties were acquired in two separate transactions with two harbors realty and provident real estate advisors llc i believe silver bay realty has the potential to be a great long term value play the companys balance sheet offers significant value in the form of  in cash per common share and an nav of  per share the value of the balance sheet above is not capitalized and the properties are valued on a carrying basis at fair value if silver bay realty can generate and noi of  to  silver bay realty will be in a position to benefit from a higher valuation armed with an noi in the range of  and a  cap rate for single family properties the value of the real estate portfolio will increase exponentially however this value could quickly become diminished if silver bay realty and prcm are unable to manage overhead the companies  million in cash need to be allocated carefully and aggressive acquisition coupled with the six month stabilization period for properties doesnt allow any room for mistakes dividends need to be paid and share dilution or leverage could compromise a balance sheet in its present state that is mortgage free and cash rich the big test will be if silver bay realtys manager prcm realty trust llc has the ability to turn around the core portfolios vacancy of  estimates provided by the companys prospectus paint a bleak picture for the first quarter with  single family units and a vacancy rate of  illustrated below the company will not be profitable until it can significantly stabilize its geographical diaspora of properties corporate structure while the corporate chart above seems daunting it is a modified version of an upreit or an umbrella partnership reit besides a few small differences in silver bay realty trusts fee structure these structures are very common entities known as upreits transfer operating units op in exchange for interest commercial property creating a tax deferred transaction for the seller two harbors investors and provident investors llc in addition to op units stock in silver bay realty trust corp is now owned by provident investors  two harbors  which were received in consideration for silver bay realtys core portfolio common shares represent ownership in silver bay realty trust a public stock silver bay realty trust corp owns a general partner interest in silver bay operating partnership lp the source of operating units to be distributed in addition to common shares provident entities  properties come from  managed funds  polar cactus llc  polar cactus ii llc  cool willow llc  provident residential real estate fund llc and  resi ii llc all of which are owned by private investors

million shares of common stock in silver bay realty trust corp the total amount of common shares and op units outstanding following the completion of the above transactions is  the baseline gross rental income from the core properties acquired upon ipo on december th is the product of an average rent of  per unit illustrated above and  units  occupancy which equals  per month and  per quarter prcm real estate investors llc has a management agreement with silver bay realty trust corp that gives prcm the right to certain fees and reimbursements in consideration for certain services the following table illustrates the asset management and property management fee structure outlined in silver bay realty trust corps  sec form b prospectus rule b the fees described below will be paid to prcm realty trust llc and its subsidiary silver bay realty property group  ownership by prcm advisory management fee silver bay realty trust corp will pay prcm  of the daily average of its fully diluted marketcap for the preceding quarter a  annual rate less any property management fees received by prcm subsidiary silver bay realty property corp property management and acquisition services fees to silver bay realty property corp prcm subsidiary  of certain costs and expenses will be reimbursed to silver bay realty property corp stemming from the acquisition marketing leasing and management of singlefamily properties on silver bay realty management corps behalf general and administrative expenses reimbursement reimbursement for all expenses incurred by prcm on silver bay realtys behalf or otherwise in connection with the operation of its business other than compensation for the ceo while it is impossible to determine what general and administrative expenses will be as they have yet to be released the addition of this line item creates further overhead payable to prcm prcm has an acquisition staff of  brokers and sales agents and  property managers in states without a full time staff prcm subcontracts services with companies familiar with the market this creates a level of uncertainty that seems volatile a few periods of operating results will be a key for investors to determine whether this strategy is organized enough to property manage costs and oversight into diverse markets the best case scenario the asset management fee of  multiplied by the average daily market cap  represents a  operating margin for asset management alone assuming  vacancy in other words currently  of gross rent is dedicated to paying asset management fees to prcm however silver bay estimates that a significant portion of the  properties owned by prudent realty were purchased within the last six months should silver bay lease the remainder of its core portfolio and have a handful of new acquisitions stabilized in six months silver bay realty can expect a maximum gross rent of  per month and a maximum of  for its second quarter estimate unfavorable scenarios reimbursements fees due to prcm are a mystery and prcms ability to manage a geographically diverse portfolio will be a serious challenge unfortunately we may not know whether the companys strategy has been a success for another half year as silver bay estimates the majority of the portfolio it has acquired from its predecessors have been purchased within the last six months this is significant because silver bay realty estimates properties will take on average six months to renovate market and lease one troubling section of silver bay realtys december prospectus is the companies estimate of annual advisory fee due to prcm the estimate above indicates that the company believes its average market cap if divisible by the same amount of shares outstanding will be  in order to reconcile this the company either expects to have a flat price through  or plans on diluting shares in addition to internal challenges the us housing bureaus last estimate in september of  was  vacancy rate for single family homes single family homes are among the one rental sector to experience a rise in vacancies possible due to low interest rates the low interest rate environment could pose a problem for silver bay realty trust as existing home sales have begun to increase while single family rental rates have decreased while economic conditions in the housing market are beginning to turn against single family rentals housing recovery does offer one benefit to silver bay realty trust price appreciation the chart below taken from silver bay realtys december prospectus illustrate home value appreciation in the markets silver bay realty has a presence conclusion while i believe there is serious value on the balance sheet of silver bay realty trust profitability and success is a waiting game with an estimate of a  month stabilization period for properties acquired by silver bay realty trust corp it has yet to be seen whether this can be accomplished in harmony with general and administrative expenses reimbursements and additional fees should the portfolio stabilize only to have its profit eaten away by fees the endeavor will be useless and the company will have to reexamine its corporate structure waiting before investing also provides us with time to consider the economic impact of a housing recovery and what role it will play in property stabilization if prcm and silver bay realty have success in the next six months endeavor and generates a healthy noi i am a buyer for now i watch with great curiosity and anticipation if silver bay realty and prcm can pull off a successful enterprise they will be the pioneers of single family rentals in the public market and i believe other mortgage reits with massive portfolios of foreclosed portfolios will complete

bay realty trust  a business model doomed to failapr   about silver bay sby alpha shark longshort equitysilver bay realty trust  a business model doomed to fail background silver bay realty trust corp nysesby or silver bay is the first real estate investment trust reit that focuses solely on the acquisition renovation leasing and management of singlefamily properties it raised  million mostly from foreign investors looking to capitalize on their currency advantage in its initial public offering in december  but it is not the only company with this idea privateequity firm blackstone group lp and other companies are also gambling on the singlefamily home rental market these include colony capital llc maynada investment group and pacifica companies llc the following is based on information from the prospectus dated december   k filed march   for the period ending december   as well as other sources silver bays strategy silver bay management believes they can create economies of scale through the large scale purchase of reo inventory held for sale by banks governmentsponsored entities gses and other mortgage lenders or guarantors the idea is to use investment money to purchase homes at prices below replacement value and then renovate and lease them to former homeowners who lost property to foreclosure and are unable to buy as of december   silver bay owned approximately  singlefamily properties in arizona california florida georgia nevada north carolina ohio and texas the singlefamily home business model the single family home rental market has historically been dominated by momand pop outfits including retirees real estate brokers doctors and other professionals some of these were unwilling landlords renting out their former home with the expectation that it could be sold at a later time after the value increased others viewed their rental properties as sideline or supplemental retirement income in an attempt to diversify and  or hedge inflation depending on the tenant the condition of the home and the neighborhood a landlord could expect to expend considerable time and money in managing the tenant and maintaining the home when the home is occupied when unoccupied the home will require more attention to keep it in shape for potential renters especially if the area has many other rental properties available the home will also need to be monitored for vandalism or theft many vacant homes are being scavenged for copper appliances and other valuable fixtures after having issues with tenants neighbors and  or the homeowners association a landlord may decide a rental is too much to handle and may decide to either sell the home to remove the headache or hire a management company that takes a percentage of the rent to market manage and maintain the property hiring a management company may seem convenient to a landlord that either does not have the time or lives far from the rented property but it also has some drawbacks issues with the tenant or property may not be communicated timely to the homeowner by the management company resulting in frustrated tenants and the possible loss of rental income many management companies job out repairs to parties that pay them kickbacks to receive their job referrals the result is higher repair costs or substandard repairs why investing in singlefamily properties is not profitable   the ideal tenant does not exist per the prospectus prospective tenants are required to undergo background checks that include income verification employment history criminal record check incometorent ratios and credit score but the prospectus also states we expect that the residential rental market will continue to grow driven in significant part by distressed owners who are displaced and converted to renters and that many displaced homeowners will prefer to live in singlefamily rentals with similar characteristics and amenities to their former houses there is a reason this person could not afford to pay their mortgage they either lost their job they owed more than their home was worth and walked away or they lacked money management skills in any case they likely have a poor credit score these individuals would likely not qualify to rent out an apartment so they would likely not qualify as a suitable tenant even though this is supposedly the target market   there is a reason these homes are vacant in the first place the portfolio of homes is located in states with some of the highest unemployment this is per the chart from the bureau of labor statistics bls the bls statistics do not take into account the real unemployment rate as well as the number of underemployed shadow stats provides a better indicator of the unemployment rate but unfortunately a breakdown by state was not available   dilution of shares is coming per the k shares distributed or issued to two harbors nysetwo stockholders or prior provident investors are subject to a lockup period expiring march   following such expirations these shares will be freely transferable without restriction the total number of shares that will become available from the two entities above as well as a few other entities will total  million the current outstanding shares are  million this will create a dilution of approximately  to the current shareholders   decentralized business operations create internal control issues running a decentralized business model to service single family properties will create various opportunities for fraud for example unneeded or overbilled repairs could be performed by the third party vendors as discussed above many management companies receive kickbacks from vendors to perform repair and maintenance work this would go unnoticed by management of the company the management company may also own or have available singlefamily homes for lease from other clients that may offer payments to steer tenants to their units overhead is also higher as the management company will expend more time and expenses in traveling to various units within a metropolitan area to service and repair the companys homes mow the yards etc per the k we are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with section  we may not be able to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion during the evaluation and testing process if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective the key is costly and challenging these are overhead costs that are not burdensome to a momand pop outfit these costs will likely increase as this decentralized business model will require more controls to provide reasonable assurance of compliance   crowded market limits margins other firms like blackstone have purchased a larger number of homes with the same idea as silver bay in addition small mom and pop investors will also have established tenants in their areas this competition will pressure profit margins as rent increases will be minimized the supply of rental properties will also increase as more potential tenants minimize costs by moving in together or renting out rooms   paying with cash exposes asset portfolio to inflation blackstones strategy was to obtain loans to finance home purchases with their economy of scale and credit rating this loan was likely at a very low longterm interest rate this was a smart strategy as inflationary pressures should push interest rates and consequently home prices and rents down but would also make the loan cheaper to service from increased revenue from their other revenue streams that rise with inflation buying homes for cash provides no such hedge against future price and rent decreases   rents will not be able to keep up with inflation leases that run one year or longer will be unable to keep up with the price increases that occur more frequently in other consumer goods as tenants spend more on food and energy they will find less money available for rent they will likely move back in with family or friends   no exit strategy when interest rates go up the ability to sell homes will become very difficult the supply of potential buyers will shrink forcing real estate prices as well as rent down this will result in the company either selling properties into the market at a significant loss or renting below the amount expected lowering or eliminating profits investment strategy investors should stay away from the us property market in general and silver bay in particular sby is particularly toxic due to its naked exposure to singlefamily residential real estate however there is always the possibility that the us economy will come roaring back through the continual printing of paper money and growth of debt at permanently low interest rates in addition maybe the government will buy back the portfolio from the company should this next housing bubble pop disclosure i have no positions in any stocks mentioned

expected to close by the end of q  highlights of the transaction include  transformational acquisition for tricon that will create the fourth largest publiclyowned singlefamily rental sfr company in the us with a focus on the us sun belt and the middle market combination of two geographically complementary sfr portfolios is expected to unlock substantial operating benefits and efficiencies expected to be accretive to tricons earnings per share and net asset value per share driven by the expected strong funds from operations profile home price appreciation and cost synergies provides a catalyst for tricons strategy to simplify its business model by focusing on scale and industry leadership in select housing verticals  tricon will host an investor conference call to discuss the acquisition today at  pm et gary berman tricons president and chief executive officer commented the proposed acquisition of silver bay is an incredibly exciting and transformational event for tricon this acquisition will more than double the size of tricon american homes establishing it as the fourth largest publiclyowned sfr company in the us silver bays highquality and well managed portfolio of sfr homes is a natural complement to our tah assets in particular given the geographic overlap in the sun belt we believe that the transaction will result in significant operating and overhead synergies creating immediate value for our shareholders in conjunction with the acquisition we also intend to exit our smaller noncore businesses and take a meaningful step toward simplifying our overall corporate business model by focusing on scale industry leadership enhanced disclosure and operational integration across our investment verticals detailed transaction highlights enhanced scale in high growth target markets following the acquisition the companys tricon american homes tah vertical will rank as the fourth largest publiclyowned sfr owneroperator in the us with over  homes at closing the combined company will operate in  markets including six markets with at least  homes and ten markets with at least  homes resulting in enhanced scale and market density that is expected to drive meaningful operating cost savings the combined portfolio will have a strategic focus on the high growth us sun belt with approximately  of silver bays homes located in tahs existing markets the combination will position tah among sfr industry leaders with compelling operational metrics across key performance indicators established leader in the middle market rental segment the transaction enhances tahs position as the leading sfr operator focused on the middle market as both tah and silver bay have focused their portfolios on this segment the middle market consists of approximately  million rental households that in the opinion of management tend to be stable longerterm renters this trend is evident in tahs and silver bays combined portfolio turnover rate of  for the twelve month period ended december   as compared to turnover for sector peers of  management expects a lower turnover ratio to result in lower operating costs and therefore enhanced financial performance over time  opportunity for meaningful cost rationalization transaction synergies are expected to be recognized through two primary channels i propertylevel efficiencies arising from enhanced operating scale in each market which management estimates will add approximately  bps to silver bays net operating income margin of approximately  for the full year of  and ii general and administrative expense synergies through the elimination of corporatelevel redundancies silver bay public reporting costs and back office overhead expenses which management estimates to be approximately  million per annum in aggregate  simplifying tricons business model the acquisition provides an opportunity for tricon to further simplify and streamline its business model management believes that it can maximize shareholder value by focusing its efforts on complementary residential real estate verticals where tricon can gain meaningful scale and be an industry leader while generating attractive riskadjusted returns for its shareholders in this regard tricon will be pursuing an orderly exit of its tricon lifestyle communities manufactured housing land lease business after completing its existing valueadd business plan as well as disposing of its us multifamily development assets upon their stabilization management has made the decision to exit these verticals because of the current challenges it faces in building effective scale and the prospect of better return opportunities in its core businesses going forward tricon will remain focused on growing its core investment verticals of tricon american homes tricon housing partners and tricon luxury residences  canada all of which are well positioned for longterm leadership in their respective industry sectors  transaction terms the transaction is structured as a merger of a subsidiary of tah and silver bay upon completion of the merger silver bay shareholders will receive  in cash per silver bay share for each outstanding share of common stock held immediately prior to the closing of the merger which represents a  premium to silver bays day volumeweighted average trading price as of february   the members of the board of directors of silver
