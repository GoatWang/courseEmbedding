manhattan co menu “we buy businesses for our clients rather than stocks which represent pieces of paper we do extensive research on every investment before we decide to make a commitment the reason for this is because our intended holding period is a very long time we want to be convinced that these are understandable businesses with strong management a good longterm record of profitability and a favorable industry environment that will allow for continued growth” our investment approach portfolio management is both art and science as valueoriented longterm investors we believe the discipline calls for fundamental research thorough accountingoriented financial analysis and the exercise of sound judgment to that end we feel it is important that our portfolio managers have research backgrounds and devote substantial amounts of time to personally generating and examining investment ideas while each first manhattan portfolio manager is empowered to make his or her own decisions about how to invest clients’ capital there are certain investing principles we share we seek to practice transparency and accountability we believe that it’s important to know exactly what’s in your portfolio and why it’s there we primarily invest in publicly traded companies that we can analyze thoroughly we can explain to any client why we have bought a particular stock and why we continue to hold it look for unrealized value as portfolio managers we seek to find and invest in undervalued businesses at attractive prices these companies are often trading at a “discount” to their intrinsic value due to temporary issues that lead to a market overreaction align with the exceptional we do not aim to replicate the broader market instead we seek to own a select group of companies with proven track records of shareholder value creation ensure that intensive and thorough research drives our decisionmaking above all preserving client capital is our numberone priority that is why we take a decidedly indepth approach when considering any new investment emphasizing a detailed understanding of the company’s fundamental business financial prospects and management quality to gather information we often spend weeks visiting a company’s facilities meeting with senior management and speaking to their customers we seek companies that generate strong cash flow have a responsible level of debt relative to their industry and have managements that deploy capital in a shareholderfriendly way strongly believe in the power of taxefficient lower friction compounding we strive to minimize changes in a portfolio in order to limit capital gains taxes for our taxable clients to that end we look to invest in companies with strong and understandable underlying businesses leading competitive positioning and long runways for future growth we tend to own these companies for an extended period of time enabling our clients to reap the benefits of compounding value of their
