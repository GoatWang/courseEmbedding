is projected to grow significantly in the years ahead as municipal entities and residential real estate stoke demand my opinion on the ipo is a cautious buy company forterra is the new name for a group of building products companies that have been acquired and combined by large private equity firm lone star funds the company serves most us and eastern canadian markets via its  manufacturing facilities and  employees forterras motto is the first mile to the last mile which means it covers the water infrastructure grid for residential nonresidential and infrastructure markets company ceo is jeffrey bradley who has been with the firm since september  and was previously ceo of globe specialty metals forterra has two presidents who oversee the two companys two main divisions mark carpenter president drainage pipe  products william kerfin president water pipe  products technology the company manufactures water drainage structural and storm water pipe and management systems product families include drainage pipe  products water pipe  products structural  specialty products storm water management systems thus the companys products range from large diameter piping that delivers water from treatment centers manages drainage along transportation corridors and smaller diameter pipe that delivers potable water to endusers below is a brief video from forterra source forterra youtube forterra claims to be the largest producer of concrete drainage pipe and precast products by sales volume in the united states and eastern canada market the us market size for drainage and water transmission pipes is estimated to be  billion by  representing  per year growth according to a report by freedonia group per the report most of the demand will come from municipal end uses while building construction will be the fastestgrowing segment interestingly the study says that the best opportunities by product will be found in the dominant and fastestgrowing plastic pipe segment forterra also cites an improving picture for us residential housing starts after a year low experienced in the wake of the  financial crisis and real estate crash source us census bureauforterra s filing an additional source of support for the large market opportunity was in december  when the us federal government enacted the fixing americas surface transportation act or the fast act which authorized  billion of funding over five years to upgrade transportationrelated infrastructure most of which pertains to highway spending this source of funding positively impacts the companys drainage pipe  products business which is a function of new highway construction and existing highway improvement projects an even greater potential market size was explored in the  report by the us conference of mayors  mayors water council the report anticipated a year spending need for water infrastructure of  trillion assuming a midrange growth rate of  competition direct competitors differ depending on the product segment but include the following companies rinker materialscemex nysecx oldcastle lafargeholcim holnf mcwane american castiron pipe company thompson pipe group as a result of forterras active acquisition history which includes seven acquisitions in the past three years the company is one of the few market participants of scale and several other competitors are significantly smaller in size acquisitions have been both tuckin and transformative and have added to the companys potential investment value of being able to provide significant exposure to the twin markets of drainage pipe  products and water pipe  products below is a chart showing the combined  results by segment and end market source forterra s filing the chart indicates an almost even distribution between drainage and water transmission segments and a diversified end market division of revenues financials forterras recent financials present a picture best summarized as increasing revenues likely due to its acquisitions increasing though uneven gross margins variable cash flow from operations high total debt below are the companys predecessor and successor operational results

shares at a midpoint price range of  per share a total of  million shares will be outstanding after the ipo assuming the underwriters purchase all options available to them the company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for the following items  million to repay outstanding indebtedness under its junior term loan  million to repay outstanding indebtedness under its senior term loan  million to pay a prepayment penalty for its junior term loan the remainder  million for working capital and general corporate purposes upon completion of the offering private equity firm lone star funds through its indirect interest in sole shareholder forterra us holdings llc will still own  of the outstanding common stock and may not sell its shares for a period of  days after the effective date of the prospectus the normal and customary lockup period no other shareholders will be directly selling in the ipo although company directors and executives own interests in forterra us holdings which is the only selling shareholder goldman sachs is the lead left underwriter credit suisse is also a joint bookrunning manager and has conflicts of interest due to its existing loans to the company commentary forterra appears to be the culmination of an acquisition rollup effort by private equity firm lone star funds with the goal of developing a water infrastructure powerhouse as the us and canada have significant deferred water infrastructure projects the company appears to be perfectly placed to take advantage of recent funding legislation and significant need for municipal water project maintenance and replacement additionally as the residential real estate market continues its steady rebound after the financial crisis and real estate crash of  forterra appears to be well positioned to take advantage of that growth of course much of this growth potential is dependent on the continued lowinterest rate environment enabling government budget expenditures and private industry residential real estate development valuing a combination like forterra which is growing as a result of its acquisition success presents a challenge pricesales a pricesales multiple for a comparable basket of building materials companies is approximately x given forterras significant revenue growth which is partly a function of its recent acquisition history and cant continue indefinitely and due to its favorable diversification between drainage and water segments i would assign it a pricesales multiple of x  annual revenue run rate of  billion x pricesales multiple of    billion valuation evsales assuming a  billion enterprise value the resulting evsales multiple would be x im only cautiously optimistic about the ipo because its an unknown as to how well the company can drive toward profitability after digesting so many acquisitions over the past three years also sales growth once the acquisitions have come to an end will need to be entirely organic in nature and the company has not yet proven itself as to its ability to grow organically since the company is proposing to value itself at approximately  billion i would consider the ipo a cautious buy i write
