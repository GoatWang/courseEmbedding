as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of the sum of its net assets and the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and ohio personal income tax these municipal bonds include obligations issued by the state of ohio and its subdivisions authorities instrumentalities and corporations as well as obligations issued by us territories such as puerto rico the us virgin islands and guam that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and ohio personal income tax the fund may invest without limit in securities that generate income subject to the alternative minimum tax the fund will generally maintain under normal market conditions an investment portfolio with an overall weighted average maturity in excess of  years under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets in investment grade municipal bonds rated bbbbaa or higher at the time of purchase by at least one independent rating agency or if unrated judged by the funds subadviser to be of comparable quality the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in below investment grade municipal bonds commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds the fund may invest in all types of municipal bonds including general obligation bonds revenue bonds and participation interests in municipal leases the fund may invest in zero coupon bonds which are issued at substantial discounts from their value at maturity and pay no cash income to their holders until they mature the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest payments vary inversely with changes in shortterm taxexempt interest rates inverse floaters inverse floaters are derivative securities that provide leveraged exposure to underlying municipal bonds the funds investments in inverse floaters are designed to increase the funds income and returns through this leveraged exposure these investments are speculative however and also create the possibility that income and returns will be diminished the fund may utilize futures contracts swap contracts options on futures contracts and options on swap contracts in an attempt to manage market risk credit risk and yield curve risk and to manage the effective maturity or duration of securities in the funds portfolio the funds subadviser uses a valueoriented strategy and looks for higheryielding and undervalued longterm municipal bonds that offer aboveaverage total return the subadviser may choose to sell municipal bonds with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other available bonds principal risks the price and yield of this fund will change daily you could lose money by investing in the fund an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance       nuveen corporation or any other government agency the principal risks of investing in the fund listed alphabetically include alternative minimum tax riskthe fund has no limit as to the amount that can be invested in alternative minimum tax bonds therefore all or a portion of the funds otherwise exemptinterest dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal alternative minimum tax call riskif an issuer calls higheryielding debt instruments held by the fund performance could be adversely impacted credit riskcredit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments the funds investments in inverse floaters will increase the funds credit risk credit spread riskcredit spread risk is the risk that credit spreads ie the difference in yield between securities that is due to differences in their credit quality may increase when the market believes that bonds generally have a greater risk of default increasing credit spreads may reduce the market values of the funds debt securities credit spreads often increase more for lower rated and unrated securities than for investment grade securities in addition when credit spreads increase reductions in market value will generally be greater for longermaturity securities cybersecurity riskcybersecurity breaches may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to fund assets customer data or proprietary information or cause the fund andor its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality derivatives riskthe use of derivatives involves additional risks and transaction costs which could leave the fund in a worse position than if it had not used these instruments derivative instruments can be used to acquire or to transfer the risk and returns of a security or other asset without buying or selling the security or asset these instruments may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest as a result a small investment in derivatives can result in losses that greatly exceed the original investment derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value an overthecounter derivative transaction between the fund and a counterparty that is not cleared through a central counterparty also involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the contract to make required payments the payment obligation for a cleared derivative transaction is guaranteed by a central counterparty which exposes the fund to the creditworthiness of the central counterparty high yield securities riskhigh yield securities which are rated below investment grade and commonly referred to as junk bonds are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the fund they generally have greater credit risk are less liquid and have more volatile prices than investment grade securities income riskthe funds income could decline during periods of falling interest rates or when the fund experiences defaults on debt securities it holds also if the fund invests in inverse floaters the funds income may decrease if shortterm interest rates rise interest rate riskinterest rate risk is the risk that the value of the funds portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates the fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates and the effect of potential government fiscal policy initiatives and resulting market reaction to those initiatives when interest rates change the values of longerduration debt securities usually change more than the values of shorterduration debt securities interest rate risk may be increased by the funds investment in inverse floaters because of the leveraged nature of these investments inverse floaters riskthe use of inverse floaters by the fund creates effective leverage due to the leveraged nature of these investments they will typically be more volatile and involve greater risk than the fixed rate municipal bonds underlying the inverse floaters an investment in certain inverse floaters will involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment distributions on inverse floaters bear an inverse relationship to shortterm municipal bond interest rates thus distributions paid to the fund on its inverse floaters will be reduced or even eliminated as shortterm municipal interest rates rise and will increase when shortterm municipal interest rates fall inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment municipal bond market liquidity riskinventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years lessening their ability to make a market in these securities this reduction in market making capacity has the potential to decrease the funds ability to buy or sell bonds and increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress in addition recent federal   nuveen    banking regulations may cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of municipal bonds which may further decrease the funds ability to buy or sell bonds as a result the fund may be forced to accept a lower price to sell a security to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on performance if the fund needed to sell large blocks of bonds to raise cash such as to meet heavy shareholder redemptions those sales could further reduce the bonds prices and hurt performance municipal lease obligations riskparticipation interests in municipal leases pose special risks because many leases and contracts contain nonappropriation clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body municipal securities riskthe values of municipal securities held by the fund may be adversely affected by local political and economic conditions and developments adverse conditions in an industry significant to a local economy could have a correspondingly adverse effect on the financial condition of local issuers because the fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from ohio or us territories such as puerto rico the fund is more susceptible to adverse economic political or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations certain municipal bond issuers in puerto rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades tax riskincome from municipal bonds held by the fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer investments in certain derivatives utilized by the fund may cause the fund to have taxable investment income valuation riskthe debt securities in which the fund invests typically are valued by a pricing service utilizing a range of marketbased inputs and assumptions including readily available market quotations obtained from brokerdealers making markets in such instruments cash flows and transactions for comparable instruments there is no assurance that the fund will be able to sell a portfolio security at the price established by the pricing service which could result in a loss to the fund pricing services generally price debt securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size but some trades may occur in smaller odd lot sizes often at lower prices than institutional round lot trades different pricing services may incorporate different assumptions and inputs into their valuation methodologies potentially resulting in different values for the same securities as a result if the fund were to change pricing services or if the funds pricing service were to change its valuation methodology there could be a material impact either positive or negative on the funds net asset value zero coupon bonds riskzero coupon bonds do not pay interest on a current basis and may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall in addition while such bonds generate income for purposes of generally accepted accounting standards they do not generate cash flow and thus could cause the fund to be forced to liquidate securities at an inopportune time in order to distribute cash as required by tax laws fund

buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of the sum of its net assets and the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and wisconsin personal income tax these municipal bonds include obligations issued by the state of wisconsin and its subdivisions authorities instrumentalities and corporations as well as obligations issued by us territories such as puerto rico the us virgin islands and guam that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and wisconsin personal income tax the fund may invest without limit in securities that generate income subject to the alternative minimum tax the fund will generally maintain under normal market conditions an investment portfolio with an overall weighted average maturity in excess of  years under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets in investment grade municipal bonds rated bbbbaa or higher at the time of purchase by at least one independent rating agency or if unrated judged by the funds subadviser to be of comparable quality the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in below investment grade municipal bonds commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds the fund may invest in all types of municipal bonds including general obligation bonds revenue bonds and participation interests in municipal leases the fund may invest in zero coupon bonds which are issued at substantial discounts from their value at maturity and pay no cash income to their holders until they mature the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest payments vary inversely with changes in shortterm taxexempt interest rates inverse floaters inverse floaters are derivative securities that provide leveraged exposure to underlying municipal bonds the funds investments in inverse floaters are designed to increase the funds income and returns through this leveraged exposure these investments are speculative however and also create the possibility that income and returns will be diminished the fund may utilize futures contracts swap contracts options on futures contracts and options on swap contracts in an attempt to manage market risk credit risk and yield curve risk and to manage the effective maturity or duration of securities in the funds portfolio the funds subadviser uses a valueoriented strategy and looks for higheryielding and undervalued longterm municipal bonds that offer aboveaverage total return the subadviser may choose to sell municipal bonds with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other available bonds       nuveen investments principal risks the price and yield of this fund will change daily you could lose money by investing in the fund an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the principal risks of investing in the fund listed alphabetically include alternative minimum tax riskthe fund has no limit as to the amount that can be invested in alternative minimum tax bonds therefore all or a portion of the funds otherwise exemptinterest dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal alternative minimum tax call riskif an issuer calls higheryielding debt instruments held by the fund performance could be adversely impacted credit riskcredit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments the funds investments in inverse floaters will increase the funds credit risk credit spread riskcredit spread risk is the risk that credit spreads ie the difference in yield between securities that is due to differences in their credit quality may increase when the market believes that bonds generally have a greater risk of default increasing credit spreads may reduce the market values of the funds securities credit spreads often increase more for lower rated and unrated securities than for investment grade securities in addition when credit spreads increase reductions in market value will generally be greater for longermaturity securities cybersecurity riskcybersecurity breaches may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to fund assets customer data or proprietary information or cause the fund andor its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality derivatives riskthe use of derivatives involves additional risks and transaction costs which could leave the fund in a worse position than if it had not used these instruments derivative instruments can be used to acquire or to transfer the risk and returns of a security or other asset without buying or selling the security or asset these instruments may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest as a result a small investment in derivatives can result in losses that greatly exceed the original investment derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value a derivative transaction also involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the contract to make required payments high yield securities riskhigh yield securities which are rated below investment grade and commonly referred to as junk bonds are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the fund they generally have greater credit risk are less liquid and have more volatile prices than investment grade securities income riskthe funds income could decline during periods of falling interest rates also if the fund invests in inverse floaters the funds income may decrease if shortterm interest rates rise interest rate riskinterest rate risk is the risk that the value of the funds portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates the fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates and the effect of potential government fiscal policy initiatives and resulting market reaction to those initiatives when interest rates change the values of longerduration debt securities usually change more than the values of shorterduration debt securities interest rate risk may be increased by the funds investment in inverse floaters because of the leveraged nature of these investments inverse floaters riskthe use of inverse floaters by the fund creates effective leverage due to the leveraged nature of these investments they will typically be more volatile and involve greater risk than the fixed rate municipal bonds underlying the inverse floaters an investment in certain inverse floaters will involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment distributions on inverse floaters bear an inverse relationship to shortterm municipal bond interest rates thus distributions paid to the fund on its inverse floaters will be reduced or even eliminated as shortterm municipal interest rates rise and will increase when shortterm municipal interest rates fall inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment municipal bond market liquidity riskinventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years lessening their ability to make a market in these securities this reduction in market making capacity has the potential to decrease the funds ability to buy or sell bonds and increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress in addition recent federal   nuveen investments    banking regulations may cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of municipal bonds which may further decrease the funds ability to buy or sell bonds as a result the fund may be forced to accept a lower price to sell a security to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on performance if the fund needed to sell large blocks of bonds to raise cash such as to meet heavy shareholder redemptions those sales could further reduce the bonds prices and hurt performance municipal lease obligations riskparticipation interests in municipal leases pose special risks because many leases and contracts contain nonappropriation clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body political and economic risksthe values of municipal securities held by the fund may be adversely affected by local political and economic conditions and developments adverse conditions in an industry significant to a local economy could have a correspondingly adverse effect on the financial condition of local issuers because the fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from wisconsin or us territories such as puerto rico the fund is more susceptible to adverse economic political or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations certain municipal bond issuers in puerto rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades tax riskincome from municipal bonds held by the fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer investments in certain derivatives utilized by the fund may cause the fund to have taxable investment income valuation riskthe debt securities in which the fund invests typically are valued by a pricing service utilizing a range of marketbased inputs and assumptions including readily available market quotations obtained from brokerdealers making markets in such instruments cash flows and transactions for comparable instruments there is no assurance that the fund will be able to sell a portfolio security at the price established by the pricing service which could result in a loss to the fund pricing services generally price debt securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size but some trades may occur in smaller odd lot sizes often at lower prices than institutional round lot trades zero coupon bonds riskzero coupon bonds do not pay interest on a current basis and may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall in addition while such bonds generate income for purposes of generally accepted accounting standards they do not generate cash flow and thus could cause the fund to be forced to liquidate securities at an inopportune time in order to distribute cash as required by tax laws fund performance the following bar chart and table provide some indication of the potential risks of investing in the fund the funds past

over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of the sum of its net assets and the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and ohio personal income tax these municipal bonds include obligations issued by the state of ohio and its subdivisions authorities instrumentalities and corporations as well as obligations issued by us territories such as puerto rico the us virgin islands and guam that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and ohio personal income tax the fund may invest without limit in securities that generate income subject to the alternative minimum tax the fund will generally maintain under normal market conditions an investment portfolio with an overall weighted average maturity in excess of  years under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets in investment grade municipal bonds rated bbbbaa or higher at the time of purchase by at least one independent rating agency or if unrated judged by the funds subadviser to be of comparable quality the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in below investment grade municipal bonds commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds the fund may invest in all types of municipal bonds including general obligation bonds revenue bonds and participation interests in municipal leases the fund may invest in zero coupon bonds which are issued at substantial discounts from their value at maturity and pay no cash income to their holders until they mature the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest payments vary inversely with changes in shortterm taxexempt interest rates  inverse floaters  inverse floaters are derivative securities that provide leveraged exposure to underlying municipal bonds the funds investments in inverse floaters are designed to increase the funds income and returns through this leveraged exposure these investments are speculative however and also create the possibility that income and returns will be diminished the fund may utilize futures contracts swap contracts options on futures contracts and options on swap contracts in an attempt to manage market risk credit risk and yield curve risk and to manage the effective maturity or duration of securities in the funds portfolio the funds subadviser uses a valueoriented strategy and looks for higheryielding and undervalued longterm municipal bonds that offer aboveaverage total return the subadviser may choose to sell municipal bonds with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other available bonds       nuveen investments principal risks the price and yield of this fund will change daily you could lose money by investing in the fund an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the principal risks of investing in the fund listed alphabetically include alternative minimum tax risk the fund has no limit as to the amount that can be invested in alternative minimum tax bonds therefore all or a portion of the funds otherwise exemptinterest dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal alternative minimum tax call risk if an issuer calls higheryielding debt instruments held by the fund performance could be adversely impacted credit risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments the funds investments in inverse floaters will increase the funds credit risk credit spread risk credit spread risk is the risk that credit spreads ie the difference in yield between securities that is due to differences in their credit quality may increase when the market believes that bonds generally have a greater risk of default increasing credit spreads may reduce the market values of the funds securities credit spreads often increase more for lower rated and unrated securities than for investment grade securities in addition when credit spreads increase reductions in market value will generally be greater for longermaturity securities cybersecurity risk cybersecurity breaches may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to fund assets customer data or proprietary information or cause the fund andor its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality derivatives risk the use of derivatives involves additional risks and transaction costs which could leave the fund in a worse position than if it had not used these instruments derivative instruments can be used to acquire or to transfer the risk and returns of a security or other asset without buying or selling the security or asset these instruments may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest as a result a small investment in derivatives can result in losses that greatly exceed the original investment derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value a derivative transaction also involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the contract to make required payments high yield securities risk high yield securities which are rated below investment grade and commonly referred to as junk bonds are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the fund they generally have greater credit risk are less liquid and have more volatile prices than investment grade securities income risk the funds income could decline during periods of falling interest rates also if the fund invests in inverse floaters the funds income may decrease if shortterm interest rates rise interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the funds portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates the fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates and the effect of potential government fiscal policy initiatives and resulting market reaction to those initiatives when interest rates change the values of longerduration debt securities usually change more than the values of shorterduration debt securities interest rate risk may be increased by the funds investment in inverse floaters because of the leveraged nature of these investments inverse floaters risk the use of inverse floaters by the fund creates effective leverage due to the leveraged nature of these investments they will typically be more volatile and involve greater risk than the fixed rate municipal bonds underlying the inverse floaters an investment in certain inverse floaters will involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment distributions on inverse floaters bear an inverse relationship to shortterm municipal bond interest rates thus distributions paid to the fund on its inverse floaters will be reduced or even eliminated as shortterm municipal interest rates rise and will increase when shortterm municipal interest rates fall inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment municipal bond market liquidity risk inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years lessening their ability to make a market in these securities this reduction in market making capacity has the potential to decrease the funds ability to buy or sell bonds and increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress in addition recent federal   nuveen investments    banking regulations may cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of municipal bonds which may further decrease the funds ability to buy or sell bonds as a result the fund may be forced to accept a lower price to sell a security to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on performance if the fund needed to sell large blocks of bonds to raise cash such as to meet heavy shareholder redemptions those sales could further reduce the bonds prices and hurt performance municipal lease obligations risk participation interests in municipal leases pose special risks because many leases and contracts contain nonappropriation clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body political and economic risks the values of municipal securities held by the fund may be adversely affected by local political and economic conditions and developments adverse conditions in an industry significant to a local economy could have a correspondingly adverse effect on the financial condition of local issuers because the fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from ohio or us territories such as puerto rico the fund is more susceptible to adverse economic political or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations certain municipal bond issuers in puerto rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades tax risk income from municipal bonds held by the fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer investments in certain derivatives utilized by the fund may cause the fund to have taxable investment income valuation risk the debt securities in which the fund invests typically are valued by a pricing service utilizing a range of marketbased inputs and assumptions including readily available market quotations obtained from brokerdealers making markets in such instruments cash flows and transactions for comparable instruments there is no assurance that the fund will be able to sell a portfolio security at the price established by the pricing service which could result in a loss to the fund pricing services generally price debt securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size but some trades may occur in smaller odd lot sizes often at lower prices than institutional round lot trades zero coupon bonds risk zero coupon bonds do not pay interest on a current basis and may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall in addition while such bonds generate income for purposes of generally accepted accounting standards they do not generate cash flow and thus could cause the fund to be forced to liquidate securities at an inopportune time in order to distribute cash as required by tax laws fund performance
