lenses would be so unbalanced   i tried wearing one hard contact and one soft lens but it seemed to just make me dizzy and gave me double vision when it wasn’t moving around all over the place so id been getting by with basically one eye recently i noticed i had trouble seeing the score in the wildcat games on tv and i have a big tv not that the scores were anything to brag about right theni noticed that my good eye seemed to be getting more achey and tired as time went on both eyes would water when i tried to squint at the tv – and no it wasn’t because of the scorei was petrified about eye surgery but knew i couldn’t keep straining my eyes any longer so i finally pulled up my big boy pants and called to schedule the appointment for the initial consultation which was free by the way  dr dudee evaluated me and he was thorough and patient in explaining to me the condition of my eye my options etc  he never seemed rushed or uninterested  he talked to me in detail to make sure my expectations were realistic  the really bad eye needed prk and my other eye was ok for lasik i knew immediately that i wanted to go ahead with the surgery and that he was the doctor to do it  i had both procedures on the same day the prk eye took a bit longer to get its proper vision but the final outcome was mindblowing i saw things i never knew i wasn’t seeing before a few weeks after the surgery i got my corrective lenses restriction taken of my driver license  jitander dudee md medical visionkevindewitt ratedi did my research both on the internet and talking to some doctor friends and short listed a few places including dr dudee  a few weeks later a friend told me she just had her eyelids done by dr dudee and she looked great so i decided to seize the day and went in to have my lasik evaluation when she had her postop visiti honestly didn’t know there was so much information to take in about the procedure i am type a and like to be fully informed i watched the video and read the fine print very carefully jennifer the lasik nurse was very thorough and friendly she ran a number of tests questioned history etc  then i met dr dudee and he continued the same but explained the two different options between prk and lasik  fast forward a week later  the actual procedure was very short and easy  dr dudee and his staff made everything wonderfully efficient and not scary i now have a  vision  i know because i check it at home did i tell you i was type a im so grateful for it thanks dr dudee staffjitander dudee md medical visionkevindewitt ratedi truly appreciate the professionalism the office offers and will be sending anyone and everyone to dr dudee’s office for their vision correction needs if you are looking to get lasik eye surgery your search stops here after so many years of wearing glasses and contacts im finally free and all thanks to him he made the entire process feel very comfortable and everyone in his staff is wonderful  my mom had cataract surgery by dr dudee my husband had prk and my procedure was a couple weeks later with lasik i’m usually too busy or lazy to do reviews but your vision is important so if your eyes are in trouble and you need real expertise this is the place to godudde jitander mdkevindewitt ratedi had been thinking about lasik but putting it off for years and years even though my eyes were in horrible shape i had big time astigmatism in both eyes and my eyes have always been soooo dry  i couldn’t even wear the daily disposable contacts  i admit i had abused them when i was young and foolish thru my s but still didnt look into lasik until my mid s due to fear dr dudee and his staff really took me by the hand and treated me gently boy do i wish i’d done it earlier it was quick and painless and now i have wonderful vision – especially for night driving something that my job depends on i feel a whole lot better much safer and am so thankfulwoods robert drpamula d ratedi went to this doctor twice because i thought the first time he was just having a bad day the second time i went there he literally had me in tears he told me in a stern voice to be quiet that he did not like people that ask too many questions i do not know how doctors are allowed to practice that are so rude and how do they know whats going on with the patient un less the patient and dr have communication  if you must see this doctor for any reason please do not let him treat you in a negative way stand up to him because that is exactly what i wish i had donedudde jitander mdashleywhite ratedi got my procedure done about a year ago as a valentines giftthe procedure itself took about  mins i want to say the doctor is friendly he has a good personality and answers all your questions he explains everything as he is doing it which is really helpful right after the procedure you do not see  i didnt at least i remember my eyes started stinging like i was cutting onions but i couldnt touch my eyes  when i got home i went to sleep for  hrs and when i woke up things were still a bit foggy but i could see my boyfriend still looks hot lolmazloomdoost camellia s mdlinda m ratedi have been a patient of dr danesh

has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or

call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback sarah g smith  new york ny

this product by jennifer stires jul   sarah bishop this short story was one of the best ive ever read it had me on the edge of my seat until the very last word jennifer wwwjennswritingscom and wwwlulucomjstires report as inappropriate by kimberly steele may   sarah is an entertaining blast of a storymorality play sarah bishop grabbed me from the preview the obnoxious  year young egomaniac ryan mathers is someone weve all met before in our own lives ryan relishes his own youth and revels in his ability to seduce young women even jailbait young women like his  year old amour laura who he knocks up by mistake and then dumps the poor girl waxes psychotic over dashing ryan and its the dark enigmatic sarah bishop who enters the scene sometimes transparent the storyline becomes obvious when sarah takes ryan for a ride in her car and there is a pacifier sitting on the passenger seat i would have preferred a more subtle foreshadowing but the strength of the story is that it is fastpaced and fun like a lost episode of tales from the crypt or an old twilight zone i think that this story begs to be in a collection of short horror stories or a series of sarah bishop tales its a
