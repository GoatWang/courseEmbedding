bcalculator tool will you have enoughorange money® for retirement tool as a component of benefits offered to employees k plans are a very popular way to accumulate taxdeferred income and earnings for retirement  employers offer k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement you choose how much pretax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the k plan your retirement savings can continue to grow taxdeferred until you make a withdrawal you do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan generally if you take the distribution after age ½ there is no tax penalty   one difference from an ira is that k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer      key features because your employer sponsors the k plan there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals check your plan carefully the following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you optional participation although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations k plan participation is still optional check with your employer to determine how you can enroll  contribution rate you can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established irs limits you will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan your k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pretax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period that’s a good thing  available investments you can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer deferred taxes not only do your pretax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred note some plans offer a roth k which permit savings on an after tax basis   you will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal  optional employer match to provide an extra boost to retirement savings many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested  accessing funds during employment loans—as an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified irs limits hardship withdrawals—understanding that certain hardships arise the irs permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons  portability if you leave your job you can remain in the plan or rollover your k funds into an ira or another k support your k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals measure your progress and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals the  and b plans are similar to k plans but are typically offered by other types of organizations the  plan is offered to employees of state and local governments the b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified taxexempt organizations such as highereducation churches taxexempt hospitals and charities roth accounts may also be offered by a plan sponsor under k b or governmental b plans roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income but qualified distributions may be taken taxfree in retirement   suitable for the k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement   eligibility you must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a k plan to participate  if you leave employment you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan  some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave  you can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover ira or in most cases into the k plan offered by your new employer contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain irsdefined annual limits contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay the contributions are taken before taxes lowering your current income tax bill you will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan withdrawals prior to age ½ are also subject to a  irs early withdrawal penalty unless an irs exception applies  additional details this material is provided
