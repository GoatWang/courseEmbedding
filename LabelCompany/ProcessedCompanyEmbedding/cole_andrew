revolutionary and it would go on to become the most iconic of british rail locomotives their sleek design would become world famous and when introduced they were known as the high speed train or hst due to their top speed of mph  power cars were built with the last into traffic in when built they were all fitted with the distinctive paxman valenta engine but they have all been replaced with either paxman vp or mtu engines they have operated over all the former british rail regions although they were scarce on the southern currently it is mainly operated by great western east midlands trains virgin trains east coast grand central and cross country trains the great western and east coast trains already have their replacements on order and it remains to see how long they will remain
