conflicts run amok vrm i vrm ii and mvp mvp ii by craig mccann and regina meng introduction slcg has written extensively about pervasive conflicts of interest in nontraded reits arising because a nontraded reit’s sponsor advisor selling agents and major suppliers are often affiliated entities that benefit more from creating the nontraded reit than from running the reit profitably our blog posts can be found by clicking here slcg economists have also published peerreviewed articles on nontraded reits including an empirical analysis of nontraded reitsi available here a collection of realestate funds under common control based in las vegas nv epitomize the worst of nontraded reit abuses the real estate funds vestin realty mortgage i vestin realty mortgage ii mvp reit i and mvp reit ii are under the common control of michael shustek and indirectly lance bradford the abuses include selling loans to related parties in nonarms length transactions transferring liabilities to public investors through nonarms length transactions and transferring property among related entities at less than arms length vrm i vrm ii mvp reit i and mvp reit ii illustrate the perils of nontraded reits in which control persons can direct transactions for their benefit with little or no regard for the harm they cause retail investors the extreme disregard shown by control persons for investors in these registered investments also highlights the potential risks associated with proposals to allow easier sale of unregistered investments to retail investors mr shustek reaped  million by purchasing a loan from vrm ii in november  vestin realty mortgage ii vrm ii sold a  million loan due in january  to its ceo mr shustek for  million plus  of whatever mr shustek collected from the borrower beyond  million after expensesii in january  just two months after vrm ii sold the loan to mr shustek the borrower paid back the loan and vrm ii received an additional  million per the agreement that means mr shustek received at least  million from the borrower and kept at least  million for himself  million     million   million publicly available documents do not indicate whether vrm ii conducted any due diligence to confirm that the transaction was fair to vrm ii shareholders however mr shustek’s large windfall in two months the myriad conflicts of interest and the existence of other potential abuses of his power to control vrm ii raise questions about the legitimacy of this loan transaction the transaction stands out not only because it is an apparent abuse of his power but also because of its size in december  vrm ii only had  million of net assets meaning the transfer of at least  million from vrm ii to mr shustek was a significant loss for vrm ii investorsiii the influence and control of mr shustek and mr bradford mr shustek controls multiple companies including the vestin mortgage llc vestin realty mortgage i vrm i and vestin realty mortgage ii vrm ii mr shustek also owns mvp reit’s sponsor and one of mvp reit’s two selling agents figure  presents a simplified organizational chart of mr shustek’s influence over the related entities figure  mr

provides accounting services to vrm i vrm ii and mvp reitix the questionable nature of mr shustek’s and mr bradford’s dealings is alluded to in a february  article by a las vegas newspaperx mr shustek passed between  million and  million in costs on to vrm i and ii when mr shustek created mvp reit he structured the advisory agreement so mvp realty advisors would pay the upfront selling commissions and offering and organizational costs mvp realty advisors would then be recover its costs through acquisition fees and asset management fees when mvp reit began raising capital in september  mr shustek owned  of mvp realty advisors through mvp capital partners by december  mvp reit had only raised  million of capital suggesting the advisory agreement was going to be a negative net present value investment by december  vrm ii had lent and written off approximately  million to mvp realty advisors in december  mr shustek gave his  interest in mvp realty advisors to vrm i and vrm ii subsequently vrm i and vrm ii loaned mvp realty advisors  million and an additional  million respectivelyxi the loans were written off as uncollectable in the same quarter they were issued vrm ii might have loaned mvp realty advisors the additional  million anyway as vrm ii was already a  owner however the  million from vrm i would likely have come from mr shustek if he had retained his interest in effect mr shustek saved at least  million by passing his  interest in mvp realty advisors on to vrm i and vrm ii despite owing  million to vrm i and vrm ii mvp realty advisors waived  million of fee revenue and expense reimbursements from mvp reit by june  xii thus it appears vrm i and vrm ii could have avoided some uncertainty about being repaid by just requiring mvp reit to pay its bills both the nearimmediate impairment of large loans to mvp realty advisors and the waived revenue from mvp reit raise questions about conflicts of interest and abuses of power at vrm i and vrm ii the shustekbradford real estate funds vestin realty mortgage i previously vestin fund i and dm mortgage investors vestin realty mortgage i vrm i began as dm mortgage investors on march   dm

corporation which became vestin group and which owned the manager the sunderland corporation  vestin group route to becoming a publicly traded company is an interesting story a shell company sunderland acquisition corporation was registered by a washington dc lawyer on or about april   mr shustek and mr bradford are not mentioned in the registration statement which is available by clicking here two weeks later sunderland acquisition corporation acquired capsource del mar mortgage and del mar holdings changed its name to sunderland corporation and shortly thereafter to vestin group mr shustek was the majority owner and mr bradford was cfo mr bradford functioned as the cfo of dm mortgage investorsvestin fund ixiii he was also an executive of sunderland corporation mr bradford’s accounting firm provided services to vrm i and its predecessorsxiv vrm i was always a very small reit its market capitalization never reached  million at the end of  vrm i deregistered with the sec and moved from the nasdaq to the otc bulletin board vrm i’s total return from inception to april   was  during this same time period the total return to the ftse mortgage reit index was  see figure  figure  vestin realty mortgage i vrm i total return we have identified mvp i and mvp ii’s capital raise periods in figure  these nontraded reits discussed below were controlled by mr shustek any brokerage firm considering selling either mvp i or mvp ii could have seen that investors in mr shustek’s vrm i had fared very badly both in absolute terms and relative to a more diverse set of mortgage reits vestin realty mortgage ii previously vestin fund ii vestin fund ii registered up to  million shares at  per share on december   vestin fund ii’s registration statement is available by clicking here all vestin fund ii’s sec filings can be accessed by clicking here in may  vestin fund ii announced plans to convert to vestin realty trust ii instead in march  vestin fund ii merged into

  to april   was  during this same time period the total return to the ftse mortgage reit index was  see figure  figure  vestin realty mortgage ii vrm ii total return we have identified mvp i and mvp

terms and relative to a more diverse set of mortgage reits figure  and figure  don’t capture the full extent of investor losses due to mr shustek’s vrm i and vrm ii programs vrm ii had raised over  million net of redemptions before becoming vestin realty mortgage ii in  had those net amounts raised from investors been invested in a diversified portfolio of reits proxied for by vanguard’s vgsix fund the investments would have been worth approximately  million when the vrm ii shares were worth  million thereafter the vgsix shares that could have been purchased with the net amounts paid for vestin fund ii  vrm ii shares would have grown to be worth  billion while the vrm ii shares are worth  billion that is the vrm ii program has cost reit investors  billion see figure  figure  vestin fund ii  vestin realty mortgage ii vrm ii total return   mvp reit mvp reit is a nontraded reit sponsored by mvp capital partners llc and advised by mvp realty advisors llc mvp capital partners llc became owned by vrm i and vrm ii mvp reit’s sec filings are available by clicking here during three years of fundraising starting in september  mvp reit issued only  million of stock or  of its proposed  million offering most of the  million in mvp reit shares were issued to sere holdings controlled by mr bradford in exchange for interests in six buildings sere holdings then appears to have sold the shares to investors through a brokerage firm owned by mr shustek mvp reit ii mvp reit ii is a second nontraded reit from mvp capital partners it was registered in september  and sought to raise up to  million in a one year period as of september   the reit had only raised  million or  of its maximum offering amount the board of directors extended the close of offering from october   to december   and announced  million preferred stock offering after the closing date of common shares offering was determined mvp reit ii’s sec filings are available by clicking here entities affiliated with mr shustek and mr bradford repeatedly bought and sold the same properties from each other between june  and may  entities affiliated with mr shustek and mr bradford bought and sold the same six buildings from each other on three separate occasionsxix as of may  the net result of the repeated sales was a  million loss for vrm i and vrm ii plus commissions and closing costsxx the first sale between june  and november  sere holdings of which mr bradford was the managing member sold wolfpack properties llc building c llc building a llc devonshire llc se properties llc and execusuites llc to mvp reit for  million see table xxi each llc was a holding company for a single property as part of the transactions mvp reit paid  million in acquisition fees to mvp realty advisors a subsidiary of vrm iixxii table  summary of the transactions in round  mvp reit paid sere holdings for the buildings by issuing  million shares of common stock valued at  million and assuming the buildings’ mortgages  millionxxiii in december  just after sere holdings sold the last building to mvp reit the shares issued for the six buildings constituted  of all the equity capital raised by mvp reitxxiv interestingly by march  sere holdings had divested itself of  million shares of the nontraded mvp reit  of mvp reit’s shares outstandingxv without selling any of the shares back to mvp reit and without selling more than  to any single investor this is interesting because in less than nine months sere holdings sold more than  times the number of mvp shares that mvp reit had issued to other investors since the beginning of its capital raise  months earlier september  the second sale within one year of buying the six buildings from sere holdings mvp sold all six buildings to vrm i and vrm ii in return mvp received cash and interests in parking structures and storage facilities from vrm i and vrm iixxvi as shown in table  mvp sold the buildings to vrm i and vrm ii at mvp’s purchase price  million as part of the transaction mvp paid  million in expenses to vrm i and vrm iixxvii one odd aspect of the second sale is that it ever happened vrm i and vrm ii are mortgage reits meaning they invest primarily in mortgages rather than actual real estate after purchasing the properties  of vrm ii’s assets were tied up in real estate table  summary of the transactions in round  the third sale table  summarizes the third sale of the buildings between january  and may  vrm i and vrm ii sold the same six properties to companies owned and managed by stable development llc as part of the transactions vrm i and vrm ii paid  million in disposition fees to vestin mortgagexxviii stable development was owned by lance bradford who was also the managing member of sere holdingsxxix in other words after the third sale the properties belonged to the same person who sold them in the first round however despite rising values for office properties in las vegas see table xxx vrm i and vrm ii sold the properties back to an entity controlled by mr bradford for  million less than the  transaction prices table  summary of the transactions in round  table  capitalization rates for class a office property in las vegas nevada lower capitalization rates mean investors are willing to pay more for a building   repeatedly selling the six buildings makes little economic sense and looks more like a shell game than transactions with economic substance together the three rounds of buying and selling the properties transferred  million from mvp reit to vrm i and vrm ii through fees  million from vrm i and vrm ii to michael shustek through disposition fees and  million from vrm i and vrm ii to lance bradford through reduced sales prices given rising commercial real estate values in the las vegas office market it appears that either mvp reit acquired the shares at an inflated price or vrm i and vrm ii sold the shares at a submarket price – or both a possible fourth sale the sales of the six buildings to stable development in  included provisions allowing vrm i and ii to repurchase each building within one year at a  markupxxxi just before the repurchase options began expiring in january  vrm i vrm ii and stable development revised the repurchase agreementsxxxii the new purchase agreement allows vrm i and vrm ii to acquire  of stable development—whose only assets are the six buildings—from two entities for  million plus the outstanding debt on the six buildingsxxxiii if stable development did not pay down any of the mortgages the revised repurchase agreement allows vrm i and vrm ii to acquire the six buildings for  million a  markdown from the previous sale pricexxxiv shortly after vrm i and vrm ii sold the six buildings for a  million loss—but before the repurchase agreement was renegotiated vrm ii proposed a  reverse stock splitxxxv vrm ii required that partial shares ie investors with fewer than  presplit shares be bought out by the company it is curiously serendipitous that vrm ii took what turned out to be a temporary loss equal to  of its equity market capitalization at a time when mr shustek and other large shareholders of vrm ii would benefit from lower share pricesxxxvi in the six months before the reverse split was announced mr shustek increased his holdings from  to  of vrm ii the reverse split by eliminating smaller shareholders would further increase his holdings to xxxvii together the  million loss and the renegotiated repurchase agreement transferred more than  million in wealth from small vrm ii shareholders to mr shustek and other large vrm ii shareholders conclusion vrm i vrm ii mvp reit i and mvp reit ii illustrate the perils of nontraded reits in which control persons can direct transactions for their benefit with little or no regard for the harm they cause retail investors the extreme disregard shown by control persons for investors in these registered investments also highlights the potential risks associated
