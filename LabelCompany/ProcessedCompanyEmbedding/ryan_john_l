by a substantially concave driving flange description technical fieldthis invention relates to a mechanically power driven tubular steel fastener with a shaft which is basically triangular in crosssection and designed as a wood critical structural wood fastener to transfer high lateral shear stress loads with respect to both the longitudinal and transverse axes of the fastener more particularly the fastener used in conjunction with a specifically designed driving tool transfers the impact stresses during the driving process and transfers these stresses to the shaft sides to preclude mushrooming deformation of the head and shaft the lead end flanges are specifically formed for driving the fastener into a lesser diameter prebored lead hole and for post driven outward deflection and partial embdement into the walls of the lead hole or alternatively for optional deflection beyond the plane of the shaft sides to form a double headed fastener background art high volume construction techniques requiring prefabrication of wood building frames or framing components such as trusses joists beams plywood diagrams and the like has necessitated the search for improved fastening means except for glue lamination of structural beams and girders the joining of lumber and wood products has been largely limited to nails and staples inserted by hand or mechanical impact means using large quantities of low capacity fasteners to transfer large stress loads has proven to be generally impracticable both in terms of time and failure to attain the desired result screws afford small advantage over nails or staples having a small effective diameter shank and are thus normally used as anchors against withdrawal spikes lagscrews and bolts are normally employed to connect timber beams girders and trusses etc these devices afford higher allowable design loads in lateral shear but due to their size weight and use limitations are often of little benefit for commercial joining of lumber or wood product assemblies recent fastener inventions have included surface applied plate or framing anchor connectors that are generally used in lower structural design

the invention the present invention in contrast to the prior art known to the present inventor pertains to a fastener for joining lumber wood products or other materials having densities and characteristics similar to wood products into assemblies subject to high lateral shear stresses acting across the shaft perpendicular to the longitudinal axis the fastener further provides means to resist the forces causing rotation withdrawal or pullthrough all of which tend to part the members joined the fastener comprising a hollow triangular shaft with lead extension flanges and driving head flanges at the opposite ends of the shaft is power driven under compressive resistance into a prebored lead hole in the host members the lead hole is of a lesser diameter than the effective diameter of the fastener and the placement is by means of conventional power hammers riveters or presses utilizing an especially designed power drive adapter tool to mate with and drive the fastener as explained in greater detail hereinafter when power driven into the host members with the driving head flanges properly seated a rod of a length greater than the fastener and of a diameter of the approximate inside diameter of the fasteners hollow shaft is inserted down the shaft core to impact the interior faces of the lead extension flanges and deflect them outwardly into coplanar alignment with shaft sides the lead extension flanges are thus compressively interfaced with the surrouding host and embedding the offset lead extension flange stiffeners into the wall of the prebore collectively extends the effective length of the shaft sides to transfer higher lateral shear loads and secondly provides added resistance to rotation pullthrough and withdrawal during manufacture the fastener is progressively formed from a flat sheet metal blank with a width and length selected to develop the desired fastener shaft diameter and length three flange extensions are included at each end of the blanks length for progressive die formation of driving head flanges and lead extension flanges with the intervening body of the blank serving as the three shaft sides three continuous shaft stiffener ribs are integrally stamped longitudinally on center of the shaft sides to produce outward projecting ribs on the finished piece the three driving head flanges are formed thru approximately ninetyfive degrees with offset flange stiffeners formed at the extreme flange corners which result in a slightly downturned convex driving head symmetrically arranged around the longitudinal axis of the fastener to mate with the round concave face of the power driver adaptor tool flange the three lead extension flanges are formed flat as an extension of the shaft side at the shaft end and thence transitioning to a u form having their extreme corners offset for flange stiffening as for the stiffened head flanges opposite and thence finally formed having their extreme ends deflected inward in juxtaposition symmetrically about the longitudinal shaft axis as required to permit their tips to be freely inserted into the prebored lead hole for initial compressive resistance driving of the fastener the longitudinal shaft portion of the blank is then formed into a basic equilateral triangle with the shaft corners and the three projecting longitudinal stiffening ribs at the centers of the shaft sides of a similar radius to effect a symmetrical six cornered or ribbed star form for the shaft crosssection with the above noted prior art in mind one of the objects of the present invention is to develop a mechanically installed power driven lightweight high strength lateral shear fastener to join lumber plywood or wood product members or materials offering advantageous design alternatives to the use of common nails screws staples etc another object of the present invention is to develop a lateral shear fastener with exceptional shaft stiffness that could be classified as wood critical ie capable of failing ie destroying the host materials prior to fastener failure or yielding of the fastener on either longitudinal or transverse axes still another object of the present invention is to develop a lateral shear fastener of sheet metal which could sustain power driven impact forces sufficient to drive the fastener into a lesser diameter prebore lead hole under substantial compressive resistance and in turn preload or prestress the interfacing bond between the fastener and host to significantly reduce the initial slip factor when the assembly is subjected to lateral shear loads a further object of the present invention is to develop a lateral shear fastener with a shaft configuration possessing exceptional surface area contact with the host materials for a given diameter of fastener for maximum uniformity of omnidirectional stress transfer across the shaft yet another object of the present invention is to develop a lateral shear fastener from sheet metal that could classify as a structural fastener for adoption by building codes ie meeting short and long term loading corrosion allowances high unit stress design loads etc another object of the present invention is to develop a fastener that can be driven into a smaller diameter prebore lead hole under compressive resistance without undue distress to the host materials still a further object of the present invention is to develop a lateral shear fastener that provides positive mechanical resistance to rotation pullthrough and withdrawal another object of the present invention is to provide an especially designed power adaptor tool as required for power driving the fastener under compressive resistance while vectoring the impact forces inwardly toward and into the shaft sides secondly be adaptable to conventional power tools and thirdly deflect the lead extension flanges outward to engage the wall of the prebore and extend the effective length of the shaft sides still another object of the present invention is to develop a fastener with lead extension flanges of sufficient size strength and configuration which when fully driven may optionally be deflected further beyond the plane of the shaft sides to any selected countersunk angle or to approximately normal to the shaft sides similar to the driving head flanges to effect a double headed fastener brief

flange stiffeners  the material for shaft sides  with integrally formed shaft stifferer ribs  and lead extension flanges  having lead flange stifferners  referring now to fig  as seen along lines  of fig  the relative outward and slightly downwardly convex position of driving head flange  with offset flange stiffeners  and the lead extension flanges  with offset flange stiffeners  in relationship with the main basic shaft  and longitudinal stiffening ribs  may most readily be seen as explained hereinabove the partially formed piece as seen in figs  and  is then progressively formed along fold lines between and parallel to stiffener ribs  and forming a fastener with a basic shaft  in the form of an equilateral triangle as depicted in elevation fig  as is most clear in fig  which is a top plan view of the driving head flanges  and offset head flange stiffeners  extending radially outward to provide a rigid surface area for power impact driving and additionally serve as a stop drive point when the fastener is fully driven into the prebore  see fig  the basic shaft sides  having free edges of the blank are shown as abutting at one corner of the basic shaft and having abuttment line  referring now the fig  which is a sectional view along lines  of fig  the basic shaft configuration may readily be seen but as further shown the power driver adaptor shaft  which is sized for free insertion into the fasteners hollow core to serve for stability and prebore alignment during driving and subsequently using an extended or elongated adaptor shaft  to impact and deflect the led extension flanges outwardly fig  taken along lines  fig  is used to show more clearly the relationship of the lead extension flanges  with respect to the shaft sides  and as depicted the lead extension flanges and flange stiffeners  are formed to lie within the triangular shaft body  and the extreme portions of the flanges and stiffeners are freely inserted into the prebore lead hole not shown to augment initial resistance driving guidance referring to fig  an isometric view of the finished fastener the relative positions and interrelationship of the various elements may be reaidly seen referring to fig  which is a composite vertical crosssection adapted through the shaft for clarity through the fully driven fastener joining lumber and plywood with the driving head flanges  and head flange stiffeners  driven flush with the plywood surface and lead extension flanges  deflected outwardly into plane of the shaft sides  and lead extension flange stiffeners  embedded into the walls of the prebore lead hole  to effect positive mechanical resistance to rotation withdrawal or pullthrough fores acting against the fastener this configuration effectively extends or elongates the shaft length in compressive contact with the host to resist longitudinal rotation or overturning under critical lateral shear loads the prebored lead hole  is of lesser diameter than that which would circumscribe the basic shaft corners of the fastener requiring power driving of the fastener under substantial compressional resistance and displacement of wood fibers at the wall of the prebore the plasticity of wood or similar density materials altering the prebore hole to assume the configuration of the exterior shaft profile shown in fig  noted above the power driver adaptor shaft  mentioned above is shown as partially withdrawn from the shaft core after impacting and deflecting the lead extension flanges  outwardly in coplanar relation with the shaft sides  the power driver adaptor tool comprises a power driver adaptor shank  of various designs to mate with conventional power tools a power driver adaptor flange  with a concave face to interface with the generally convex form of the driver head flanges  and stiffeners  to vector driving impact forces inward and into the shaft sides  to obviate mushrooming deformation of the fasteners head flanges  and shaft  the driving adaptor shaft  is adjustable or elongated as required for stabilization and prebore alignment during power driving and subsequent impacting the inner faces of the lead extension flanges  to deflect them outwardly into the plane of the shaft sides  figs  and  are views from the leading end of the fastener and as seen in fig  the fastener is as manufactured and would be driven within a prebored hole of a radius approximately equal to the radius of the extreme outer surface of the shaft stiffener ribs  and shows the lead extension flanges  and lead flange stiffeners  in postdriven positions whereas fig  depicts the flanges  and stiffeners  after having been impacted and deflected radially outward by an extended driving adapter shaft  to effect coplanar alignment with the shaft sides  and to extend the effective shaft length compressive interfacing with the wall of the prebore lead hoel  fig  similar to fig  depicts a fully installed fastener in the double headed mode with the lead extension flanges  and stiffeners  deflected optionally through a range of approximately ninety degrees beyond the plane of the shaft sides and wall of the prebore lead hole transforming the lead extension flanges to another head similar and opposite to the driving head flanges the option for deflecting the lead extension flanges to various intermediate angles of countersinking not shown is open to selection thus as can be seen the present invention provides at a minimal cost for material and relative ease of fabrication a fastener which is adapted to be force driven using a particularly designed driving tool into a plastic host material resulting in a fastener with unprecedented shear resistance and security the particular configuration of the shaft sidewalls including the reinforcing and surface contacting ribs in conjunction with the lead and head end flanges and their integral strengthening elements result in this superior fastener  previous patent handheld tag

and answer any questions that you may have they must take the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or

expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback
