financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report overview dct industrial trust inc is a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the acquisition development leasing and management of bulk distribution and light industrial properties located in highvolume distribution markets in the united states as used herein the terms company we our and us refer to dct industrial trust inc and its subsidiaries including its operating partnership dct industrial operating partnership lp when we use the term dct we are referring to dct industrial trust inc by itself and not including any of its subsidiaries and when we use the term the operating partnership we are referring to dct industrial operating partnership lp by itself and not including any of its subsidiaries dct was formed as a maryland corporation in april  and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for us federal income tax purposes we are structured as an umbrella partnership reit under which substantially all of our current and future business is and will be conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary dct industrial operating partnership lp a delaware limited partnership for which dct is the sole general partner dct owns properties through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries as of december   dct owned approximately  of the outstanding equity interests in the operating partnership our primary business objectives are to maximize longterm growth in funds from operations or ffo as defined on page  net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns in our pursuit of these longterm objectives we seek to  maximize cash flows from existing properties  deploy capital into quality acquisitions and development opportunities which meet our asset location and financial criteria and  recycle capital by selling assets that no longer fit our investment criteria and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth opportunities outlook we seek to maximize longterm earnings growth and value within the context of overall economic conditions primarily through increasing occupancy rents and operating income at existing properties and acquiring and developing highquality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects fundamentals for industrial real estate continue to improve in response to general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets including the growth of ecommerce and us based manufacturing we expect moderate economic growth to continue through  which should result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms in response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels rental rates are increasing in most of our markets although they generally remain below peak levels rental concessions such as free rent have also declined in all markets consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during  to be higher than the rates on expiring leases as positive net absorption of warehouse space continues we expect the rental rate environment to continue to improve new development has begun to increase in many markets where fundamentals have improved however construction is below current levels of net absorption in most markets and below peak levels we expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for landlords with a meaningful improvement of rental rates and continued strong occupancy levels we expect same store net operating income to be higher in  than it was in  primarily as a result of higher occupancy in  and the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in  compared to expiring leases in terms of capital investment we will continue to pursue the acquisition of welllocated distribution facilities at prices where we can apply our leasing experience and market knowledge to generate attractive returns going forward we will pursue the acquisition of buildings and land and consider selective development of new buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns we anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of nonstrategic assets where demand continues at levels where we perceive opportunities to recycles capital into higher growth assets in an effort to enhance longterm growth in earnings and cash flows we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses including costs to maintain our properties and distributions though we may finance investments including acquisitions and developments with the issuance of new common shares proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings please see liquidity and capital resources for additional discussion inflation although the us economy has recently experienced a modest increase in inflation rates and a wide variety of industries and sectors are affected differently by changing commodity prices inflation has not had a significant impact on us in our markets most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of operating expenses including common area maintenance real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at thenexisting market rates summary of significant transactions during  significant transactions for the year ended december

common stockunit and per shareunit data for all periods presented in this annual report on form k have been restated to give effect to the reverse stock split critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following discussion pertains to accounting policies management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require managements most difficult subjective or complex estimates revenue recognition we record rental revenues on a straightline basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term certain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease accordingly we record receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term rather than currently which are recorded as a straightline rent receivable when we acquire a property the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation tenant recovery income includes payments and amounts due from tenants pursuant to their leases for real estate taxes insurance and other recoverable property operating expenses and is recognized as rental revenues during the same period the related expenses are incurred we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances in connection with property acquisitions qualifying as business combinations we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to rental revenues over the reasonably assured term of the related leases the unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our consolidated statements of operations on a straightline basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term early lease termination fees are recorded in rental revenues on a straightline basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term or upon collection if collectability is not assured we earn revenues from asset management fees acquisition fees property management fees and fees for other services pursuant to joint venture and other agreements we recognize revenues from asset management fees acquisition fees property management fees and fees for other services when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable we develop certain properties for specific buyers called buildtosuit projects we make certain judgments based on the specific terms of each project as to the amount and timing of recognition of profits from the project projects are generally accounted for using the percentage of completion method or full accrual method profits under the percentage of completion method are based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy the percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs changes in job performance job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to the costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined if the sale recognition criteria for using the percentage of completion or full accrual methods are not met we apply another recognition method provided by gaap such as the installment or cost recovery methods the profit recognized from these projects is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable and is included in development profit net of taxes capitalization of costs we capitalize costs directly related to the development predevelopment redevelopment or improvement of our investment in real estate referred to as capital projects and other activities included within this paragraph costs associated with our capital projects are capitalized as incurred if the project is abandoned these costs are expensed during the period in which the project is abandoned costs considered for capitalization include but are not limited to construction costs interest real estate taxes and insurance if appropriate we capitalize indirect costs such as personnel office and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects based on an estimate of the time spent on the construction and development activities these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use we determine when the capitalization period begins and ends through communication with project and other managers responsible for the tracking and oversight of individual projects in the event that the activities to ready the asset for its intended use are suspended the capitalization period will cease until such activities are resumed in addition we capitalize initial direct costs incurred for successful origination of new leases costs incurred for maintaining and repairing our properties which do not extend their useful lives are expensed as incurred interest is capitalized based on actual capital expenditures from the period when development or redevelopment commences until the asset is ready for its intended use at the weighted average borrowing rates in effect during the period we also capitalize interest on our qualifying investments in unconsolidated joint ventures based on the average capital invested in a venture during the period when the venture has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations at our weighted average borrowing rate during the period a qualifying investment is an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture provided that our investees activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets such as development or predevelopment activities and planned principal operations have not commenced investment in properties we record the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests associated with property acquisitions which qualify as business combinations at their respective acquisition date fair values which are derived using a market income or replacement cost approach or a combination thereof acquisition related costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred as defined by gaap a business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners members or participants we generally do not consider acquisitions of land or unoccupied buildings to be business combinations rather these transactions are treated as asset acquisitions and recorded at cost the fair value of identifiable tangible assets such as land building building and land improvements and tenant improvements is determined on an asifvacant basis which requires significant judgment by management management considers estimates such as the replacement cost of such assets appraisals property condition reports comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets the recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes the value associated with leasing commissions legal and other costs as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement an intangible asset or liability resulting from inplace leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon managements estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the reasonably assured lease term of the remaining inplace leases as an adjustment to rental revenues or real estate related depreciation and amortization depending on the nature of the intangible the difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt assumed the valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date we have certain properties which we have acquired or removed from service with the intention to redevelop the property buildings under redevelopment require significant construction activities prior to being placed back into service we generally do not depreciate properties classified as redevelopment until the date that the redevelopment properties are ready for their intended use real estate including land building building and land improvements and tenant improvements leasing costs and intangible lease assets and liabilities are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization unless circumstances indicate that the cost cannot be recovered in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value our estimate of the useful life of our assets is evaluated upon acquisition and when circumstances indicate a change in the useful life which requires significant judgment regarding the economic obsolescence of tangible and intangible assets impairment of properties investments in properties classified as held for use are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable as we selectively dispose of nonstrategic assets and redeploy the proceeds into higher growth assets our intended hold period may change due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset as a result we would assess whether that asset is impaired depending on the carrying value of the property at that time and the amount that we estimate we would receive on disposal we may record an impairment loss other indicators include the point at which we deem a building to be held for sale or when a building remains vacant significantly longer than expected    feb   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights

industrial operating partnership lp a delaware limited partnership except as otherwise indicated herein the terms “company” “we” “our” and “us” refer to dct industrial trust inc and its subsidiaries including its operating partnership dct industrial operating partnership lp when we use the term “dct” or “dct industrial” we are referring to dct industrial trust inc by itself and not including any of its subsidiaries and when we use the term “operating partnership” we are referring to dct industrial operating partnership lp by itself and not including any of its subsidiaries we are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership acquisition development leasing and management of bulkdistribution and lightindustrial properties located in highdemand distribution markets in the united states dcts actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and wellpositioned to take advantage of market dynamics dct has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for us federal income tax purposes we are structured as an umbrella partnership reit under which substantially all of our current and future business is and will be conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary dct industrial operating partnership lp a delaware limited partnership for which dct is the sole general partner we own our properties through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries as of march    dct owned approximately  of the outstanding equity interests in the operating partnership we operate dct and the operating partnership as one enterprise the management of dct consists of the same members as the management of the operating partnership as general partner with control of the operating partnership dct consolidates the operating partnership for financial reporting purposes dct does not have significant assets other than its investment in the operating partnership therefore the assets and liabilities of dct and the operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements we believe combining the quarterly reports on form q of dct and the operating partnership into this single report results in the following benefits • enhances investors’ understanding of dct and the operating partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business • eliminates duplicative disclosures and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation as a substantial portion of the company’s disclosures apply to both dct and the operating partnership and • creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports stockholders’ equity partners’ capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of dct and those of the operating partnership equity interests in the operating partnership held by entities other than dct are classified within partners’ capital in the operating partnership’s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in dct’s financial statements equity interests of  of the operating partnership were owned by executives and nonaffiliated limited partners as of march    to help investors understand the differences between dct and the operating partnership this report provides separate consolidated financial statements for dct and the operating partnership a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity’s stockholders’ equity or partners’ capital as applicable and a combined management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section that includes distinct information related to each entity this report also includes separate part i item  controls and procedures sections and separate exhibits  and  certifications for dct and the operating

inc and its subsidiaries including its operating partnership dct industrial operating partnership lp when we use the term “dct” or “dct industrial” we are referring to dct industrial trust inc by itself and not including any of its subsidiaries and when we use the term “operating partnership” we are referring to dct industrial operating partnership lp by itself and not including any of its subsidiaries dct was formed as a maryland corporation in april  and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for us federal income tax purposes we are structured as an umbrella partnership reit under which substantially all of our current and future business is and will be conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary dct industrial operating partnership lp a delaware limited partnership for which dct is the sole general partner dct owns properties through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries as of march    dct owned approximately  of the outstanding equity interests in the operating partnership as of march    the company owned interests in approximately  million square feet of properties leased to approximately  customers including •  million square feet comprising  consolidated operating properties that were  occupied •  million square feet comprising  unconsolidated properties that were  occupied and which we operated on behalf of two institutional capital management partners and an unconsolidated joint venture  •  million square feet comprising three consolidated valueadd acquisitions •  million square feet comprising three consolidated properties under redevelopment and •  million square feet comprising four consolidated properties developed by dct which are shellcomplete and in leaseup in addition the company has  projects under construction and several projects in predevelopment see “note  – investment in properties” for further details note  – summary of significant accounting policies interim financial information   the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx for interim financial information accordingly these statements do not include all of the information and notes required by gaap for complete financial statements in the opinion of management the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments consisting of normal recurring items necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with gaap interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year the information included in this form q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and related notes thereto included in our form k filed on february   basis of presentation and principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial position results of operations and cash flows of the company the operating partnership their whollyowned qualified reit subsidiaries and taxable reit subsidiaries and their consolidated joint ventures in which they have a controlling interest  equity interests in the operating partnership held by entities other than dct are classified within partners’ capital in the operating partnership’s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in dct’s financial statements equity interests in entities consolidated into the operating partnership that are held by third parties are reflected in our accompanying balance sheets as noncontrolling interests we also have noncontrolling partnership interests in unconsolidated institutional capital management and other joint ventures which are accounted for under the equity method all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation we hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures for the purposes of operating and developing industrial real estate all joint ventures over which we have financial and operating control and variable interest entities “vies” in which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary are included in the consolidated financial statements we use the equity method of accounting for joint ventures over which we do not have a controlling interest or where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions but where we exercise significant influence and include our share of earnings or losses of these joint ventures in our consolidated results of operations we analyze our joint ventures in accordance with gaap to determine whether they are vies and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie involves consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest our representation on the entity’s board of directors or equivalent body the size of our investment including loans our obligation or right to absorb its losses or receive its benefits and our ability to participate in major decisions   if a joint venture does not meet the characteristics of a vie we apply the voting interest model to determine whether the entity should be consolidated our ability to assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financial statements and our financial position and results of operations we concluded our operating partnership meets the criteria of a vie as the operating partnership’s limited partners do not have the right to remove the general partner and do not have substantive participating rights in the operations of the operating partnership under the amended and restated limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership the “partnership agreement” dct is the primary beneficiary of the operating partnership as we have the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits and the power to control substantially all of the activities which most significantly impact the economic performance of the operating partnership accordingly the operating partnership is consolidated within dct’s financial statements use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates cash cash equivalents and restricted cash cash and cash equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and other highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of three months or less we have not realized any losses in our cash and cash equivalents and believe that these shortterm instruments are not exposed to any significant credit risk restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes insurance and capital replacement reserves security deposits and amounts held by intermediary agents to be used for taxdeferred likekind exchange transactions as of march   approximately  million of restricted cash was included in “cash cash equivalents and restricted cash” in our consolidated statements of cash flows related to tax deferred likekind exchange transactions that was utilized during   the following table presents a reconciliation of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within our consolidated balance sheets to amounts reported within our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands     as of march          cash and cash equivalents         restricted cash       restricted cash included in other assets net       total cash cash equivalents and restricted cash          revenue recognition at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to  or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to  or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained investment tax credits of the leased building generally our leases do not meet any of the other criteria above and accordingly are classified as operating leases we record rental revenues on a straightline basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term certain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease accordingly receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term are recorded on the balance sheet as straightline rent receivables the total increase to “rental revenues” due to straightline rent adjustments was approximately  million and  million for the three months ended march   and   respectively if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when we are the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into rental revenues over the lease term when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements we record any tenant improvement allowance funded as a lease incentive and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the lease term tenant recovery income includes reimbursements due from tenants pursuant to their leases for real estate taxes insurance repairs and maintenance and other recoverable property operating expenses and is recognized as “rental revenues” during the period the related expenses are incurred the reimbursements are recognized and presented on a gross basis as the company is generally the primary obligor and with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk tenant recovery income recognized as “rental revenues” was approximately  million and  million for the three months ended march   and   respectively we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments if a customer fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances in connection with property acquisitions qualifying as business combinations we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to “rental revenues” over the reasonably assured term of the related leases we consider a reasonably assured term to be the measurement period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease for abovemarket leases and the initial term plus the term of any belowmarket fixed rate renewal options for belowmarket leases the unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our consolidated statements of operations on a straightline basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term the total net impact to “rental revenues” due to the amortization of above and below market rents was an increase of approximately  million

customers “asu ” that requires companies to recognize revenue from contracts with customers based upon the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also results in enhanced disclosures about revenue provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improves guidance for multipleelement arrangements the fasb subsequently issued additional asus which improve guidance and provide clarification of the new standard the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after december   the company expects to adopt the standard effective january   and utilize the modified retrospective transition method given the nature of our business our primary revenue stream is from relatively short lived leases with tenants we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in february  the fasb issued an asu that modifies existing accounting standards for lease accounting the new standard requires a lessee to record a lease asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months leases will be classified as either finance or operating this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease leases in which we are the lessee will generally be accounted for as operating leases and we will record a lease asset and a lease liability leases in which we are the lessors will be accounted as salestype leases direct financing leases or operating leases revenue related to the lease components of a lease contract will be recognized on a straightline basis while revenue related to nonlease components will be recognized under asu  the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after december   leases in which we are the lessor will continue to be accounted for as operating leases with minimal impact on the companys financial condition or results of operation the standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with an option to use certain transition relief the company expects to adopt this standard effective january   the new standard allows only for the capitalization of initial direct costs that would have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained the adoption of this guidance will impact our current policy regarding the capitalization of internal direct costs related to the successful origination of new leases in march  the fasb issued an asu that simplifies the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including income tax consequences the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification on the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted effective january   we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures the adoption of the guidance was applied prospectively and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or consolidated statements of cash flows in january  the fasb issued an asu that clarifies the definition of a business the asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted we adopted this standard prospectively effective january   as a result we anticipate that fewer of our acquisitions made in the normal course of business will meet the definition of a business as our typical acquisitions consist of properties whereby substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset land building and

march   and december    the fair values of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values due to the shortterm nature of settlement of these instruments the fair values of other financial instruments subject to fair value disclosures were determined based on available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate estimates for these purposes considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates our estimates may differ from the actual amounts that we could realize upon disposition the following table summarizes these financial instruments in thousands     as of march     as of december       carrying amounts   estimated fair value

              interest rate contracts                 interest rate swap asset                       the fair values of our borrowings were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology credit spreads and market interest rates used to determine the fair value of these instruments are based on unobservable level  inputs which management has determined to be its best estimate of current market values    the carrying amount of our fixed rate debt includes premiums and discounts and excludes deferred loan costs    the fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash flows and the discounted expected variable cash flows based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from level  observable market interest rate curves we also incorporate a credit valuation adjustment which is derived using unobservable level  inputs to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement the asset or liability is included in “other assets net” or “other liabilities” respectively in our consolidated balance sheets  the following table presents a reconciliation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level  the table also displays gains and losses

issuances of fixed rate debt we primarily use treasury locks and interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy these derivatives are designed to mitigate the risk of future interest rate increases by providing a fixed interest rate for a limited predetermined period of time such derivatives have been used to hedge the variability in existing and future interest expense associated with existing variable rate borrowings and forecasted issuances of debt which may include issuances of new debt as well as refinancing of existing debt upon maturity accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the designation of the derivative whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interest rate risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge for derivatives designated as “cash flow” hedges the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in “other comprehensive income “oci”” in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income ie not included in earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings or the hedging relationship is no longer effective at which time the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value is recognized directly into earnings we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship whenever financial statements are issued or earnings are reported and at least every three months we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes during june   certain of our consolidated ventures entered into two payfixed receivefloating interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the  month usd libor rates the payfixed receivefloating interest rate swaps have an effective date of june  and a maturity date of june   these interest rates swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the related debt instruments at   as of march   and december    we had borrowings payable subject to these payfixed receivefloating interest swaps with aggregate principal balances of approximately  million in each corresponding period  during december   we entered into a payfixed receivefloating interest rate swap to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the  month usd libor rates on our  million unsecured term loan the payfixed receivefloating interest rate swap has an effective date of december  and a maturity date of december   the interest rate swap effectively fixes the interest rate on the related debt instrument at   however there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt is subject to a  floor in the event that usd libor is negative the company will make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the negative spread between usd libor and zero during the three months ended march   and   we recorded a noncash charge of approximately  and  million  respectively of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to a  floor mismatch in the hedging relationships ie there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt from which the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to flow is subject to a  floor on the usd libor component of the interest rate as of march   and december    the entire  million principal amount of the term loan was subject to this payfixed receivefloating interest swap the following table presents the effect of our derivative financial instruments on our accompanying consolidated financial statements in thousands     for the three months ended march

interest expense ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing                 amounts reported in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” related to derivatives will be amortized to “interest expense” as interest payments are made on our current debt and anticipated debt issuances during the next  months we estimate that approximately  million will be reclassified from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” to “interest expense” resulting in an increase in interest expense note  – outstanding indebtedness as of march    our outstanding indebtedness of approximately

and excluding accrued interest of approximately  million  the notes were issued under our indenture dated october   and form part of the same series as our previously issued  senior notes due   we primarily used the net proceeds to pay down our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes guarantee of debt dct has guaranteed the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior unsecured notes and the bank unsecured credit facilities note  – noncontrolling interests dct noncontrolling interests are the portion of equity or net assets in

converted to general partner units to satisfy this requirement as illustrated in the consolidated statement of changes in capital limited partners have the right to require the company to redeem all or a portion of the op units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the cash amount as defined in the partnership agreement provided that such op units have been outstanding for at least one year the company may in its sole discretion purchase the op units by paying to the limited partner either the cash amount or the reit shares amount generally one share of

per common shareunit which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net earnings per shareunit for common stockunit and any participating securities according to dividends declared whether paid or unpaid and participation rights in undistributed earnings under the twoclass method net earnings per common shareunit are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholdersop unitholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholdersop unitholders by the weighted average number of common sharesunits outstanding for the period a participating security is defined by gaap as an unvested sharebased payment award containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends and must be included in the computation of earnings per shareunit pursuant to the twoclass method nonvested restricted stock and ltip units are considered participating securities as these sharebased awards contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends irrespective of whether the

internal reporting of operating results used to assess performance based on our properties’ geographical markets our markets are aggregated into three reportable regions or segments east central and west which are based on the geographical locations of our properties management considers rental revenues and property net operating income aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze

amortization casualty and involuntary conversion gain loss impairment general and administrative expenses equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense interest and other income and income tax expense and other taxes we consider property noi to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because property noi reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties such as amortization depreciation impairment interest expense interest and other income income tax expense and other taxes and general and administrative expenses  however property noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our overall financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations further our property noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating property noi  therefore we believe net income as defined by gaap to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance   note  – subsequent events gaap requires an entity to disclose events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued “subsequent events” as well as the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events there are two types of subsequent events the first type consists of events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements “recognized subsequent events” the second type consists of events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date “nonrecognized subsequent events” no significant recognized or nonrecognized subsequent events were noted  item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forwardlooking statements we make statements in this report that

general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets including the growth of ecommerce and us based manufacturing we expect moderate economic growth to continue in  which we expect to result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms  in response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels rental rates are increasing in most of our markets rental concessions such as free rent remain at historically low levels consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during  to be higher than the rates on expiring leases new development including speculative development is present in most markets in response to strong tenant demand for highquality space however construction remains rational in relation to net absorption in most markets and below historical peak levels we expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for lessors given our favorable outlook for market occupancy levels and rental rate growth we expect samestore net operating income to be higher in  than it was in  primarily as a result of the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in  and  compared to expiring leases in terms of capital investment we will continue to pursue selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns we anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of nonstrategic assets to fund our investment in developments and acquisitions in an effort to enhance longterm growth in our net asset value earnings and cash flows as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses including costs to maintain our properties and distributions though we may finance investments including acquisitions and developments with the issuance of new common shares proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings please see “liquidity and capital resources” for additional discussion inflation the us economy has experienced low inflation over the past several years and as a result inflation has not had a significant impact on our business moreover most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of the cost to operate our properties including common area maintenance real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation in addition most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at thenexisting market rates while slowing global growth has the potential to dampen demand for distribution space we have not yet seen any indications of this reduced demand summary of significant transactions and activities for the three months ended march   • development activities • as of march    we completed shell construction on

depreciation amortization casualty and involuntary conversion gain loss impairment general and administrative expenses equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense interest and other income and income tax expense and other taxes we consider property noi to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because property noi reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties such as amortization depreciation impairment interest expense interest and other income income tax expense and other taxes and general and administrative expenses  however property noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our overall financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations  further our property noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating property noi  therefore we believe net income as defined by gaap to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance for a

million to  million during the three months ended march   compared to  million during the same period in   this change was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income attributable to acquired properties development and redevelopment properties and valueadd acquisitions placed into operation and operating performance at existing properties net cash used in investing activities increased  million to  million during the three months ended march   compared to  million during the same period in  primarily due to the following activities •  million increase in cash outflows

income loss attributable to common stockholders as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however dct industrial considers ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” to be a useful supplemental nongaap measure of dct industrial’s operating performance  nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance of an equity reit in order to recognize that the value of incomeproducing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap  ffo is generally defined as net income attributable to common stockholders calculated in accordance with gaap with the following adjustments • add real estaterelated depreciation and amortization • subtract gains from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes • add impairment losses on depreciable real estate and impairments of in substance real estate investments in investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and • adjustments for the preceding items to derive dct industrial’s proportionate share of ffo of unconsolidated joint ventures  we also present ffo as adjusted which excludes hedge ineffectiveness certain severance costs acquisition costs debt modification costs and impairment losses on properties which are not depreciable we believe that ffo as adjusted excluding hedge ineffectiveness certain severance costs acquisition costs debt modification costs and impairment losses on nondepreciable real estate is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of our operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results  readers should note that ffo or ffo as adjusted captures neither the changes in the value of dct industrial’s properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of dct industrial’s properties all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact dct industrial’s results from operations nareit’s definition of ffo is subject to interpretation and modifications to the nareit definition of ffo are common accordingly dct industrial’s ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to other reits’ ffo or ffo as adjusted should be considered only as a supplement to net income loss as a measure of dct industrial’s performance the following table presents the calculation of our ffo reconciled from “net income attributable to common stockholders” unaudited amounts in thousands except per share and unit data     for the three months ended march

exposure to losses resulting from changes in market prices such as interest rates and rental rates our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates accordingly we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service acquisitions capital expenditures distributions to stockholders and op unitholders and other cash requirements the majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates interest rate risk our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other variable rate borrowings and forecasted fixed rate debt issuances including refinancing of existing fixed rate debt interest rate risk may result from many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control to manage interest rate risk for variable rate debt and issuances of fixed rate debt in the past we have primarily used treasury locks and forwardstarting swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy these derivatives are designed to mitigate the risk of future interest rate increases by providing a fixed interest rate for a limited predetermined period of time we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors during june   certain of our consolidated ventures entered into two payfixed receivefloating interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the  month usd libor rates the payfixed receivefloating interest rate swaps have an effective date of june  and a maturity date of june   these interest rates swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the related debt instruments at   as of march   and december    we had borrowings payable subject to these payfixed receivefloating interest swaps with aggregate principal balances of approximately  million in each corresponding period     during december   we entered into a payfixed receivefloating interest rate swap to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the  month usd libor rates on our  million unsecured term loan the payfixed receivefloating interest rate swap has an effective date of december  and a maturity date of december   the interest rate swap effectively fixes the interest rate on the related debt instrument at   however there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt is subject to a  floor while libor rates in certain foreign countries have been or are currently negative usd libor rates in the us have never been negative nor do we expect them to become negative in the future in the event that usd libor is negative the company will make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the negative spread between usd libor and zero during the three months ended march   and   we recorded a noncash charge of approximately  and  million  respectively of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to a  floor mismatch in the hedging relationships ie there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt from which the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to flow is subject to a  floor on the usd libor component of the interest rate as of march   and december    the entire  million principal amount of the term loan was subject to this payfixed receivefloating interest swap see “notes to a consolidated financial statements note  – financial instruments and hedging activities” for additional information our variable rate debt is subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates as of march    we had approximately  million of variable rate debt outstanding indexed to libor rates if the libor rates relevant to our variable rate debt were to increase  we estimate that our interest expense during the three months ended march   would have increased approximately  million based on our outstanding floatingrate debt as of march    additionally if weighted average interest rates on our fixed rate debt were to have increased by  basis points due to refinancing interest expense would have increased by approximately  million during the three months ended march    as of march    the estimated fair value of our debt was approximately  billion based on our estimate of the thencurrent market interest rates  item  controls and procedures dct industrial trust inc evaluation of disclosure controls
