against crh its subsidiaries and two competitors in which the plaintiffs accused crh and the others of operating a cartel and employing an illegal and anticompetitive eviction strategy in order to put them out of business in  crh applied successfully to have the claim dismissed on the basis of the inordinate and inexcusable delay in bringing forward any evidence in the case that judgement was appealed to the supreme court in  at the time of the appeal it emerged that the presiding judge in the proceedings had ownership of some shares in crh and was forced to stand down in  a separate irish

ozarow said the allegations were without foundation it was also revealed in  that crh contributed € to a charity founded by the wife of poland’s president jolanta kwasniewska both crh and the polish first lady denied any sinister motive behind the transaction irelandedit in  crh was accused of making corrupt payments to ireland’s former taoiseach prime minister charles j haughey as details emerged of how mr haughey received crooked payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours in  roadstone ltd crh sold  acres of land to mr haughey the then minister of finance for £ in  mr haughey sold  acres of that land back to crh for £ within four years mr haughey had made a net profit of £ and  acres at crh’s expense charles j haughey was also offered chairmanship of crh in  illegal ansbacher bankedit the existence of a clandestine bank illegally providing off shore accounts first emerged in  during the mccracken tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to corrupt former taoiseach irish prime minister charles haughey and former cabinet minister michael lowry it emerged this illegal bank was founded in the s and was being run by des traynor who was chairman of crh from  to  and who ran his bank during that period out of crh’s registered office in dublins fitzwilliam square where the company provided an office for its chairman mr traynor was also personal financier to charles haughey during the investigation it materialised that justice moriarty held approximately £ in crh shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning crh he was not he said precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from des traynors offices at fitzwilliam square sharp criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing moriarty given his shareholding in  as evidence on the scale of the ansbacher accounts grew taniste irish deputy prime minister and pd minister mary harney asked the high court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders the high court inspectors report was published in  it found that eight out of fifteen crh directors held ansbacher accounts including four former chairmen it also concluded chapter  p  that crh as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of ansbacher’s activities in ireland after the publication of the report crh acknowledged publicly that its then chairman had misused its facilities and personnel which represented a grave breach of trust by mr traynor sale of glen ding landsedit in  further questions were asked about crh’s influence and political corruption when dáil éireann ireland’s parliament voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £ million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to roadstone a subsidiary company of crh without public tender for £ million in  many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale charles j haughey was taoiseach and his financier des traynor was chairman of crh dáil éireann however voted not to investigate whether crh had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of glen ding subsequently corrupt findings in unrelated matters have been made against a number of those who voted against the investigation the states comptroller and auditor general conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell far short of the roadstone offer and that the department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the state section  it did also note even though it is unlikely that the roadstone offer would have been bettered the attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the state is doing business it was noted by the departments accounting officer that the roadstone offer was more than  above the only alternative offer received that another bidder was afforded every opportunity to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues in retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional the glen ding transaction was further investigated by the moriarty tribunal which in  reported its conclusion that there was no connection directly or indirectly between mr charles haughey and any aspect of this disposal nor any connection between the operation of the ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal public criticismedit in  opposition td teachta dála  irish member of parliament phil hogan who later became minister for environment    stated in dáil éireann that there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy………in the case of crh profits have been extracted from the irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anticompetitive and anticonsumer the european court of first instance and finally the european court of justice have upheld findings of serious anticompetitive behaviour against crh and other while sweden finland uk france and germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry ireland’s answer has been a stony silence in  td shane ross a repeated critic of crh as a journalist stated that crh disturbs him and questioned why there had been no investigation of crh in ireland considering the adverse findings made against the company elsewhere see alsoedit the major international materials groups that would be comparable to crh

emerged of how mr haughey received crooked payments from various companies and businessmen in return for political favours in  roadstone ltd crh sold  acres of land to mr haughey the then minister of finance for £ in  mr haughey sold  acres of that land back to crh for £ within four years mr haughey had made a net profit of £ and  acres at crh’s expense charles j haughey was also offered chairmanship of crh in  illegal ansbacher bankedit the existence of a clandestine bank illegally providing off shore accounts first emerged in  during the mccracken tribunal set up to investigate reports of secret payments to corrupt former taoiseach irish prime minister charles haughey and former cabinet minister michael lowry it emerged this illegal bank was founded in the s and was being run by des traynor who was chairman of crh from  to  and who ran his bank during that period out of crh’s registered office in dublins fitzwilliam square where the company provided an office for its chairman mr traynor was also personal financier to charles haughey during the investigation it materialised that justice moriarty held approximately £ in crh shares and while that in his opinion precluded him from investigating certain matters concerning crh he was not he said precluded from inquiring into banking activities conducted from des traynors offices at fitzwilliam square sharp criticism was laid upon those in charge of appointing moriarty given his shareholding in  as evidence on the scale of the ansbacher accounts grew taniste irish deputy prime minister and pd minister mary harney asked the high court to appoint inspectors who could identify the account holders the high court inspectors report was published in  it found that eight out of fifteen crh directors held ansbacher accounts including four former chairmen it also concluded chapter  p  that crh as a corporation cannot be said to have knowingly assisted in the carrying out of ansbacher’s activities in ireland after the publication of the report crh acknowledged publicly that its then chairman had misused its facilities and personnel which represented a grave breach of trust by mr traynor sale of glen ding landsedit in  further questions were asked about crh’s influence and political corruption when dáil éireann ireland’s parliament voted against an investigation into why an asset with the potential to produce a yield of £ million in terms of sand and gravel reserves was sold to roadstone a subsidiary company of crh without public tender for £ million in  many opposition members of parliament voiced concerns that at the time of sale charles j haughey was taoiseach and his financier des traynor was chairman of crh dáil éireann however voted not to investigate whether crh had donated funds to any political party or politician before or after the purchase of glen ding subsequently corrupt findings in unrelated matters have been made against a number of those who voted against the investigation the states comptroller and auditor general conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell far short of the roadstone offer and that the department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the state section  it did also note even though it is unlikely that the roadstone offer would have been bettered the attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the state is doing business it was noted by the departments accounting officer that the roadstone offer was more than  above the only alternative offer received that another bidder was afforded every opportunity to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues in retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional the glen ding transaction was further investigated by the moriarty tribunal which in  reported its conclusion that there was no connection directly or indirectly between mr charles haughey and any aspect of this disposal nor any connection between the operation of the ansbacher accounts and any aspect of the disposal public criticismedit in  opposition td teachta dála  irish member of parliament phil hogan who later became minister for environment    stated in dáil éireann that there is a widespread problem with competition in this economy………in the case of crh profits have been extracted from the irish economy by means of a complex industry structure that is both anticompetitive and anticonsumer the european court of first instance and finally the european court of justice have upheld findings of serious anticompetitive behaviour against crh and other while sweden finland uk france and germany have since levied huge fines against the cement industry ireland’s answer has been a stony silence in  td shane ross a repeated critic of crh as a journalist stated that crh disturbs him and questioned why there

against the investigation the states comptroller and auditor general conducted an investigation into the sale and found that the competing bid fell far short of the roadstone offer and that the department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the state section  it did also note even though it is unlikely that the roadstone offer would have been bettered the attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the state is doing business it was noted by the departments accounting officer that the roadstone offer was more than  above the only alternative offer received that another bidder was afforded every opportunity to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues in retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional the glen ding transaction was further investigated by the moriarty tribunal which in  reported its conclusion that there
