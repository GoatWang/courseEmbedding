second quarter according to an snl energy analysis of us mine safety and health administration data down from the previous quarter as railroad transportation issues stymied demand firstquarter production from the prb mines totaled  million tons the secondquarter production total represented a  increase over the  million tons produced in the second quarter of  ten of the  prb mines reported higher production in the second quarter than the yearago quarter production from the mines in the  months ended in the second quarter totaled  million tons down  from the  million tons produced in the yearago period a shift away from  btulb coal is taking place in the prb as coal producers focus their capital expenditures on developing their higherquality  btulb mines cloud peak energy incs cordero rojo mine which produces  btulb coal produced  million tons in the  months ended in the second quarter down  compared to the yearago period cloud peak is reducing production at cordero rojo by about  million tons per year starting in  according to snl energy overthecounter market survey data  prb  btulb coal was priced at ton as of aug  the   btulb coal product was priced at ton there is quite a spread at the moment cloud peak president and ceo colin marshall said during the companys secondquarter earnings call july  id look at it and say well im glad were not trying to sell those tons into next year because i think at the moment the prices arent that attractive so it reinforces why we made the decision to cut production at cordero rojo and we think that being able to deploy those assets to the dragline and some other assets around the business will give us the best return marshall said cloud peak is benefiting from the plans to cascade equipment from cordero rojo to the other mine sites the company spent just  million in capital expenditures in the second quarter almost entirely associated with ensuring the ongoing integrity of its existing equipment peabody energy corps caballo mine which produces  btulb coal also has seen production totals decline the mine which produced  million tons in  has only produced  million tons in the first half of  caballo production in

produced  million tons in the  months ended in the second quarter down  from the  million tons produced in the yearago period the mines boosting production in the second quarter include peabodys north antelope rochelle operation cloud peaks antelope mine and westmoreland coal cos absaloka mine north antelope the highestproducing mine in the us produced  million tons in the second quarter up  from the  million tons produced in the yearago quarter peabody also increased quarterly production year over year at its rawhide mine in wyoming during the quarter westmorelands absaloka mine buoyed by a new deal with transalta centralia generation and a newly constructed rail wye saw production soar in the second quarter compared to the yearago quarter despite continued rail transportation woes the transportation issue is likely to last into  possibly weighing on prb production totals for the remainder of the year some utilities are still not receivingtheir normal shipments and several coal executives including at arch coal inc and cloud peak said rail performance was far from optimal in june and july the rail performance represents the largest risk to our business marshall said the tons are sold the customers certainly have very low stockpiles and would like to take delivery and the mines are in good shape we would very much like to deliver that coal in the second half and certainly

the single largest source of coal mined in the united states and contains one of the largest deposits of coal in the world most of the active coal mining in the powder river basin actually takes place in drainages of the cheyenne river because of the powder river basin wyoming has been the top coalproducing state in the united states since  in  the powder river basin alone produced  million short tons  million tonnes of coal more than twice the production of secondplace west virginia and more than the entire appalachian region overall the powder river basin accounts for about  percent of us coal production the black thunder mine is the most productive coal mine in the united states in  this single mine produced  million metric tons of coal more than any state except wyoming west virginia and kentucky the majority of the coal mined in the prb is part of the fort union formation because of its low sulfur and fly ash content this coal is exported outside the region and supplies of the coal in the region makes it very desirable coal supplies about half of the united states electricity supplies with the prb mines supplying around  of the coal that fuels those stations mainly to the

estimate arrived at by a  study of the same field which arrived at an economically recoverable resource of  billion short tons however if the price of coal is assumed to be  per ton matching the sales price of coal for the gillette coalfield as of march  the reserve would be  billion short tons assuming no increase from  operating costs if cost per ton rose to  the estimated reserve would rise to
