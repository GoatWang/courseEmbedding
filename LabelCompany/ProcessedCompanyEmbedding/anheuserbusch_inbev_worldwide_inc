contraction in consumption and the industry in argentina due to structural reforms higher tariffs and high inflation solid revenue management and cost controls helped offset volume declines in the

now represents nearly half of our domestic beer sales we launched the noalcohol corona cero in mexico with a “same taste no alcohol” campaign and expect it to help create new consumption occasions and increase consumption frequency in the country strengthened by consistent positioning efforts premium brands club colombia in colombia and cusqueña in peru delivered doubledigit topline growth we also

energy drink maker hiball chris furnari jul   at  pm one year after inking a deal with coffee giant starbucks the world’s largest beer company is making another investment in the nonalcoholic beverage segment anheuserbusch inbev today announced plans to acquire hiball inc a san franciscobased beverage company founded in  that markets a range of caffeinated beverages including energy drinks sparkling waters and cold brew coffees the company also makes a line of noncaffeinated juices and seltzers called alta palla “we are thrilled to partner with a company that shares our vision for where we can take hiball energy and alta palla in the future and brings real passion and dedication to their work every day” hiball founder todd berardi said in a press release “this deal is the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for me and my team and i can’t wait to get started” specific financial terms were not disclosed but anheuserbusch ceo joão castro neves said his company would purchase  percent of hiball inc in a deal that would be structured to include earnouts and various growth incentives the two companies expect the transaction to close during the third quarter of  “todd alyssa dan and the entire hiball team have created an incredible business developing some of the fastestgrowing brands in the beverage industry and giving their loyal consumers the choices they love” castro neves said via a press release “we are very happy to partner with these three entrepreneurs and invest to help them achieve their dreams” the purchase comes about  months after ab agreed to manufacture and distribute a readytodrink version of starbucks’ popular teavana product in an interview with brewbound castro neves said both the hiball investment and ab’s partnership with starbucks are part of a broader strategy aimed at “growing beyond beer” and a “desire” to advance the company’s position in the nonalcoholic space — a process that began about two years ago “part of the duediligence was to know where growth was going to come from” he said “we saw premium readytodrink tea being a place that is growing but we also see big growth coming from other areas in the future we also saw energy and sparkling waters those three more than anything else were growing fast” according to data from market research iri worldwide sales of energy drinks were up about  percent during the week period ending may  sales of sparkling waters and teas meanwhile were up  percent and  percent respectively during the same period the acquisition of hiball does more than give ab a foothold in the growing energy and sparkling water categories it enables the beer company to supply its nationwide distributor network with a broader array of nonalcoholic offerings particularly an energy drink something wholesalers lost in  when cocacola paid more than  billion for a  percent stake in monster beverage corporation as part of that deal coke and monster amended their distribution agreement in the us and pulled the energy drink brand from many ab wholesalers who had played a key role in growing sales at independent retailers and onpremise accounts “one of the things that we bring to the table is this amazing wholesaler network and our focus on route to market” castro neves said “we have been discussing this nonalcoholic strategy with them for the past two years and they all like that a lot” berardi who spoke to ab wholesalers during a conference call this morning described ab distributors as being “hungry for nonalcoholic items” “that makes us even more excited about this partnership” he said “we all want to create something big and that is what makes this partnership so exciting for our team” in the press release david stokes the ceo of grey eagle distributors and the chair of ab’s wholesaler advisory panel praised the deal calling hiball a “great addition” to his company’s “developing” nonalcoholic portfolio “we have been asking ab for a partnership opportunity just like this” he said “adding these outstanding brands to our wholesaler system increases the breadth of our product portfolio and strengthens our network as we offer more innovation to our customers” castro neves stressed however that the purchase of hiball wasn’t driven by a need to “replace” monster in the ab network instead he said it was a strategic move aimed at complementing ab’s already expansive beer portfolio “the fact that the ab network did so well — and according to everyone i spoke with they are part of the explanation on monster’s success – it gives me the confidence that if we have done it once we can do it twice” castro neves said of bringing a nonalcoholic beverage brand to market “high growth and high margins is something that they wholesalers look for and therefore i think it will be a winwin for all of us” he added hiball is distributed in  states with a mix of natural products distributors including unfi and kehe berardi told brewbound ab is planning a “phased transition” of hiball brands into its network but an official timeline was not disclosed hiball’s products will continue to be made at existing us copacking facilities berardi added but that could change over the next  months as ab determines if it will make additional brewery investments that would improve its ability to produce nonalcoholic drinks “now is about planning the next phase” castro neves said “this will come into discussion at a point in time but we are focusing on the topline right now” all  hiball employees will remain with the company berardi said and michael taylor the current vice president of abi’s north america zone will transition into a new role as the head hiball and alta palla he will also continue to serve on the board of directors for craft brew alliance which is  percent owned by ab but that position could be reevaluated castro neves said editor’s note a version of this story also appeared on bevnetcom  latest news to promote ‘a

more excited about this partnership” he said “we all want to create something big and that is what makes this partnership so exciting for our team” in the press release david stokes the ceo of grey eagle distributors and the chair of ab’s wholesaler advisory panel praised the deal calling hiball a “great addition” to his company’s “developing” nonalcoholic portfolio “we have been asking ab for a partnership opportunity just like this” he said “adding these outstanding brands to our wholesaler system increases the breadth of our product portfolio and strengthens our network as we offer more innovation to our customers” castro neves stressed however that the purchase of hiball wasn’t driven by a need to “replace” monster in the ab network instead he said it was a strategic move aimed at complementing ab’s already expansive beer portfolio “the fact that the ab network did so well — and according to everyone i spoke with they are part of the explanation on monster’s success – it gives me the confidence that if we have done it once we can do it twice” castro neves said of bringing a nonalcoholic beverage brand to market “high growth and high margins is something that they wholesalers look for and therefore i think it will be a winwin for all of us” he added hiball is distributed in  states with a mix of natural products distributors including unfi and kehe berardi told brewbound ab is planning a “phased transition” of hiball brands into its network but an official timeline was not disclosed hiball’s products will continue to be made at existing us copacking facilities berardi added but that could change over the next  months as ab determines if it will make additional brewery investments that would improve its ability to produce nonalcoholic drinks “now is about planning the next phase” castro neves said “this will come into discussion at a point in time but we are focusing on the topline right now” all  hiball employees will remain with the company berardi said and michael taylor the current vice president of abi’s north america zone will transition into a new role as the head hiball and alta palla he will also continue to serve on the board of directors for craft brew alliance which is  percent owned by ab but that position could be reevaluated castro neves said editor’s note a version of this story also appeared on bevnetcom  latest news
