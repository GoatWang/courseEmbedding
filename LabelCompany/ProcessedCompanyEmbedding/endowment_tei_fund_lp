of such audit decrease such partner�s capital account balance by the amount of any overpayment or increase such partner�s capital account balance by the amount of any underpayment as applicable the repurchase of interests is subject to regulatory requirements imposed by the sec the fund�s repurchase procedures are intended to comply with such requirements however in the event that the board determines that modification of the repurchase procedures described above is required or appropriate the board will adopt revised repurchase procedures as necessary to ensure the fund�s compliance with applicable regulations or as the board in its sole discretion deems appropriate following the commencement of an offer to repurchase interests the fund may suspend postpone or terminate such offer in certain circumstances upon the determination of a majority of the board including a majority of the independent directors that such suspension postponement or termination is advisable for the fund and its partners including without limitation circumstances as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable for the fund to dispose of its investments or to determine the value of its net assets and other unusual circumstances each partner whose interest or portion thereof has been accepted for repurchase will continue to be a partner of the fund until the valuation date and thereafter if its interest is repurchased in part and may exercise its voting rights with respect to the repurchased interest or portion thereof until the valuation date moreover the capital account maintained in respect of a partner whose interest or portion thereof has been accepted for repurchase will be adjusted for the net profits or net losses of the fund through the valuation date and such partner�s capital account shall not be adjusted for the amount withdrawn as a result of the repurchase prior to the valuation date upon its acceptance of tendered interests or portions of interests for repurchase the fund will maintain daily on its books a segregated account consisting of �cash �liquid securities or �interests in investment funds that the fund has requested be withdrawn or any combination of them in an amount equal to the aggregate estimated unpaid dollar amount of the promissory notes issued to partners tendering interests and portions of interests �  payments for repurchased interests may require the fund to liquidate portfolio holdings in investment funds earlier than the adviser otherwise would liquidate such holdings potentially resulting in losses a reduction in the fund�s tax efficiency and may increase the fund�s portfolio turnover the adviser intends to take measures to attempt to avoid or minimize such potential losses and turnover the fund may but need not maintain cash or borrow money to meet repurchase requests such a practice could increase the fund�s operating expenses and impact the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective a  early repurchase fee will be charged by the fund and inure to the benefit of the remaining partners with respect to any repurchase of an interest or portion thereof from a partner at any time prior to the business day immediately preceding the oneyear anniversary of the partner�s purchase of such interest or portion thereof partial interests tendered for repurchase will be treated as having been repurchased on a �first in�first out� basis therefore the portion of an interest repurchased will be deemed to have been taken from the earliest capital contribution made by such partner adjusted for subsequent net profits and net losses until that capital contribution is decreased to zero and then from each subsequent capital contribution made by such partner adjusted for subsequent net profits and net losses until such capital contribution is decreased to zero other than the early repurchase fee the fund does not presently intend to impose any charges except for direct costs and expenses such as wiring fees on the repurchase of interests although it may allocate to partners whose interests are repurchased withdrawal or similar charges imposed by investment funds if the adviser determines to withdraw from one or more investment funds as a result of partner repurchase tenders and such charges are imposed on the fund a partner who tenders some but not all of the partner�s interest for repurchase will be required to maintain a minimum capital account balance of  such minimum capital account balance requirement may be waived by the fund in its sole discretion the fund reserves the right to reduce the amount to be repurchased from a partner so that the required capital account balance is maintained in the event that the adviser or any of its affiliates holds an interest or portion of an interest in its capacity as a partner such interest or portion of an interest may be tendered for repurchase in connection with any repurchase offer made by the fund

to extend the period of time during which the offer is pending by notifying investors of such extension if the fund elects to extend the offer to purchase the estimated net asset value of such interests will be determined approximately one month after the offer to purchase actually expires during any such extension all interests previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to

not to purchase or pay for any interests tendered pursuant to the offer b�amend the offer or c�postpone the acceptance of tendered interests if the fund determines to amend the offer or to postpone the acceptance of interests tendered it will to the extent necessary extend the period of time during which the offer is open as provided above and will promptly notify investors vi interests may be withdrawn at any time before  midnight central standard time february�  and if tendered interests have not then been accepted by the fund at any time after february�  �  vii investors wishing to tender interests pursuant to the offer should generally send or deliver a completed and executed letter of transmittal the tender offer form will suffice to the investment adviser to the attention of tef fund operations at the address set forth on page  of the offer to purchase or fax a completed and executed letter of transmittal to the investment adviser also to the attention of tef fund operations at the fax number set forth in item� of the offer to purchase investors whose broker of record is a merrill financial adviser should send or deliver or fax the completed and executed letter of transmittal the tender offer form will suffice to their financial adviser instead of to the investment adviser the completed and executed letter of transmittal must be received either by mail or by fax no later than the expiration date the fund recommends that all documents be submitted by certified mail return receipt requested or by facsimile transmission an investor choosing to fax a letter of transmittal must also send or deliver the original completed and executed letter of transmittal the tender offer form will suffice promptly thereafter any investor tendering an interest pursuant to this offer may withdraw its tender at any time on or before on the expiration date and if interests have not then been accepted by the fund at any time after february�  to be effective any notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the investment adviser at the address or fax numbers set forth in item� of the offer to purchase or in the case of merrill clients by their merrill financial adviser a form to use to give notice of withdrawal is available by calling in the case of merrill clients their merrill financial adviser or for all other investors the investment adviser at the phone number indicated on page  of the offer to purchase interests properly withdrawn shall not thereafter be deemed to be tendered for purposes of the offer however withdrawn interests may be retendered prior to the expiration date by following the procedures described above viii for purposes of the offer the fund will be deemed to have accepted and thereby purchased interests that are tendered when it gives oral or written notice to the tendering investor of its election to purchase such interests ix if more than the maximum amount of interests are duly tendered to the fund prior to the expiration of the offer and not withdrawn the fund will in its sole discretion either a�accept the additional interests permitted to be accepted pursuant to rule efii under the securities exchange act of  as amended b�extend the offer if necessary and increase the amount of interests that the fund is offering to purchase to an amount it believes sufficient to accommodate the excess interests tendered as well as any interests tendered during the extended offer or c�accept interests tendered on or before the expiration date for payment on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate estimated net asset value of tendered interests x the purchase of interests pursuant to the offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the fund of investors who do not tender interests investors who retain their interests may be subject to increased risks that may possibly result from the reduction in the fund�s aggregate assets resulting from payment for the interests tendered these risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification however the fund believes that this result is unlikely given the nature of the fund�s investment program additionally a reduction in the aggregate assets of the fund may result in higher costs for remaining investors to the extent that certain expenses borne by the fund are relatively fixed and may not decrease if assets decline these effects may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that additional subscriptions for interests are made by new and existing investors from time to time xi not applicable xii an investor who tenders its entire interest to the fund for repurchase generally will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by such investor and such investor�s adjusted tax basis in its interest gain if any will be recognized by a tendering investor only as and after the total proceeds received by such investor exceed the investor�s adjusted tax basis in its interest a loss if any will be recognized only after the tendering investor has received full payment this capital gain or loss will be shortterm or longterm depending upon the investor�s holding period for its interest at the time the gain or loss is recognized however a tendering investor will recognize ordinary income to the �  extent such investor�s allocable share of the fund�s �unrealized receivables� exceeds the investor�s basis in such unrealized receivables as determined pursuant to the united states treasury regulations for these purposes accrued but untaxed market discount if any on securities held by the fund will be treated as an unrealized receivable with respect to the tendering investor an investor who tenders less than its entire interest to the fund for repurchase will recognize gain but not loss in a similar manner only to the extent that the amount of the proceeds received exceeds such investor�s adjusted tax basis in its interest pursuant to the authority granted to it under the lp agreement the investment adviser intends to specially allocate items of fund capital gain including shortterm capital gain to a withdrawing investor to the extent its liquidating distribution would otherwise exceed its adjusted tax basis in its interest such a special allocation may result in the withdrawing investor recognizing capital gain which may include shortterm gain in the investor�s last taxable year in the fund thereby reducing the amount of any longterm capital gain recognized during the tax year in which it receives its liquidating distribution upon withdrawal  not applicable b at the present time the fund is not aware of any intentions of the investment adviser or any of the managers or members of the board of the fund to have their interests acquired in this tender offer item� past contracts transactions negotiations and agreements with respect to the issuer�s securities the fund�s ppm and
