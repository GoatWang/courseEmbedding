pncsrth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th dear fellow shareholder in the past year despite a difficult investment environment our funds have continued to perform in a generally satisfactory manner today however we face a major uncertainty to the economic and financial outlook largely because of the imbalance of the us balance of payments and the increased pressure it is putting on the dollar over the last twoandahalf years the dollar has declined about  against the european euro  against the japanese yen  against the british pound and  against the canadian dollar over the same period the us currency has also depreciated about  against the taiwanese dollar  against the singapore dollar  against the thai baht and  against the south korean won more recently over the last  months it even lost more than  against the brazilian real although that currency had previously suffered a severe crisis and devaluation so that the parity between the two currencies is roughly back to where it was in mid on a tradeweighted basis the dollar is down only  from its high of recent years partly this is because it has gained  against the mexican peso but also because it has not moved at all against the chinese renminbi which is pegged to it in recent weeks however the depreciation of the us currency has accelerated as speculation mounted that the chinese renminbi would soon be unpegged and thus de facto revalued it is not at all clear how much benefit will accrue to us trade from the recent and prospective revaluations of most of its main trading partners currencies one reason is that wage rates in many lessdeveloped economies are so much lower than in the united states the other is that many of these countries costs particularly imported oil and other commodities are priced in dollars but a lesser need or desire on the part of foreign central banks to intervene in the currencies markets in support of the dollar is certain to have a significant influence on international capital flows the strong economic growth and buoyant financial markets enjoyed by the united states in recent years have been made possible by the absorption of large amounts of capital from abroad a drought in these inflows would inevitably result in lower economic growth for the united states as well as upward pressure on us interest rates and downward pressure on us priceearnings ratios the impact on economies and financial markets abroad is also likely to be significant although difficult to evaluate at this time most major companies operate in many international markets and the impact positive or negative of these developments on their sales and profits cannot be taken for granted as usual we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to carefully analyze individual companies in a fundamental longterm perspective this is a challenge and opportunity that we look forward to assuming on your behalf respectfully s francois sicart chairman download table annual report  pncsrth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the tocqueville fund  dear fellow shareholder like most mutual funds our fiscal year ends on october  thus the results of the election were not known at the time we closed our books for the year as of the thirtyfirst the election was considered a tossup and this uncertainty was reflected in the market while the tocqueville funds performance over the twelvemonth period  was very gratifying and indeed the overall market as measured by the sp  index put in a very respectable  gain most of the returns came in the first half of the fiscal year during the last six months the fund and the market chalked up more modest gains as investors pondered the direction of the political winds since the election of course the market has rallied smartly as these uncertainties were resolved for the time being at least the market seems to like what it sees regarding economic and international policies of the second term the currency markets on the other hand do not the dollar has been tumbling since the election particularly against the euro from my vantage point this selloff looks like the end of a speculative trade no doubt the dollar has been overowned throughout the world but the euros principle attraction as far as i can tell anyway is that it is not the dollar there is nothing inherently attractive about the euro or for that matter the european economies when compared with the us so it would be difficult to argue that the dollar is weakening because investors are rushing into european investments rather it seems more likely that middle east governments flush with extra dollars from the runup in oil prices during the autumn along with their asian counterparts have decided to diversify their bond holdings by adding euro bonds to their portfolios after the steep rise of the euro from  cents to  it seems likely that the urge to diversify may diminish this coupled with the decline in oil prices and hence petro dollars should put a lid on the euro for the near term what does this all have to do with stocks in general and our stocks in particular well for one thing it may indicate that our natural resource names like phelps dodge murphy oil inco alcoa and teck cominco which have been such strong performers for the fund over the past year may be due for a pause even a correction we have been lightening up on these names on the way up but we still hold sizeable positions for the long term we want to remain positioned in these shares since we believe the great bull market in financial assets has come to an end and a bull market in real assets will follow but these are not the most contrarian of names at this point in time and they are not where we are finding the best values to that point we have been adding to our incipient position in technology stocks where we have been attracted to the pristine balance sheets huge cash generating abilities and strong market positions stocks like microsoft cisco and intel to mention three of the most prominent so dearly loved not long ago when they were trading at stratospheric prices and multiples have fallen out of favor and look attractive from a value investors point of view recent merger and acquisition activity in this space to borrow a term vastly overused in the tech bubble confirms our view that there is value to be found here secondly we would not be surprised to see bargain hunting on the part of foreign investors in us markets in the months ahead us stocks real estate and other dollar denominated assets may begin to look attractive to foreigners sitting on a currency that has appreciated by more than  per cent against the dollar over the past two and a half years continued interest rate rises by the fed could abet this trend the huge rally in the market in calendar  when your fund recorded a  return compared with  for the sp  was in our opinion a rebound from the deeply oversold market in calendar  when the fund declined by  and the sp  by  in  we would have been happy to preserve the remarkable gains of the year before so we are more than gratified with recent results the next awful terrorist event could still happen at anytime of course but aside from that the equity markets appear to this observer anyway to have returned at last to business as usual after some tumultuous years we would expect more muted results in the years ahead as well as the eventual rise in interest rates and corresponding decline in pe ratios counter balance growing profits and a growing worldwide economy other than an unpredictable terrorist threat we see nothing to suggest that the economic recovery in place in the us will stall although it may well slow down in this stockpickers environment we are confident that our riskaverse contrarian value multicap approach will serve the patient and longterm investor well as large shareholders of the fund ourselves we are comfortable with that approach and we thank

valuebased investment strategies of managing for the longterm as opposed to trying to outperform any index over the shortterm i will try my very best to maintain these levels of performance in the future and hopefully do better next year dividend declared we were fortunate to take some gains early in the year as a result the fund will declare a yearend dividend of approximately  or  per share consisting of longterm gains cautious optimism maintained in retrospect the performance of the fund during this past fiscal year reflects a lack of clear economic progress by some of our most economically sensitive holdings this was partly due to weaker than expected consumer response to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies by the federal reserve system more specifically our strong performance early in the fiscal year was fueled by anticipation of a recovery which became increasingly questionable as the year progressed weak telephone equipment orders announced automobile production cutbacks and weak far east consumer electronic production negatively impacted some of our largest holdings as the year progressed we stuck to the deepvalue strategies that have guided us

stanley eafe index had a total us dollar return of  we began the fiscal year in an environment marked by abundant liquidity synchronized global economic expansion strong corporate earnings growth stubbornly low interest rates and lofty investor sentiment equity markets continued the upward trajectory begun in  through most of the first half of the fiscal year at midyear spirits turned nervous as attention focused on high oil prices instability in the middle east indications that the us fed would finally raise rates and the declaration that the chinese government wished to slow its growth valuations corrected across asset classes abruptly in areas populated by speculative investors like commodities and related stocks and the us dollar recovered for a brief time against the euro yen and other major currencies these concerns soon abated however and the markets globally moved higher and the us dollar lower now these worries have been replaced in the japanese and european markets by concerns that a strong currency will dampen economic growth during the twelve months the european be  index increased by  in local currency terms and the japanese nikkei  increased by  in local currency terms the euro increased by  against the us dollar as the growing trade imbalance and the large fiscal deficit in the us continued to undermine confidence in the dollar during the period certain foreign central banks began marginally to increase their purchases of euros in lieu of dollars the japanese yen increased by  against the us dollar in spite of the japanese central banks persistent efforts to intervene to slow the yens appreciation asian markets were up  in us dollar terms the eafe outperformed the sp  in us dollar terms by nearly  during the period we increased our holdings in europe where we continue to discover highly cashgenerative old economy companies like dredging leader boskalis westminster that are leaders in their respective markets and trade at depressed valuations we also increased our holdings of undervalued special situations such as food ingredients company csm where there is a known catalyst for value realization we decreased our exposure to japan as certain of our holdings such as makita and shimano reached our valuation objectives though we increased our exposure to domestic economy oriented stocks such as security systems company secom that will benefit from a pickup in price inflation and consumer spending we maintained a significant exposure to nonjapan asia our strategy there includes purchasing stocks of nonchinese companies that conduct a significant portion of their business in china and are characterized by more attractive valuations and stronger corporate governance than their chinese peers looking forward we are as concerned as ever about the global imbalances we have cited during the last two years to recap we believe that growth in the us has been achieved in part through massive monetary and fiscal stimulation which should produce higher interest rates with negative implications for consumer behavior equity valuations and the us dollar we expect that the asian currencies which tend to be us dollar linked and have depreciated against the european currencies will be pressured to revalue upward this however will not correct the us current account deficit which will only be remedied by a reduction of us domestic consumption as growth in the us slows it will become more challenging for companies that export to the us to generate growth in earnings and cash flow however in our view the challenges posed by stronger domestic currencies in japan and europe will provide added impetus to the economic reforms and corporate restructuring activities that we have noted in recent years this in turn will continue to create good investment opportunities for disciplined valueoriented investors regardless of what might happen in the us we do expect that asia and in particular china will continue to grow well with domestic demand comprising an ever larger part of that growth in general we expect the nonus markets to benefit from improving corporate governance and management practices the development of local equity cultures declining macroeconomic risk premiums and positive capital flows against this background inefficient pricing of equities particularly among small and midcap companies can provide exceptional opportunities we continue to employ our investment discipline seeking to discover fundamentally attractive companies that are out of favor and undervalued and to provide our shareholders with above average returns with below average risk respectfully s james hunt s james hunt francois sicart portfolio manager portfolio manager download table  october

october   gold bullion has increased  in us dollar terms while the total return of the xau benchmark index philadelphia stock exchange gold and silver index was  the sp  return for the twelvemonth period ended october   was  over the same twelve months the total return of the tocqueville gold fund was  during the previous two years ended october   the total return of gold mining shares xau outperformed that of metal by a substantial margin rising  vs  although the fund has outperformed its benchmark index xau by a substantial amount over the last three fiscal years ended october    vs  we slightly under performed  vs  in the most recent fiscal year the reason for this lag was our over weighting of the south african shares which under performed due to the exceptionally strong rand prominent among last years developments was the significant decline in the tradeweighted dollar it is currently trading at the lowest level since   as of this writing down by  vs its peak of  in  however this index only reflects the dollars exchange value against the yen euro and other floating currencies it does not reflect its value against those currencies that are pegged to the dollar including the chinese renminbi the indian rupee and other important asian currencies conventional analysis would have us believe that dollar weakness will correct the massive trade imbalances between the us and the rest of the world as long as there is no upward adjustment of the asian currencies where the largest balance of payments deficits exist this conventional wisdom does not appear to hold true a weak dollar against the euro and yen is unlikely to remedy the unbridled export of us dollars in return for goods and services provided to the american consumer by asia confusion over this issue has led in part to the cooption of gold as a surrogate for the euro by the typical trading desk this explains the correlation between the euro and gold versus the us dollar from december of  to september of  the euro rose approximately  against the dollar while gold rose approximately  however since september of  gold began to outperform the euro vs the dollar and on december   gold is trading at  eurosounce gold needs only to trade above  euros to break out as it has already done in yen we believe a eurogold breakout would signify that the bull market in gold has shifted to a higher gear and that the euro is just another paper currency with as many or more flaws than the us dollar a eurogold breakout will likely herald the rise of gold against all forms of paper assets which it has been doing in stealth fashion since  money flows into gold and gold shares halting and skeptical during the past five years should expand dramatically at this point gold should outperform all other currencies as well as so called hard asset plays the newly introduced gold etf on the nyse tickergld should facilitate money flows into physical metal gld is a grantor trust backed by physical gold when a new share is created the dealer group must purchase physical gold to back it the gold is held in a london vault in the past price quotes for gold were primarily for paper derivatives of the real thing primarily futures contracts or gold linked notes issued by money center banks it would not take much of a diversion of capital from paper assets to physical gold to drive the price well into digit territory global financial assets exceed  trillion the market cap of physical gold assuming all central bank gold is for sale which it is not is around  trillion if  of global financial assets chose to migrate to physical gold it would represent a call on two years of global mine production that trade would be impossible to execute at current prices of course the real market cap of gold taking central bank reserves out of the picture is substantially less than  trillion it is worth noting than in previous bear markets for paper assets the ratio of gold to paper was not  to  but  to   and  to   backup math for all of this is contained in our recent paper beardlsey rumls road to ruin that is posted on our website wwwtocquevillecom while these calculations may be of some interest they are irrelevant unless investors desire to transfer some portion of their wealth from paper to tangible assets let me suggest a few reasons why this could happen financial assets are generally overvalued bonds with yields at historically low levels due to irresponsible monetary policy stand at the precipice of a secular bear market the overvalued dollar results in global financial imbalances that are unsustainable when the rest of the world decides to stop buying us paper the us government and american consumers will have to become selffinancing rising interest rates and rising inflation will be inescapable what will that do to equity market valuations nothing good i can assure you this is a very short list as to why safetyseeking capital might find its way into gold over the next several years global monetary authorities have skillfully deferred a reckoning for the trillions of dollars of capital misdirected by the mispricing of interest rates and currencies over the past two decades their heroic feats will ultimately be in vain as market forces prevail in the end one is always entitled to hope for a muddle through scenario but the resolution of financial excesses and imbalances has historically involved some pain we should hope for the best but in case those hopes are disappointed some exposure to gold seems like a good idea we appreciate your support and interest over the past year we will continue to work diligently to make sure that the tocqueville gold fund continues to provide exposure to the opportunities we

levels abiding by our plan to use these resources at lower prices anticipated later in the year recall that this is our first full year and that we have invested our cash cautiously throughout the year in the coming  months i would expect results to reflect a more fully invested portfolio a year ago you may recall that our perspective on the market while being positive longterm was a bit more defensive than normal as the year began as expected market action tried the patience of most investors across more than a few sectors the lows for the year were reached in august when the fund hit a low point of  per share down  from its offering price we viewed this as an opportunity to utilize our large cash reserve going into august the fund had in excess of  of its assets in cash as we ended october that cash level was more than cut in half equity exposure increased from  of the portfolio to over  my sense today is that the consensus viewpoint for  appears to be almost exactly opposite of that when  dawned then most investors around the globe saw few problems and expected prices to continue to move higher than at the pace seen in  as the year wore on historically low interest rates created huge channels of liquidity and drove demand higherfollowed by raw materials cost increases the growing concern of rapidly rising oil prices added to other pressures and the result was several months of difficult market conditions capped within the longest running trade range seen in the last  years now as we plan for  the crowd is full of concern swamped by bad headlines and negative news the search for opportunity seems to be abandoned by most investors in the face of dire predictions about our collective futures to control risk the number of positions in our portfolio remains relatively high my work suggests that market conditions while unfolding as expected and beginning to improve are likely to provide a few more bouts of weakness as the data on growth builds for a better  this improvement is more likely to be apparent as we approach the latter stages of q as earnings reports may then be set to exceed reduced expectations we anticipate using the next two quarters to pare the number of positions and build depth in the sectors that we believe are showing better relative strength and stronger performance on the fundamental corporate level as such one should expect to see the portfolio move from one with shallow levels of ownership in many companies to one with deeper levels of commitment in fewer companies current market conditions are focused on two extremeswith the data hinting that both are near a turning point on the plus side is the extreme level of enthusiasm for anything oilrelated crude oil markets have seen much press this year and it has become obvious to many that gains are assured as such we continue to tread lightly in that sector even though we expect the shakeout to yield opportunity for positioning longerterm on those setbacks on the other extreme the negative bias toward technology appears to be taking hold as a final acceptance that tech is like any other sector it does not grow to the sky downgrades have been rampant in recent weeks consequently we feel the longerterm investor can now find opportunity to build positions in this sector for better performance in  and beyond another wild card now is the us dollar while my reviews suggest that momentum and the speculative nature of markets may bring about some additional weakness nearterm we feel that the seeds of the next wave of opportunity are being planted as the press focus on this issue reaches its zenith we believe that the dollar weakness concern of today will become a growth and demand opportunity later in  as such we will seek to continue using weak periods to build in sectors that should benefit from this shift however frustrating our first month period of fund activity has proven to be i am confident that our choice to take a slow path to full investment in the fund has helped us to sidestep major portions of the choppy environment experienced in fiscal  and to position in the sectors we feel are set to surprise on the growth side for  and beyond i thank you for the opportunity to serve your investment needs and to work prudently toward your goals our journey together is still very young while the path before us will undoubtedly have a few bumps i believe that the current fearlaced environment will again prove to be exaggerated as this becomes evident the steps we will take to build positions during the first two
