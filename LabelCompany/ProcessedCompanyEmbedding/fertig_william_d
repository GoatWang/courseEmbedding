businessman wendell fertig  december  –  march  was an american civil engineer in the americanadministered commonwealth of the philippines who organized and commanded an americanfilipino guerrilla force on the japaneseoccupied southern philippine island of mindanao during world war ii fertig held a us army reserve commission and was called into military service before the war in the pacific began ordered from corregidor before its surrender to the japanese he was sent to mindanao to assume command of engineer activities there almost as soon as he arrived the us army forces on mindanao surrendered but fertig refused to do so fertig used his knowledge of the filipino people to organize them into a guerrilla army and civilian government he also used his engineering knowledge to solve problems in supply and construction fertig led the guerrillas against the japanese and their collaborators mostly in hitandrun raids and vital coast watching activities after making contact with us forces in the pacific the guerrillas began to receive supplies but never enough to stage large scale attacks more than once the japanese tried to destroy fertig and his guerrilla army committing large numbers of troops for this purpose at these times fertig had his forces retreat before the japanese until they were also dispersed then counterattacked the japanese with local superiority in numbers this continued until american forces returned to the philippines after the war fertig returned to his civilian engineering career but retained his reserve commission he spent four years as commander of the rotc detachment at the colorado school of mines his alma mater and served in a usbased psychological warfare unit during the korean war leaving active duty in the mids he ran a successful colorado mining company until his death during his postwar years he was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao and was a highly respected figure among the us special forces one authority lists him among the top ten guerrilla leaders in history contents  prewar  world war ii  early war experiences  avoiding capture  organizing the resistance  fighting the japanese  postwar  popular culture  decorations  see also  citations  references  external links prewaredit wendell fertig was born in la junta colorado where he lived until he completed high school he then studied engineering at the colorado school of mines in golden colorado after graduation from college he married his wife mary in  he and his family moved to the philippines where he had a successful career as a civil engineer until the war broke out fertig was described as tall sandyhaired with an athletic build and being calm genial deliberate and possessing a remarkable memory and a great facility for remembering names his experience as an engineer  and methods of attacking problems would serve him in the challenges he would face as the leader of the mindanao guerrillas it was due primarily to his personal leadership qualities that the mindanao resistance movement was unified under one leader and became the most successful of all the guerrilla units in the philippines early in  fertig was on leave in manila from his job on samar due to his military classes in college he held a reserve commission in the united states army corps of engineers as a result he was called to duty on  june  as a captain reserve in the army engineers as the united states prepared for war in the pacific theater at that time us analysts believed that the philippines might be one of the first areas japan would attack fertigs first assignments were as assistant engineer bataan field area then as engineer north luzon area by november  he was chief of the construction section general headquarters and spent most of his time overseeing preparation and improvement of airfields throughout the philippines in late  the us began evacuating the wives and children of military families in january  according to one of fertigs daughters mary fertig and their two children patricia hudson and jeannne left on the last evacuation ship and returned to the united states however other sources have fertigs family leaving the philippines as early as the summer of  this action was taken to relieve the concerns of officers and enlisted men called to duty about the welfare of their families american civilian families men women and children were not evacuated so as not to lessen the morale of the citizens of the philippines the native people of the philippines who could not leave suffered terribly under the japanese occupation it is estimated that at least one out of every  filipinos died at the hands of the japanese during the occupation world war iiedit early war experiencesedit on  december  japanese troops invaded the philippines among fertigs duties during the retreat to bataan and corregidor was the destruction of supplies left behind by retreating american forces his attention to detail was such that he even drove his new dodge car off a pier and into manila bay promoted twice by april  fertig—by then a lieutenant colonel—was sent from bataan on luzon to mindanao by general edward p king luzon force commander to assist general william f sharp mindanao force commander in the construction of airfields in they fought alone the author states that lt colonel fertig was ordered off corregidor to join general douglas macarthurs headquarters in australia however since he was not known to members of macarthurs headquarters in australia it is probably correct that he was ordered to mindanao to assist american forces there fertig arrived on mindanao on  april  and was assigned to supervise the demolition of main roads and bridges to prevent their use by the japanese avoiding captureedit after the us forces in and around the island of luzon surrendered in may  fertig decided not to give himself up to the japanese when another fleeing officer accompanying him asked what they were going to do fertig replied any damn thing but surrender during his movement from corregidor to mindanao fertig survived or avoided a number of airplane crashes as a result he felt that he was destined for something special later after organizing the guerrilla forces on mindanao he wrote in this diary i am called on to lead a resistance movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances but i feel that i am indeed a man of destiny that my course is charted and that only success lies at the end of the trail i do not envision failure it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time in the end we will be successful colonel fertig wearing red goatee during the war upon learning of the surrender of the american forces under general wainwright fertig spent weeks crossing the mountains and jungles in an attempt to contact general sharp upon learning that sharp had surrendered his forces to the japanese on  may  fertig then spent more weeks considering his options realizing that to gain face and authority he had to wait until guerrillas contacted him fertig monitored the military and political situation in mindanao by means of the jungle telegraph fertig also grew a red goatee believing that it would make him look older and wiser among a people who believed that age brought wisdom to the filipinos fertig would become known simply as tatay father many of the emerging guerrilla forces at that time were simply bandit groups pretending to fight the japanese but really using the collapse of the americansupported government to set themselves up as rulers of local areas these groups competed with each other for territory and authority on  september  the leader of one strong group approached fertig hoping to use him as a front ie representing american military forces to assume authority over the entire island fertig consented but then used his knowledge of the filipino people and the current situation in mindanao to eventually take over the command of that group and then others recognizing that he needed a higher rank so he would be taken seriously by potential recruits to his struggle including the leaders of other existing guerrilla bands fertig promoted himself to brigadier general this selfpromotion to brigadier general did not endear him to general macarthur or his staff but macarthur did send logistical support to fertig throughout  and  organizing the resistanceedit japanese bombings destruction by retreating american troops deprivations by bandit guerrilla bands and hoarding by civilians had significantly reduced available war supplies as well as those items necessary to run an effective government fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped americans and resisting filipinos to create many supplies from scratch for example tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for  caliber rifles steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles money was printed in both english and the local language using wooden blocks and fisherman towed japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel often seemingly impossible problems were overcome simply through perseverance for example gerardo almendres a filipino high school student had sent away for an international correspondence schools course on radios shortly before the war started fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though almendres had never handled one almendres was assisted by a filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another filipino who once had listened to a radio radio parts vacuum tubes and other electrical parts were scrounged from old radio receivers and sound equipment from an old movie projector and other electrical devices their makeshift radio eventually worked and they began to receive transmissions from other radios including those of roy bell on negros who traveled to fertigs camp and devised a new aerial however they had no way of knowing if their own transmissions were successful until on  january  the us navy radio monitoring station in san francisco answered their call sign robert c ball william f konko and stewart willever jr became fertigs signal corps– this was an extremely important accomplishment as american military commands in the pacific had no idea that there was any effective armed resistance on mindanao or even in the philippines general charles willoughby macarthurs intelligence chief had assured him that there was no possibility of such the american command in the pacific first heard of fertig when the japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed major general fertig but the americans simply dismissed it as propaganda it took weeks before american intelligence was able to confirm who fertig was and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the japanese part of this investigative process involved mary fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husbands life mrs fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last american plane leaving mindanao a phrase in the letter pineapples for breakfast let mrs fertig know that her husband was alive and well on mindanao as that is where they spent short vacations and while there he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast the latest american intelligence had placed fertig on corregidor at the time of the surrender and so the us army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the japanese in february  with tenuous communication established general macarthur appointed fertig as commanding officer of the th military district on mindanao during the initial exchange of messages macarthur disallowed any promotion of american armed forces personnel in the philippines to general rank as a result fertig reduced himself in rank to colonel but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a filipino metalsmith due to the difficulty in communicating with fertig and his command because of the makeshift radio almendres had built a submarine loaded with military and medical supplies was eventually sent to mindanao arriving on  march  it also carried two americans who had known fertig in the philippines one was charles smith who on  december  had escaped with two other americans and two filipinos by sailing a small boat to australia perhaps at that time the longest openboat voyage since captain blighs smith was now a captain in us army intelligence the other was charles parsons formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in us navy intelligence in addition to his other prewar business interests in manila parsons had represented panama as its resident counsel when the japanese occupied manila parsons was careful to speak only spanish and convinced the japanese he was a citizen of panama as a result the japanese eventually sent parsons and his family on a long journey back to panama but when the swedish ship carrying them docked in new york and before he could report to us intelligence fbi agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked parsons who he was and quickly hustled him and his family ashore however another source states that parsons reported to us intelligence in the canal zone after the ship docked in panama it was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the german italian or other legations who knew parsons true citizenship status exposed his masquerade to the japanese their role as smith and parsons immediately explained to fertig was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and if so was it worth the risk of men and supplies to support him at the same time parsons and smith brought fertig some unpleasant orders from macarthurs headquarters the american army was willing to provide radios and other equipment for fertigs command but these were only to be used for passing information on japanese activities from coastwatchers and other sources to australia the guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the japanese fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support however due to the numerous atrocities that the japanese were committing against the philippine population the only way that fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning so as to provide the filipinos an outlet for revenge against the japanese fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the japanese then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with macarthurs headquarters and its directives in addition general charles a willoughby macarthurs chief of intelligence was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources if a regular us army had been defeated by the japanese in the philippines then no irregular force could do better the guerrillas only purpose was to provide intelligence and later if fully equipped prior to the return of american forces to the philippines to fight as regular forces under the command of american officers fertig needed experienced american soldiers to train the filipino guerrillas the almost total lack of supplies was a serious problem but it was not the most pressing problem fertig faced at the time of the japanese invasion most philippine army units were of low quality they were not only poorly trained enough time not having passed to do so but they were underequipped and did not have the firepower to resist better armed japanese troops tanks and planes most of the soldiers were barefoot and many of their world war i era weapons lacked replacement parts and did not operate properly as a result many filipino units fled when attacked by the japanese this was symptomatic of fertigs most pressing need—experienced leaders he knew that eventually numerous leaders would emerge from the filipinos some guerrilla bands already had strong leaders but he needed them now his best resource for this leadership cadre was american servicemen who had either not surrendered or had escaped from prisonerofwar camps many were already fighting as guerrilla leaders or eager to so others joined him after he explained the need for their services but many others were not willing and demanded they be sent to australia where they could rejoin regular units fertigs reaction was not always one of understanding he told many that they would be returned when a means was found but that they would never be allowed to return others he removed from duty when it was apparent they did not have the leadership skills required eventually they were also returned to australia by submarine many with negative reports on their behavior some regular army personnel resented being commanded by a civilian turned soldier even if he had been in the philippines more years than they had many of the younger americans had disobeyed the orders to surrender due to their individualism others had used their cunning to evade the japanese or escape from the pow camps these traits sometimes led to clashes with the older men who had lived in the philippines for years and were now in command positions due to their reserve commissions or promotion by fertig as a result those who departed did not always report favorably on fertig once they reached macarthurs headquarters in australia those who stayed and fought received immediate commissions or were promoted if they already were officers in the us army although they might be sailors marines or even civilians macarthur eventually approved all of fertigs promotions even though advised not to do so by lt colonel courtney whitney his staff officer for filipino civilian affairs fighting the japaneseedit colonel fertig slowly assumed control over more of the existing rival guerrilla units on mindanao and turned them to harassing the japanese over the next two and a half years fertig created and commanded the mindanao segment of the united states forces in the philippines usfip recruiting escaped prisonersofwar and soldiers and american civilians who had refused to surrender however his real strength came from the thousands of patriotic filipinos many of whom were enraged by japanese atrocities who now joined existing or formed new organizations under his command the japanese were not unaware of these activities especially as they began to suffer losses in men and equipment and lose control of large areas between  and  usfip conducted numerous raids against the japanese occupation forces on mindanao in order to both sustain fertigs operation with captured supplies and to carry on harassing operations against the japanese this caused discord between fertig and macarthurs headquarters the american south west pacific area command wanted fertig to man coastwatcher units to report on japanese movements especially shipping as its main effort however to retain the loyalty of his forces in the wake of japanese atrocities fertig also had to wage an active campaign to kill japanese and their collaborators as well as disrupt activities aimed at civilians attacks against the japanese often initiated terrible reprisals by the japanese against local civilians so fertig issued orders that the guerrillas on mindanao were to avoid situations that would result in such reprisals however due to the japanese callousness toward the local populations reprisals often still occurred in addition to ambushing occupying japanese forces filipino guerrillas provided valuable intelligence reports to allied strategists initially fertigs forces were able to repel japanese attempts to recapture territory held by the guerrillas the japanese could not take any major actions against usfip on mindanao as not only were they dealing with other resistance movements in the philippines but most of their combat troops had been deployed to other areas of the pacific however in late spring  the japanese began military actions on a large scale on mindanao in those areas affected usfip forces had to retreat and give up land established camps and government infrastructure to the stronger japanese forces as the guerrilla units and government infrastructure fled before the japanese forces something occurred which fertig had hoped for he called it the pillow effect by providing no resistance to a stronger force the guerrillas survived the japanese blow when the japanese withdrew the pillow expanded to its original shape as the companysized guerrilla units dissolved the japanese began breaking up their units into smaller groups—eventually into squads—to track down these smaller units then without any orders from above first two or three guerrillas then  or more then platoon and then companysized units reorganized and struck back at the smaller japanese units causing the japanese heavy casualties in hundreds of small fire fights the japanese responded by reforming into battalionsized units that needed large towns to support them eventually the japanese using  to  troops on mindanao held the large towns on the sea coast while the usfip held the rest of the countryside or approximately  of the island of mindanao the guerrillas were so effective in some areas local japanese commanders made separate truces with them in exchange for the guerrillas not attacking japanese troops the japanese agreed to stay out of those areas in august  based upon favorable reports to macarthur by parsons and smith fertig was promoted to full colonel by macarthur and received the distinguished service cross for his efforts on  august fertig received the following message in recognition of your meritorious services as district commander and extraordinary heroism in action during the period of  may  to  august  i have awarded you the distinguished service cross announcement of your award is published in go hqs usaffe dtd  august i congratulate you on the distinguished service to your country and to the filipino people that has so well earned for you such recognition and hope that in it you will find inspiration for even greater future service quezon congratulates you on promotion fertig even created a navy by arming several small merchant vessels which he used to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine these vessels also attacked japanese shipping primarily small intercoastal vessels and patrol boats the usfip navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers homemade cannons and even mortars later some used  mm cannons supplied by the us navy one vessel was even armored using large circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large japanese steamer and another a sailing ship armed with  mm cannon fought off japanese aircraft and actually shot one down perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a japanese mitsubishi medium bomber more importantly the crew salvaged a new japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent it out on the next submarine to australia one of fertigs most audacious ship captains was waldo neveling a german civilian soldier of fortune and an enemy alien fertig had commissioned into the us army another ship called the bastard was actually a foot whaleboat captained by australian robert jock mclaren an escaped prisonerofwar from the sandakan pow camp on borneo mclaren would sail his boat into japanese controlled ports in broad daylight shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar then turn tail and run to help prepare for the eventual invasion of american forces fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised one as long as  feet which took over a year to build the airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops all that was needed was a bulldozer to scrape off the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes some of these airstrips were later used by us marine corps squadrons to provide closeair support during the invasion early in  the japanese army once again launched a major effort in an attempt to destroy the guerrillas on mindanao although essentially a repeat of their previous failed efforts they came close to destroying the guerrillas not by eliminating them but by cutting off their sources of supplies this effort came to an abrupt end when the american army and navy launched their longawaited offensive against the philippines with a landing first on leyte and then on  april  on mindanao as the japanese army pulled its troops out of mindanao to defend other portions of the philippines american air and naval forces extracted a terrible toll on japanese shipping killing untold thousands of japanese troops when many of the survivors of the sinking ships swam ashore they found filipino guerrillas and civilians waiting for them on the beaches armed with bolos exhausted from the swim the japanese were unable to fight back against the terrible retribution the filipinos then extracted for the atrocities the japanese had perpetrated against them during the years of occupation the usfip also contributed heavily to coastwatching activities as requested by macarthurs headquarters fertigs coastwatchers provided information leading to the victories in the first battle of the philippine sea the great marianas turkey shoot and the battle of leyte gulf other intelligence gathered by fertigs guerrillas was so accurate aerial reconnaissance flights before attacks were often canceled so as not to warn the japanese the guerrillas often went to great risks to secure accurate information for example they would make pencilandpaper rubbings of the serial numbers on enemy artillery to prove the accuracy of their information however estimates of enemy strength in an area were sometimes unreliable as with the american forces now in the philippines the japanese were constantly moving their forces around to meet the threat lieutenant general robert eichelberger commanding the us eighth army often downplayed guerrilla intelligence but this was throughout the philippines as a whole for the th military district commanded by fertig he had this to say we did have considerable information about dispositions of enemy troop since guerrilla forces on mindanao were the most effective and best organized in the philippines but probably the best estimate of the value of guerrilla intelligence came from the japanese when they released an official communique stating that the americans had perfected a new aerial bomb which was attracted by concentrations of ammunition and fuel the bomb was simply accurate information on japanese installations supplied by the guerrillas as first american carrier planes then longdistance landbased planes began raids on the philippines the guerrillas became important for yet another reason as american pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by japanese antiaircraft fire they often found filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by filipinos in small swift boats often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships debriefing officers within a day or two fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing he knew they were more important flying missions against japanese targets besides colonel fertig now had a good supply of experienced battlehardened american and filipino leaders for his combat patrols the uss narwhal a submarine with a large cargo capacity made supply runs to the philippines from its humble beginnings usfip became one of the best equipped and most effective irregular units operating in world war ii when the submarine uss narwhal arrived at mindanao in nov  to deliver supplies the crew was met by a uniformed band playing stars and stripes forever although submarines had already delivered supplies to fertig and other guerrilla leaders the narwhals large size enabled it to deliver  tons of supplies at a time whereas other submarines could only deliver four tons or less this greatly increased the ability of the guerrilla forces not only to inflict damage to the enemy but also provide the necessary supplies to care for the medical health and wellbeing of the guerrilla forces and their civilian supporters in addition uss narwhal had the room to evacuate guerrillas needing critical medical care as well as american civilians primarily women and children who had been hiding out in the philippines and were suffering from malnutrition and diseases according to us navy records  of  resupply missions to the philippines were directed to mindanao between  january  and  january  for all of the philippines a total of  tons of supplies were landed with  people landed and another  evacuated filipino guerrillas secured airstrips for us planes on mindanao as an indicator of usfip strength on mindanao during january and february  in preparation for the return of regular american forces the guerrillas seized the dipolog airstrip in northern zamboanga and held it while surrounded by the japanese with the arrival of regular american forces in march  fertigs guerrilla forces participated in the battle of mindanao that effectively ended organized japanese resistance on that island they then disbanded on  september  the th infantry division of the philippine commonwealth army was reactivated and its ranks were heavily seeded with filipino veterans of the usfip at all levels of command american forces return to the philippines by late  fertig commanded a force estimated at between  and  effectives with most sources agreeing on —the equivalent of an army corps—with  of them armed officers with responsibility for corps command usually hold the rank of major general in addition fertig created and help administer the civilian government of mindanao while at the same time conducting the guerrilla war against the japanese the usfip killed at least  japanese soldiers and while a constant drain on japanese resources they also prevented the japanese from fully utilizing mindanaos resources in support of its war efforts at one time the japanese committed approximately  troops in an attempt to crush guerrilla resistance on mindanao troops that were desperately needed elsewhere throughout the entire philippines the guerrillas managed to tie down a japanese army of  troops of which approximately – were on mindanao depending on the time period after the war examination of japanese records indicated that the japanese high command felt that  battalions of troops would be needed to guard rear areas against guerrillas once the american invasion of the philippines began since seven divisions were slated to resist the invasion this resulted in a ratio of one reararea soldier to every three frontline troops ultimately the japanese concluded that it is impossible to fight the enemy and at the same time suppress the activities of the guerrillas while summarizing colonel wendell fertigs contributions to the american war effort and his leadership of the usfip on mindanao keats  states apart from his insistence on honesty and justice and the idea that the guerrilla army be a process of a responsible civil government his fundamental contribution to mindanao was his concern that the reward for performance should always be increased responsibility in his command demonstrated competence was the sole means to promotion and no man was denied an opportunity to prove himself this concept built a nation in north america and it built another on mindanao it was fertig more than any other man who gave the filipinos of mindanao increasing reason to believe in themselves this rather than a military victory was fertigs triumph the moro muslim datu pino sliced the ears off japanese and cashed them in with colonel fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and  centavos postwaredit some scholars question why fertig did not receive the medal of honor despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life others question why when fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men who were never in combat received that rank as the us army grew in size william manchester in his  biography of macarthur american caesar offers the opinion that macarthur and his staff may have had their own agenda in minimizing the efforts of fertig other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the philippines for example the american joint chiefs of staff authorized general macarthur to liberate the island of luzon but none of the other philippine islands after capturing luzon macarthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the joint chiefs manchester stated he macarthur wanted to become the liberator of the philippines the japanese armys practice of referring to fertig as major general fertig commander in chief in the philippines throughout the occupation period and its use of japanese military notation in referring to the th military district as the  army group did not endear fertig to macarthurs headquarters manchester also relates that lieutenant colonel courtney whitney an ultraconservative manila corporation lawyer was assigned to macarthurs staff promoted and assigned responsibility for philippine civil affairs manchester wrote from the standpoint of the guerrillas he was a disastrous choice undiplomatic and belligerent he was condescending toward all filipinos except those who like himself had substantial investments in the philippines and by the time macarthur was ready to land on leyte whitney had converted most of the staff to reactionaryism at his urging the general macarthur barred oss agents from the southwest pacific because whitney suspected they would aid leftwing guerrillas by minimizing the efforts of the guerrilla movement in freeing the philippines whitney also robbed it of political clout after the war to make any substantial liberal changes in philippine government and society after the war in may  colonel fertig was awarded the us army distinguished service medal the citation reads in part constantly engaged with vastly superior enemy forces he engendered filipino faith and confidence in their ultimate deliverance instilled in them the will to resist and united them in the cause of freedom by his outstanding courage tireless determination and brilliant leadership colonel fertig made an inestimable contribution to the liberation of the philippine islands after the war fertig spent four years as the officerincharge of rotc at the colorado school of mines a surprisingly lowlevel post after such a distinguished war time career however when the korean war began he spent two years at the pentagon with a psychological warfare unit from july  to june  he was the special forces plans officer in the office of the chief of psychological warfare with headquarters us army then from june  to august  he served as deputy chief of psychological warfare it was during this time that he helped establish the armys psychological warfare center at fort bragg north carolina which later became the john f kennedy special warfare center and school due to his wartime experiences and postwar work fertig is one of three men who used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of sf special forces and is considered one of the founding fathers of the us army special forces colonel fertig was released from active duty in the mids fertig was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao in june  wendell fertig and his wife returned to mindanao on a business trip as the interisland freighter pulled into cagayan the ships captain approached ferting and said sir i think friends await you as numerous small craft full of shouting men surrounded the ship wendell and mary fertig saw thousands of filipinos waiting at the waterfront at cagayan they had come from every corner of mindanao there were masses of women in the white uniforms of the womens auxiliary service and men wearing caps of the philippine veterans legion and the red fezzes of the moros the men were shouting and the women were singing they then saw a huge banner over the pier welcome the indomitable patriot who have lessened human suffering on mindanao wendell fertig ran a successful mining company in colorado until he died on  march  popular cultureedit a movie on wendell fertig has been in the planning stages for several

philippines who organized and commanded an americanfilipino guerrilla force on the japaneseoccupied southern philippine island of mindanao during world war ii fertig held a us army reserve commission and was called into military service before the war in the pacific began ordered from corregidor before its surrender to the japanese he was sent to mindanao to assume command of engineer activities there almost as soon as he arrived the us army forces on mindanao surrendered but fertig refused to do so fertig used his knowledge of the filipino people to organize them into a guerrilla army and civilian government he also used his engineering knowledge to solve problems in supply and construction fertig led the guerrillas against the japanese and their collaborators mostly in hitandrun raids and vital coast watching activities after making contact with us forces in the pacific the guerrillas began to receive supplies but never enough to stage large scale attacks more than once the japanese tried to destroy fertig and his guerrilla army committing large numbers of troops for this purpose at these times fertig had his forces retreat before the japanese until they were also dispersed then counterattacked the japanese with local superiority in numbers this continued until american forces returned to the philippines after the war fertig returned to his civilian engineering career but retained his reserve commission he spent four years as commander of the rotc detachment at the colorado school of mines his alma mater and served in a usbased psychological warfare unit during the korean war leaving active duty in the mids he ran a successful colorado mining company until his death during his postwar years he was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao and was a highly respected figure among the us special forces one authority lists him among the top ten guerrilla leaders in history contents  prewar  world war ii  early war experiences  avoiding capture  organizing the resistance  fighting the japanese  postwar  popular culture  decorations  see also  citations  references  external links prewaredit wendell fertig was born in la junta colorado where he lived until he completed high school he then studied engineering at the colorado school of mines in golden colorado after graduation from college he married his wife mary in  he and his family moved to the philippines where he had a successful career as a civil engineer until the war broke out fertig was described as tall sandyhaired with an athletic build and being calm genial deliberate and possessing a remarkable memory and a great facility for remembering names his experience as an engineer  and methods of attacking problems would serve him in the challenges he would face as the leader of the mindanao guerrillas it was due primarily to his personal leadership qualities that the mindanao resistance movement was unified under one leader and became the most successful of all the guerrilla units in the philippines early in  fertig was on leave in manila from his job on samar due to his military classes in college he held a reserve commission in the united states army corps of engineers as a result he was called to duty on  june  as a captain reserve in the army engineers as the united states prepared for war in the pacific theater at that time us analysts believed that the philippines might be one of the first areas japan would attack fertigs first assignments were as assistant engineer bataan field area then as engineer north luzon area by november  he was chief of the construction section general headquarters and spent most of his time overseeing preparation and improvement of airfields throughout the philippines in late  the us began evacuating the wives and children of military families in january  according to one of fertigs daughters mary fertig and their two children patricia hudson and jeannne left on the last evacuation ship and returned to the united states however other sources have fertigs family leaving the philippines as early as the summer of  this action was taken to relieve the concerns of officers and enlisted men called to duty about the welfare of their families american civilian families men women and children were not evacuated so as not to lessen the morale of the citizens of the philippines the native people of the philippines who could not leave suffered terribly under the japanese occupation it is estimated that at least one out of every  filipinos died at the hands of the japanese during the occupation world war iiedit early war experiencesedit on  december  japanese troops invaded the philippines among fertigs duties during the retreat to bataan and corregidor was the destruction of supplies left behind by retreating american forces his attention to detail was such that he even drove his new dodge car off a pier and into manila bay promoted twice by april  fertig—by then a lieutenant colonel—was sent from bataan on luzon to mindanao by general edward p king luzon force commander to assist general william f sharp mindanao force commander in the construction of airfields in they fought alone the author states that lt colonel fertig was ordered off corregidor to join general douglas macarthurs headquarters in australia however since he was not known to members of macarthurs headquarters in australia it is probably correct that he was ordered to mindanao to assist american forces there fertig arrived on mindanao on  april  and was assigned to supervise the demolition of main roads and bridges to prevent their use by the japanese avoiding captureedit after the us forces in and around the island of luzon surrendered in may  fertig decided not to give himself up to the japanese when another fleeing officer accompanying him asked what they were going to do fertig replied any damn thing but surrender during his movement from corregidor to mindanao fertig survived or avoided a number of airplane crashes as a result he felt that he was destined for something special later after organizing the guerrilla forces on mindanao he wrote in this diary i am called on to lead a resistance movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances but i feel that i am indeed a man of destiny that my course is charted and that only success lies at the end of the trail i do not envision failure it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time in the end we will be successful colonel fertig wearing red goatee during the war upon learning of the surrender of the american forces under general wainwright fertig spent weeks crossing the mountains and jungles in an attempt to contact general sharp upon learning that sharp had surrendered his forces to the japanese on  may  fertig then spent more weeks considering his options realizing that to gain face and authority he had to wait until guerrillas contacted him fertig monitored the military and political situation in mindanao by means of the jungle telegraph fertig also grew a red goatee believing that it would make him look older and wiser among a people who believed that age brought wisdom to the filipinos fertig would become known simply as tatay father many of the emerging guerrilla forces at that time were simply bandit groups pretending to fight the japanese but really using the collapse of the americansupported government to set themselves up as rulers of local areas these groups competed with each other for territory and authority on  september  the leader of one strong group approached fertig hoping to use him as a front ie representing american military forces to assume authority over the entire island fertig consented but then used his knowledge of the filipino people and the current situation in mindanao to eventually take over the command of that group and then others recognizing that he needed a higher rank so he would be taken seriously by potential recruits to his struggle including the leaders of other existing guerrilla bands fertig promoted himself to brigadier general this selfpromotion to brigadier general did not endear him to general macarthur or his staff but macarthur did send logistical support to fertig throughout  and  organizing the resistanceedit japanese bombings destruction by retreating american troops deprivations by bandit guerrilla bands and hoarding by civilians had significantly reduced available war supplies as well as those items necessary to run an effective government fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped americans and resisting filipinos to create many supplies from scratch for example tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for  caliber rifles steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles money was printed in both english and the local language using wooden blocks and fisherman towed japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel often seemingly impossible problems were overcome simply through perseverance for example gerardo almendres a filipino high school student had sent away for an international correspondence schools course on radios shortly before the war started fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though almendres had never handled one almendres was assisted by a filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another filipino who once had listened to a radio radio parts vacuum tubes and other electrical parts were scrounged from old radio receivers and sound equipment from an old movie projector and other electrical devices their makeshift radio eventually worked and they began to receive transmissions from other radios including those of roy bell on negros who traveled to fertigs camp and devised a new aerial however they had no way of knowing if their own transmissions were successful until on  january  the us navy radio monitoring station in san francisco answered their call sign robert c ball william f konko and stewart willever jr became fertigs signal corps– this was an extremely important accomplishment as american military commands in the pacific had no idea that there was any effective armed resistance on mindanao or even in the philippines general charles willoughby macarthurs intelligence chief had assured him that there was no possibility of such the american command in the pacific first heard of fertig when the japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed major general fertig but the americans simply dismissed it as propaganda it took weeks before american intelligence was able to confirm who fertig was and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the japanese part of this investigative process involved mary fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husbands life mrs fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last american plane leaving mindanao a phrase in the letter pineapples for breakfast let mrs fertig know that her husband was alive and well on mindanao as that is where they spent short vacations and while there he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast the latest american intelligence had placed fertig on corregidor at the time of the surrender and so the us army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the japanese in february  with tenuous communication established general macarthur appointed fertig as commanding officer of the th military district on mindanao during the initial exchange of messages macarthur disallowed any promotion of american armed forces personnel in the philippines to general rank as a result fertig reduced himself in rank to colonel but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a filipino metalsmith due to the difficulty in communicating with fertig and his command because of the makeshift radio almendres had built a submarine loaded with military and medical supplies was eventually sent to mindanao arriving on  march  it also carried two americans who had known fertig in the philippines one was charles smith who on  december  had escaped with two other americans and two filipinos by sailing a small boat to australia perhaps at that time the longest openboat voyage since captain blighs smith was now a captain in us army intelligence the other was charles parsons formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in us navy intelligence in addition to his other prewar business interests in manila parsons had represented panama as its resident counsel when the japanese occupied manila parsons was careful to speak only spanish and convinced the japanese he was a citizen of panama as a result the japanese eventually sent parsons and his family on a long journey back to panama but when the swedish ship carrying them docked in new york and before he could report to us intelligence fbi agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked parsons who he was and quickly hustled him and his family ashore however another source states that parsons reported to us intelligence in the canal zone after the ship docked in panama it was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the german italian or other legations who knew parsons true citizenship status exposed his masquerade to the japanese their role as smith and parsons immediately explained to fertig was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and if so was it worth the risk of men and supplies to support him at the same time parsons and smith brought fertig some unpleasant orders from macarthurs headquarters the american army was willing to provide radios and other equipment for fertigs command but these were only to be used for passing information on japanese activities from coastwatchers and other sources to australia the guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the japanese fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support however due to the numerous atrocities that the japanese were committing against the philippine population the only way that fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning so as to provide the filipinos an outlet for revenge against the japanese fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the japanese then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with macarthurs headquarters and its directives in addition general charles a willoughby macarthurs chief of intelligence was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources if a regular us army had been defeated by the japanese in the philippines then no irregular force could do better the guerrillas only purpose was to provide intelligence and later if fully equipped prior to the return of american forces to the philippines to fight as regular forces under the command of american officers fertig needed experienced american soldiers to train the filipino guerrillas the almost total lack of supplies was a serious problem but it was not the most pressing problem fertig faced at the time of the japanese invasion most philippine army units were of low quality they were not only poorly trained enough time not having passed to do so but they were underequipped and did not have the firepower to resist better armed japanese troops tanks and planes most of the soldiers were barefoot and many of their world war i era weapons lacked replacement parts and did not operate properly as a result many filipino units fled when attacked by the japanese this was symptomatic of fertigs most pressing need—experienced leaders he knew that eventually numerous leaders would emerge from the filipinos some guerrilla bands already had strong leaders but he needed them now his best resource for this leadership cadre was american servicemen who had either not surrendered or had escaped from prisonerofwar camps many were already fighting as guerrilla leaders or eager to so others joined him after he explained the need for their services but many others were not willing and demanded they be sent to australia where they could rejoin regular units fertigs reaction was not always one of understanding he told many that they would be returned when a means was found but that they would never be allowed to return others he removed from duty when it was apparent they did not have the leadership skills required eventually they were also returned to australia by submarine many with negative reports on their behavior some regular army personnel resented being commanded by a civilian turned soldier even if he had been in the philippines more years than they had many of the younger americans had disobeyed the orders to surrender due to their individualism others had used their cunning to evade the japanese or escape from the pow camps these traits sometimes led to clashes with the older men who had lived in the philippines for years and were now in command positions due to their reserve commissions or promotion by fertig as a result those who departed did not always report favorably on fertig once they reached macarthurs headquarters in australia those who stayed and fought received immediate commissions or were promoted if they already were officers in the us army although they might be sailors marines or even civilians macarthur eventually approved all of fertigs promotions even though advised not to do so by lt colonel courtney whitney his staff officer for filipino civilian affairs fighting the japaneseedit colonel fertig slowly assumed control over more of the existing rival guerrilla units on mindanao and turned them to harassing the japanese over the next two and a half years fertig created and commanded the mindanao segment of the united states forces in the philippines usfip recruiting escaped prisonersofwar and soldiers and american civilians who had refused to surrender however his real strength came from the thousands of patriotic filipinos many of whom were enraged by japanese atrocities who now joined existing or formed new organizations under his command the japanese were not unaware of these activities especially as they began to suffer losses in men and equipment and lose control of large areas between  and  usfip conducted numerous raids against the japanese occupation forces on mindanao in order to both sustain fertigs operation with captured supplies and to carry on harassing operations against the japanese this caused discord between fertig and macarthurs headquarters the american south west pacific area command wanted fertig to man coastwatcher units to report on japanese movements especially shipping as its main effort however to retain the loyalty of his forces in the wake of japanese atrocities fertig also had to wage an active campaign to kill japanese and their collaborators as well as disrupt activities aimed at civilians attacks against the japanese often initiated terrible reprisals by the japanese against local civilians so fertig issued orders that the guerrillas on mindanao were to avoid situations that would result in such reprisals however due to the japanese callousness toward the local populations reprisals often still occurred in addition to ambushing occupying japanese forces filipino guerrillas provided valuable intelligence reports to allied strategists initially fertigs forces were able to repel japanese attempts to recapture territory held by the guerrillas the japanese could not take any major actions against usfip on mindanao as not only were they dealing with other resistance movements in the philippines but most of their combat troops had been deployed to other areas of the pacific however in late spring  the japanese began military actions on a large scale on mindanao in those areas affected usfip forces had to retreat and give up land established camps and government infrastructure to the stronger japanese forces as the guerrilla units and government infrastructure fled before the japanese forces something occurred which fertig had hoped for he called it the pillow effect by providing no resistance to a stronger force the guerrillas survived the japanese blow when the japanese withdrew the pillow expanded to its original shape as the companysized guerrilla units dissolved the japanese began breaking up their units into smaller groups—eventually into squads—to track down these smaller units then without any orders from above first two or three guerrillas then  or more then platoon and then companysized units reorganized and struck back at the smaller japanese units causing the japanese heavy casualties in hundreds of small fire fights the japanese responded by reforming into battalionsized units that needed large towns to support them eventually the japanese using  to  troops on mindanao held the large towns on the sea coast while the usfip held the rest of the countryside or approximately  of the island of mindanao the guerrillas were so effective in some areas local japanese commanders made separate truces with them in exchange for the guerrillas not attacking japanese troops the japanese agreed to stay out of those areas in august  based upon favorable reports to macarthur by parsons and smith fertig was promoted to full colonel by macarthur and received the distinguished service cross for his efforts on  august fertig received the following message in recognition of your meritorious services as district commander and extraordinary heroism in action during the period of  may  to  august  i have awarded you the distinguished service cross announcement of your award is published in go hqs usaffe dtd  august i congratulate you on the distinguished service to your country and to the filipino people that has so well earned for you such recognition and hope that in it you will find inspiration for even greater future service quezon congratulates you on promotion fertig even created a navy by arming several small merchant vessels which he used to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine these vessels also attacked japanese shipping primarily small intercoastal vessels and patrol boats the usfip navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers homemade cannons and even mortars later some used  mm cannons supplied by the us navy one vessel was even armored using large circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large japanese steamer and another a sailing ship armed with  mm cannon fought off japanese aircraft and actually shot one down perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a japanese mitsubishi medium bomber more importantly the crew salvaged a new japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent it out on the next submarine to australia one of fertigs most audacious ship captains was waldo neveling a german civilian soldier of fortune and an enemy alien fertig had commissioned into the us army another ship called the bastard was actually a foot whaleboat captained by australian robert jock mclaren an escaped prisonerofwar from the sandakan pow camp on borneo mclaren would sail his boat into japanese controlled ports in broad daylight shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar then turn tail and run to help prepare for the eventual invasion of american forces fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised one as long as  feet which took over a year to build the airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops all that was needed was a bulldozer to scrape off the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes some of these airstrips were later used by us marine corps squadrons to provide closeair support during the invasion early in  the japanese army once again launched a major effort in an attempt to destroy the guerrillas on mindanao although essentially a repeat of their previous failed efforts they came close to destroying the guerrillas not by eliminating them but by cutting off their sources of supplies this effort came to an abrupt end when the american army and navy launched their longawaited offensive against the philippines with a landing first on leyte and then on  april  on mindanao as the japanese army pulled its troops out of mindanao to defend other portions of the philippines american air and naval forces extracted a terrible toll on japanese shipping killing untold thousands of japanese troops when many of the survivors of the sinking ships swam ashore they found filipino guerrillas and civilians waiting for them on the beaches armed with bolos exhausted from the swim the japanese were unable to fight back against the terrible retribution the filipinos then extracted for the atrocities the japanese had perpetrated against them during the years of occupation the usfip also contributed heavily to coastwatching activities as requested by macarthurs headquarters fertigs coastwatchers provided information leading to the victories in the first battle of the philippine sea the great marianas turkey shoot and the battle of leyte gulf other intelligence gathered by fertigs guerrillas was so accurate aerial reconnaissance flights before attacks were often canceled so as not to warn the japanese the guerrillas often went to great risks to secure accurate information for example they would make pencilandpaper rubbings of the serial numbers on enemy artillery to prove the accuracy of their information however estimates of enemy strength in an area were sometimes unreliable as with the american forces now in the philippines the japanese were constantly moving their forces around to meet the threat lieutenant general robert eichelberger commanding the us eighth army often downplayed guerrilla intelligence but this was throughout the philippines as a whole for the th military district commanded by fertig he had this to say we did have considerable information about dispositions of enemy troop since guerrilla forces on mindanao were the most effective and best organized in the philippines but probably the best estimate of the value of guerrilla intelligence came from the japanese when they released an official communique stating that the americans had perfected a new aerial bomb which was attracted by concentrations of ammunition and fuel the bomb was simply accurate information on japanese installations supplied by the guerrillas as first american carrier planes then longdistance landbased planes began raids on the philippines the guerrillas became important for yet another reason as american pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by japanese antiaircraft fire they often found filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by filipinos in small swift boats often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships debriefing officers within a day or two fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing he knew they were more important flying missions against japanese targets besides colonel fertig now had a good supply of experienced battlehardened american and filipino leaders for his combat patrols the uss narwhal a submarine with a large cargo capacity made supply runs to the philippines from its humble beginnings usfip became one of the best equipped and most effective irregular units operating in world war ii when the submarine uss narwhal arrived at mindanao in nov  to deliver supplies the crew was met by a uniformed band playing stars and stripes forever although submarines had already delivered supplies to fertig and other guerrilla leaders the narwhals large size enabled it to deliver  tons of supplies at a time whereas other submarines could only deliver four tons or less this greatly increased the ability of the guerrilla forces not only to inflict damage to the enemy but also provide the necessary supplies to care for the medical health and wellbeing of the guerrilla forces and their civilian supporters in addition uss narwhal had the room to evacuate guerrillas needing critical medical care as well as american civilians primarily women and children who had been hiding out in the philippines and were suffering from malnutrition and diseases according to us navy records  of  resupply missions to the philippines were directed to mindanao between  january  and  january  for all of the philippines a total of  tons of supplies were landed with  people landed and another  evacuated filipino guerrillas secured airstrips for us planes on mindanao as an indicator of usfip strength on mindanao during january and february  in preparation for the return of regular american forces the guerrillas seized the dipolog airstrip in northern zamboanga and held it while surrounded by the japanese with the arrival of regular american forces in march  fertigs guerrilla forces participated in the battle of mindanao that effectively ended organized japanese resistance on that island they then disbanded on  september  the th infantry division of the philippine commonwealth army was reactivated and its ranks were heavily seeded with filipino veterans of the usfip at all levels of command american forces return to the philippines by late  fertig commanded a force estimated at between  and  effectives with most sources agreeing on —the equivalent of an army corps—with  of them armed officers with responsibility for corps command usually hold the rank of major general in addition fertig created and help administer the civilian government of mindanao while at the same time conducting the guerrilla war against the japanese the usfip killed at least  japanese soldiers and while a constant drain on japanese resources they also prevented the japanese from fully utilizing mindanaos resources in support of its war efforts at one time the japanese committed approximately  troops in an attempt to crush guerrilla resistance on mindanao troops that were desperately needed elsewhere throughout the entire philippines the guerrillas managed to tie down a japanese army of  troops of which approximately – were on mindanao depending on the time period after the war examination of japanese records indicated that the japanese high command felt that  battalions of troops would be needed to guard rear areas against guerrillas once the american invasion of the philippines began since seven divisions were slated to resist the invasion this resulted in a ratio of one reararea soldier to every three frontline troops ultimately the japanese concluded that it is impossible to fight the enemy and at the same time suppress the activities of the guerrillas while summarizing colonel wendell fertigs contributions to the american war effort and his leadership of the usfip on mindanao keats  states apart from his insistence on honesty and justice and the idea that the guerrilla army be a process of a responsible civil government his fundamental contribution to mindanao was his concern that the reward for performance should always be increased responsibility in his command demonstrated competence was the sole means to promotion and no man was denied an opportunity to prove himself this concept built a nation in north america and it built another on mindanao it was fertig more than any other man who gave the filipinos of mindanao increasing reason to believe in themselves this rather than a military victory was fertigs triumph the moro muslim datu pino sliced the ears off japanese and cashed them in with colonel fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and  centavos postwaredit some scholars question why fertig did not receive the medal of honor despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life others question why when fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men who were never in combat received that rank as the us army grew in size william manchester in his  biography of macarthur american caesar offers the opinion that macarthur and his staff may have had their own agenda in minimizing the efforts of fertig other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the philippines for example the american joint chiefs of staff authorized general macarthur to liberate the island of luzon but none of the other philippine islands after capturing luzon macarthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the joint chiefs manchester stated he macarthur wanted to become the liberator of the philippines the japanese armys practice of referring to fertig as major general fertig commander in chief in the philippines throughout the occupation period and its use of japanese military notation in referring to the th military district as the  army group did not endear fertig to macarthurs headquarters manchester also relates that lieutenant colonel courtney whitney an ultraconservative manila corporation lawyer was assigned to macarthurs staff promoted and assigned responsibility for philippine civil affairs manchester wrote from the standpoint of the guerrillas he was a disastrous choice undiplomatic and belligerent he was condescending toward all filipinos except those who like himself had substantial investments in the philippines and by the time macarthur was ready to land on leyte whitney had converted most of the staff to reactionaryism at his urging the general macarthur barred oss agents from the southwest pacific because whitney suspected they would aid leftwing guerrillas by minimizing the efforts of the guerrilla movement in freeing the philippines whitney also robbed it of political clout after the war to make any substantial liberal changes in philippine government and society after the war in may  colonel fertig was awarded the us army distinguished service medal the citation reads in part constantly engaged with vastly superior enemy forces he engendered filipino faith and confidence in their ultimate deliverance instilled in them the will to resist and united them in the cause of freedom by his outstanding courage tireless determination and brilliant leadership colonel fertig made an inestimable contribution to the liberation of the philippine islands after the war fertig spent four years as the officerincharge of rotc at the colorado school of mines a surprisingly lowlevel post after such a distinguished war time career however when the korean war began he spent two years at the pentagon with a psychological warfare unit from july  to june  he was the special forces plans officer in the office of the chief of psychological warfare with headquarters us army then from june  to august  he served as deputy chief of psychological warfare it was during this time that he helped establish the armys psychological warfare center at fort bragg north carolina which later became the john f kennedy special warfare center and school due to his wartime experiences and postwar work fertig is one of three men who used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of sf special forces and is considered one of the founding fathers of the us army special forces colonel fertig was released from active duty in the mids fertig was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao in june  wendell fertig and his wife returned to mindanao on a business trip as the interisland freighter pulled into cagayan the ships captain approached ferting and said sir i think friends await you as numerous small craft full of shouting men surrounded the ship wendell and mary fertig saw thousands of filipinos waiting at the waterfront at cagayan they had come from every corner of mindanao there were masses of women in the white uniforms of the womens auxiliary service and men wearing caps of the philippine veterans legion and the red fezzes of the moros the men were shouting and the women were singing they then saw a huge banner over the pier welcome the indomitable patriot who have lessened human suffering on mindanao wendell fertig ran a successful mining company in colorado until he died on  march  popular cultureedit a movie on wendell fertig has been in the planning stages for several years as of march  robert towne had finished the screenplay and it was presented to

businessman wendell fertig  december  –  march  was an american civil engineer in the americanadministered commonwealth of the philippines who organized and commanded an americanfilipino guerrilla force on the japaneseoccupied southern philippine island of mindanao during world war ii fertig held a us army reserve commission and was called into military service before the war in the pacific began ordered from corregidor before its surrender to the japanese he was sent to mindanao to assume command of engineer activities there almost as soon as he arrived the us army forces on mindanao surrendered but fertig refused to do so fertig used his knowledge of the filipino people to organize them into a guerrilla army and civilian government he also used his engineering knowledge to solve problems in supply and construction fertig led the guerrillas against the japanese and their collaborators mostly in hitandrun raids and vital coast watching activities after making contact with us forces in the pacific the guerrillas began to receive supplies but never enough to stage large scale attacks more than once the japanese tried to destroy fertig and his guerrilla army committing large numbers of troops for this purpose at these times fertig had his forces retreat before the japanese until they were also dispersed then counterattacked the japanese with local superiority in numbers this continued until american forces returned to the philippines after the war fertig returned to his civilian engineering career but retained his reserve commission he spent four years as commander of the rotc detachment at the colorado school of mines his alma mater and served in a usbased psychological warfare unit during the korean war leaving active duty in the mids he ran a successful colorado mining company until his death during his postwar years he was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao and was a highly respected figure among the us special forces one authority lists him among the top ten guerrilla leaders in history contents  prewar  world war ii  early war experiences  avoiding capture  organizing the resistance  fighting the japanese  postwar  popular culture  decorations  see also  citations  references  external links prewaredit wendell fertig was born in la junta colorado where he lived until he completed high school he then studied engineering at the colorado school of mines in golden colorado after graduation from college he married his wife mary in  he and his family moved to the philippines where he had a successful career as a civil engineer until the war broke out fertig was described as tall sandyhaired with an athletic build and being calm genial deliberate and possessing a remarkable memory and a great facility for remembering names his experience as an engineer  and methods of attacking problems would serve him in the challenges he would face as the leader of the mindanao guerrillas it was due primarily to his personal leadership qualities that the mindanao resistance movement was unified under one leader and became the most successful of all the guerrilla units in the philippines early in  fertig was on leave in manila from his job on samar due to his military classes in college he held a reserve commission in the united states army corps of engineers as a result he was called to duty on  june  as a captain reserve in the army engineers as the united states prepared for war in the pacific theater at that time us analysts believed that the philippines might be one of the first areas japan would attack fertigs first assignments were as assistant engineer bataan field area then as engineer north luzon area by november  he was chief of the construction section general headquarters and spent most of his time overseeing preparation and improvement of airfields throughout the philippines in late  the us began evacuating the wives and children of military families in january  according to one of fertigs daughters mary fertig and their two children patricia hudson and jeannne left on the last evacuation ship and returned to the united states however other sources have fertigs family leaving the philippines as early as the summer of  this action was taken to relieve the concerns of officers and enlisted men called to duty about the welfare of their families american civilian families men women and children were not evacuated so as not to lessen the morale of the citizens of the philippines the native people of the philippines who could not leave suffered terribly under the japanese occupation it is estimated that at least one out of every  filipinos died at the hands of the japanese during the occupation world war iiedit early war experiencesedit on  december  japanese troops invaded the philippines among fertigs duties during the retreat to bataan and corregidor was the destruction of supplies left behind by retreating american forces his attention to detail was such that he even drove his new dodge car off a pier and into manila bay promoted twice by april  fertig—by then a lieutenant colonel—was sent from bataan on luzon to mindanao by general edward p king luzon force commander to assist general william f sharp mindanao force commander in the construction of airfields in they fought alone the author states that lt colonel fertig was ordered off corregidor to join general douglas macarthurs headquarters in australia however since he was not known to members of macarthurs headquarters in australia it is probably correct that he was ordered to mindanao to assist american forces there fertig arrived on mindanao on  april  and was assigned to supervise the demolition of main roads and bridges to prevent their use by the japanese avoiding captureedit after the us forces in and around the island of luzon surrendered in may  fertig decided not to give himself up to the japanese when another fleeing officer accompanying him asked what they were going to do fertig replied any damn thing but surrender during his movement from corregidor to mindanao fertig survived or avoided a number of airplane crashes as a result he felt that he was destined for something special later after organizing the guerrilla forces on mindanao he wrote in this diary i am called on to lead a resistance movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances but i feel that i am indeed a man of destiny that my course is charted and that only success lies at the end of the trail i do not envision failure it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time in the end we will be successful colonel fertig wearing red goatee during the war upon learning of the surrender of the american forces under general wainwright fertig spent weeks crossing the mountains and jungles in an attempt to contact general sharp upon learning that sharp had surrendered his forces to the japanese on  may  fertig then spent more weeks considering his options realizing that to gain face and authority he had to wait until guerrillas contacted him fertig monitored the military and political situation in mindanao by means of the jungle telegraph fertig also grew a red goatee believing that it would make him look older and wiser among a people who believed that age brought wisdom to the filipinos fertig would become known simply as tatay father many of the emerging guerrilla forces at that time were simply bandit groups pretending to fight the japanese but really using the collapse of the americansupported government to set themselves up as rulers of local areas these groups competed with each other for territory and authority on  september  the leader of one strong group approached fertig hoping to use him as a front ie representing american military forces to assume authority over the entire island fertig consented but then used his knowledge of the filipino people and the current situation in mindanao to eventually take over the command of that group and then others recognizing that he needed a higher rank so he would be taken seriously by potential recruits to his struggle including the leaders of other existing guerrilla bands fertig promoted himself to brigadier general this selfpromotion to brigadier general did not endear him to general macarthur or his staff but macarthur did send logistical support to fertig throughout  and  organizing the resistanceedit japanese bombings destruction by retreating american troops deprivations by bandit guerrilla bands and hoarding by civilians had significantly reduced available war supplies as well as those items necessary to run an effective government fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped americans and resisting filipinos to create many supplies from scratch for example tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for  caliber rifles steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles money was printed in both english and the local language using wooden blocks and fisherman towed japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel often seemingly impossible problems were overcome simply through perseverance for example gerardo almendres a filipino high school student had sent away for an international correspondence schools course on radios shortly before the war started fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though almendres had never handled one almendres was assisted by a filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another filipino who once had listened to a radio radio parts vacuum tubes and other electrical parts were scrounged from old radio receivers and sound equipment from an old movie projector and other electrical devices their makeshift radio eventually worked and they began to receive transmissions from other radios including those of roy bell on negros who traveled to fertigs camp and devised a new aerial however they had no way of knowing if their own transmissions were successful until on  january  the us navy radio monitoring station in san francisco answered their call sign robert c ball william f konko and stewart willever jr became fertigs signal corps– this was an extremely important accomplishment as american military commands in the pacific had no idea that there was any effective armed resistance on mindanao or even in the philippines general charles willoughby macarthurs intelligence chief had assured him that there was no possibility of such the american command in the pacific first heard of fertig when the japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed major general fertig but the americans simply dismissed it as propaganda it took weeks before american intelligence was able to confirm who fertig was and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the japanese part of this investigative process involved mary fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husbands life mrs fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last american plane leaving mindanao a phrase in the letter pineapples for breakfast let mrs fertig know that her husband was alive and well on mindanao as that is where they spent short vacations and while there he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast the latest american intelligence had placed fertig on corregidor at the time of the surrender and so the us army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the japanese in february  with tenuous communication established general macarthur appointed fertig as commanding officer of the th military district on mindanao during the initial exchange of messages macarthur disallowed any promotion of american armed forces personnel in the philippines to general rank as a result fertig reduced himself in rank to colonel but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a filipino metalsmith due to the difficulty in communicating with fertig and his command because of the makeshift radio almendres had built a submarine loaded with military and medical supplies was eventually sent to mindanao arriving on  march  it also carried two americans who had known fertig in the philippines one was charles smith who on  december  had escaped with two other americans and two filipinos by sailing a small boat to australia perhaps at that time the longest openboat voyage since captain blighs smith was now a captain in us army intelligence the other was charles parsons formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in us navy intelligence in addition to his other prewar business interests in manila parsons had represented panama as its resident counsel when the japanese occupied manila parsons was careful to speak only spanish and convinced the japanese he was a citizen of panama as a result the japanese eventually sent parsons and his family on a long journey back to panama but when the swedish ship carrying them docked in new york and before he could report to us intelligence fbi agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked parsons who he was and quickly hustled him and his family ashore however another source states that parsons reported to us intelligence in the canal zone after the ship docked in panama it was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the german italian or other legations who knew parsons true citizenship status exposed his masquerade to the japanese their role as smith and parsons immediately explained to fertig was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and if so was it worth the risk of men and supplies to support him at the same time parsons and smith brought fertig some unpleasant orders from macarthurs headquarters the american army was willing to provide radios and other equipment for fertigs command but these were only to be used for passing information on japanese activities from coastwatchers and other sources to australia the guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the japanese fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support however due to the numerous atrocities that the japanese were committing against the philippine population the only way that fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning so as to provide the filipinos an outlet for revenge against the japanese fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the japanese then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with macarthurs headquarters and its directives in addition general charles a willoughby macarthurs chief of intelligence was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources if a regular us army had been defeated by the japanese in the philippines then no irregular force could do better the guerrillas only purpose was to provide intelligence and later if fully equipped prior to the return of american forces to the philippines to fight as regular forces under the command of american officers fertig needed experienced american soldiers to train the filipino guerrillas the almost total lack of supplies was a serious problem but it was not the most pressing problem fertig faced at the time of the japanese invasion most philippine army units were of low quality they were not only poorly trained enough time not having passed to do so but they were underequipped and did not have the firepower to resist better armed japanese troops tanks and planes most of the soldiers were barefoot and many of their world war i era weapons lacked replacement parts and did not operate properly as a result many filipino units fled when attacked by the japanese this was symptomatic of fertigs most pressing need—experienced leaders he knew that eventually numerous leaders would emerge from the filipinos some guerrilla bands already had strong leaders but he needed them now his best resource for this leadership cadre was american servicemen who had either not surrendered or had escaped from prisonerofwar camps many were already fighting as guerrilla leaders or eager to so others joined him after he explained the need for their services but many others were not willing and demanded they be sent to australia where they could rejoin regular units fertigs reaction was not always one of understanding he told many that they would be returned when a means was found but that they would never be allowed to return others he removed from duty when it was apparent they did not have the leadership skills required eventually they were also returned to australia by submarine many with negative reports on their behavior some regular army personnel resented being commanded by a civilian turned soldier even if he had been in the philippines more years than they had many of the younger americans had disobeyed the orders to surrender due to their individualism others had used their cunning to evade the japanese or escape from the pow camps these traits sometimes led to clashes with the older men who had lived in the philippines for years and were now in command positions due to their reserve commissions or promotion by fertig as a result those who departed did not always report favorably on fertig once they reached macarthurs headquarters in australia those who stayed and fought received immediate commissions or were promoted if they already were officers in the us army although they might be sailors marines or even civilians macarthur eventually approved all of fertigs promotions even though advised not to do so by lt colonel courtney whitney his staff officer for filipino civilian affairs fighting the japaneseedit colonel fertig slowly assumed control over more of the existing rival guerrilla units on mindanao and turned them to harassing the japanese over the next two and a half years fertig created and commanded the mindanao segment of the united states forces in the philippines usfip recruiting escaped prisonersofwar and soldiers and american civilians who had refused to surrender however his real strength came from the thousands of patriotic filipinos many of whom were enraged by japanese atrocities who now joined existing or formed new organizations under his command the japanese were not unaware of these activities especially as they began to suffer losses in men and equipment and lose control of large areas between  and  usfip conducted numerous raids against the japanese occupation forces on mindanao in order to both sustain fertigs operation with captured supplies and to carry on harassing operations against the japanese this caused discord between fertig and macarthurs headquarters the american south west pacific area command wanted fertig to man coastwatcher units to report on japanese movements especially shipping as its main effort however to retain the loyalty of his forces in the wake of japanese atrocities fertig also had to wage an active campaign to kill japanese and their collaborators as well as disrupt activities aimed at civilians attacks against the japanese often initiated terrible reprisals by the japanese against local civilians so fertig issued orders that the guerrillas on mindanao were to avoid situations that would result in such reprisals however due to the japanese callousness toward the local populations reprisals often still occurred in addition to ambushing occupying japanese forces filipino guerrillas provided valuable intelligence reports to allied strategists initially fertigs forces were able to repel japanese attempts to recapture territory held by the guerrillas the japanese could not take any major actions against usfip on mindanao as not only were they dealing with other resistance movements in the philippines but most of their combat troops had been deployed to other areas of the pacific however in late spring  the japanese began military actions on a large scale on mindanao in those areas affected usfip forces had to retreat and give up land established camps and government infrastructure to the stronger japanese forces as the guerrilla units and government infrastructure fled before the japanese forces something occurred which fertig had hoped for he called it the pillow effect by providing no resistance to a stronger force the guerrillas survived the japanese blow when the japanese withdrew the pillow expanded to its original shape as the companysized guerrilla units dissolved the japanese began breaking up their units into smaller groups—eventually into squads—to track down these smaller units then without any orders from above first two or three guerrillas then  or more then platoon and then companysized units reorganized and struck back at the smaller japanese units causing the japanese heavy casualties in hundreds of small fire fights the japanese responded by reforming into battalionsized units that needed large towns to support them eventually the japanese using  to  troops on mindanao held the large towns on the sea coast while the usfip held the rest of the countryside or approximately  of the island of mindanao the guerrillas were so effective in some areas local japanese commanders made separate truces with them in exchange for the guerrillas not attacking japanese troops the japanese agreed to stay out of those areas in august  based upon favorable reports to macarthur by parsons and smith fertig was promoted to full colonel by macarthur and received the distinguished service cross for his efforts on  august fertig received the following message in recognition of your meritorious services as district commander and extraordinary heroism in action during the period of  may  to  august  i have awarded you the distinguished service cross announcement of your award is published in go hqs usaffe dtd  august i congratulate you on the distinguished service to your country and to the filipino people that has so well earned for you such recognition and hope that in it you will find inspiration for even greater future service quezon congratulates you on promotion fertig even created a navy by arming several small merchant vessels which he used to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine these vessels also attacked japanese shipping primarily small intercoastal vessels and patrol boats the usfip navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers homemade cannons and even mortars later some used  mm cannons supplied by the us navy one vessel was even armored using large circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large japanese steamer and another a sailing ship armed with  mm cannon fought off japanese aircraft and actually shot one down perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a japanese mitsubishi medium bomber more importantly the crew salvaged a new japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent it out on the next submarine to australia one of fertigs most audacious ship captains was waldo neveling a german civilian soldier of fortune and an enemy alien fertig had commissioned into the us army another ship called the bastard was actually a foot whaleboat captained by australian robert jock mclaren an escaped prisonerofwar from the sandakan pow camp on borneo mclaren would sail his boat into japanese controlled ports in broad daylight shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar then turn tail and run to help prepare for the eventual invasion of american forces fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised one as long as  feet which took over a year to build the airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops all that was needed was a bulldozer to scrape off the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes some of these airstrips were later used by us marine corps squadrons to provide closeair support during the invasion early in  the japanese army once again launched a major effort in an attempt to destroy the guerrillas on mindanao although essentially a repeat of their previous failed efforts they came close to destroying the guerrillas not by eliminating them but by cutting off their sources of supplies this effort came to an abrupt end when the american army and navy launched their longawaited offensive against the philippines with a landing first on leyte and then on  april  on mindanao as the japanese army pulled its troops out of mindanao to defend other portions of the philippines american air and naval forces extracted a terrible toll on japanese shipping killing untold thousands of japanese troops when many of the survivors of the sinking ships swam ashore they found filipino guerrillas and civilians waiting for them on the beaches armed with bolos exhausted from the swim the japanese were unable to fight back against the terrible retribution the filipinos then extracted for the atrocities the japanese had perpetrated against them during the years of occupation the usfip also contributed heavily to coastwatching activities as requested by macarthurs headquarters fertigs coastwatchers provided information leading to the victories in the first battle of the philippine sea the great marianas turkey shoot and the battle of leyte gulf other intelligence gathered by fertigs guerrillas was so accurate aerial reconnaissance flights before attacks were often canceled so as not to warn the japanese the guerrillas often went to great risks to secure accurate information for example they would make pencilandpaper rubbings of the serial numbers on enemy artillery to prove the accuracy of their information however estimates of enemy strength in an area were sometimes unreliable as with the american forces now in the philippines the japanese were constantly moving their forces around to meet the threat lieutenant general robert eichelberger commanding the us eighth army often downplayed guerrilla intelligence but this was throughout the philippines as a whole for the th military district commanded by fertig he had this to say we did have considerable information about dispositions of enemy troop since guerrilla forces on mindanao were the most effective and best organized in the philippines but probably the best estimate of the value of guerrilla intelligence came from the japanese when they released an official communique stating that the americans had perfected a new aerial bomb which was attracted by concentrations of ammunition and fuel the bomb was simply accurate information on japanese installations supplied by the guerrillas as first american carrier planes then longdistance landbased planes began raids on the philippines the guerrillas became important for yet another reason as american pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by japanese antiaircraft fire they often found filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by filipinos in small swift boats often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships debriefing officers within a day or two fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing he knew they were more important flying missions against japanese targets besides colonel fertig now had a good supply of experienced battlehardened american and filipino leaders for his combat patrols the uss narwhal a submarine with a large cargo capacity made supply runs to the philippines from its humble beginnings usfip became one of the best equipped and most effective irregular units operating in world war ii when the submarine uss narwhal arrived at mindanao in nov  to deliver supplies the crew was met by a uniformed band playing stars and stripes forever although submarines had already delivered supplies to fertig and other guerrilla leaders the narwhals large size enabled it to deliver  tons of supplies at a time whereas other submarines could only deliver four tons or less this greatly increased the ability of the guerrilla forces not only to inflict damage to the enemy but also provide the necessary supplies to care for the medical health and wellbeing of the guerrilla forces and their civilian supporters in addition uss narwhal had the room to evacuate guerrillas needing critical medical care as well as american civilians primarily women and children who had been hiding out in the philippines and were suffering from malnutrition and diseases according to us navy records  of  resupply missions to the philippines were directed to mindanao between  january  and  january  for all of the philippines a total of  tons of supplies were landed with  people landed and another  evacuated filipino guerrillas secured airstrips for us planes on mindanao as an indicator of usfip strength on mindanao during january and february  in preparation for the return of regular american forces the guerrillas seized the dipolog airstrip in northern zamboanga and held it while surrounded by the japanese with the arrival of regular american forces in march  fertigs guerrilla forces participated in the battle of mindanao that effectively ended organized japanese resistance on that island they then disbanded on  september  the th infantry division of the philippine commonwealth army was reactivated and its ranks were heavily seeded with filipino veterans of the usfip at all levels of command american forces return to the philippines by late  fertig commanded a force estimated at between  and  effectives with most sources agreeing on —the equivalent of an army corps—with  of them armed officers with responsibility for corps command usually hold the rank of major general in addition fertig created and help administer the civilian government of mindanao while at the same time conducting the guerrilla war against the japanese the usfip killed at least  japanese soldiers and while a constant drain on japanese resources they also prevented the japanese from fully utilizing mindanaos resources in support of its war efforts at one time the japanese committed approximately  troops in an attempt to crush guerrilla resistance on mindanao troops that were desperately needed elsewhere throughout the entire philippines the guerrillas managed to tie down a japanese army of  troops of which approximately – were on mindanao depending on the time period after the war examination of japanese records indicated that the japanese high command felt that  battalions of troops would be needed to guard rear areas against guerrillas once the american invasion of the philippines began since seven divisions were slated to resist the invasion this resulted in a ratio of one reararea soldier to every three frontline troops ultimately the japanese concluded that it is impossible to fight the enemy and at the same time suppress the activities of the guerrillas while summarizing colonel wendell fertigs contributions to the american war effort and his leadership of the usfip on mindanao keats  states apart from his insistence on honesty and justice and the idea that the guerrilla army be a process of a responsible civil government his fundamental contribution to mindanao was his concern that the reward for performance should always be increased responsibility in his command demonstrated competence was the sole means to promotion and no man was denied an opportunity to prove himself this concept built a nation in north america and it built another on mindanao it was fertig more than any other man who gave the filipinos of mindanao increasing reason to believe in themselves this rather than a military victory was fertigs triumph the moro muslim datu pino sliced the ears off japanese and cashed them in with colonel fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and  centavos postwaredit some scholars question why fertig did not receive the medal of honor despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life others question why when fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men who were never in combat received that rank as the us army grew in size william manchester in his  biography of macarthur american caesar offers the opinion that macarthur and his staff may have had their own agenda in minimizing the efforts of fertig other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the philippines for example the american joint chiefs of staff authorized general macarthur to liberate the island of luzon but none of the other philippine islands after capturing luzon macarthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the joint chiefs manchester stated he macarthur wanted to become the liberator of the philippines the japanese armys practice of referring to fertig as major general fertig commander in chief in the philippines throughout the occupation period and its use of japanese military notation in referring to the th military district as the  army group did not endear fertig to macarthurs headquarters manchester also relates that lieutenant colonel courtney whitney an ultraconservative manila corporation lawyer was assigned to macarthurs staff promoted and assigned responsibility for philippine civil affairs manchester wrote from the standpoint of the guerrillas he was a disastrous choice undiplomatic and belligerent he was condescending toward all filipinos except those who like himself had substantial investments in the philippines and by the time macarthur was ready to land on leyte whitney had converted most of the staff to reactionaryism at his urging the general macarthur barred oss agents from the southwest pacific because whitney suspected they would aid leftwing guerrillas by minimizing the efforts of the guerrilla movement in freeing the philippines whitney also robbed it of political clout after the war to make any substantial liberal changes in philippine government and society after the war in may  colonel fertig was awarded the us army distinguished service medal the citation reads in part constantly engaged with vastly superior enemy forces he engendered filipino faith and confidence in their ultimate deliverance instilled in them the will to resist and united them in the cause of freedom by his outstanding courage tireless determination and brilliant leadership colonel fertig made an inestimable contribution to the liberation of the philippine islands after the war fertig spent four years as the officerincharge of rotc at the colorado school of mines a surprisingly lowlevel post after such a distinguished war time career however when the korean war began he spent two years at the pentagon with a psychological warfare unit from july  to june  he was the special forces plans officer in the office of the chief of psychological warfare with headquarters us army then from june  to august  he served as deputy chief of psychological warfare it was during this time that he helped establish the armys psychological warfare center at fort bragg north carolina which later became the john f kennedy special warfare center and school due to his wartime experiences and postwar work fertig is one of three men who used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of sf special forces and is considered one of the founding fathers of the us army special forces colonel fertig was released from active duty in the mids fertig was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao in june  wendell fertig and his wife returned to mindanao on a business trip as the interisland freighter pulled into cagayan the ships captain approached ferting and said sir i think friends await you as numerous small craft full of shouting men surrounded the ship wendell and mary fertig saw thousands of filipinos waiting at the waterfront at cagayan they had come from every corner of mindanao there were masses of women in the white uniforms of the womens auxiliary service and men wearing caps of the philippine veterans legion and the red fezzes of the moros the men were shouting and the women were singing they then saw a huge banner over the pier welcome the indomitable patriot who have lessened human suffering on mindanao wendell fertig ran a successful mining company in colorado until he died on  march  popular cultureedit a movie on wendell fertig has been in the planning stages for several years as of march  robert towne had finished the screenplay and it was presented to sony productions for final approval david fincher the director is eager to start production several movie web sites

and was called into military service before the war in the pacific began ordered from corregidor before its surrender to the japanese he was sent to mindanao to assume command of engineer activities there almost as soon as he arrived the us army forces on mindanao surrendered but fertig refused to do so fertig used his knowledge of the filipino people to organize them into a guerrilla army and civilian government he also used his engineering knowledge to solve problems in supply and construction fertig led the guerrillas against the japanese and their collaborators mostly in hitandrun raids and vital coast watching activities after making contact with us forces in the pacific the guerrillas began to receive supplies but never enough to stage large scale attacks more than once the japanese tried to destroy fertig and his guerrilla army committing large numbers of troops for this purpose at these times fertig had his forces retreat before the japanese until they were also dispersed then counterattacked the japanese with local superiority in numbers this continued until american forces returned to the philippines after the war fertig returned to his civilian engineering

deliberate and possessing a remarkable memory and a great facility for remembering names his experience as an engineer  and methods of attacking problems would serve him in the challenges he would face as the leader of the mindanao guerrillas it was due primarily to his personal leadership qualities that the mindanao resistance movement was unified under one leader and became the most successful of all the guerrilla units in the philippines early in  fertig was on leave in manila from his job on samar due to his military classes in college he held a reserve commission in the united states army corps of engineers as a result he was called to duty on  june  as a captain reserve in the army engineers as the united states prepared for war in the pacific theater at that time us analysts believed that the philippines might be one of the first areas japan would attack fertigs first assignments were as assistant engineer bataan field area then as engineer north luzon area by november  he was chief of the construction section general headquarters and spent most of his time overseeing preparation and improvement of airfields throughout the philippines in late  the us began evacuating the wives and children of military families in january  according to one of fertigs daughters mary fertig and their two children patricia hudson and jeannne left on the last evacuation ship and returned to the united states however other sources have fertigs family leaving the philippines as early as the summer of  this action was taken to relieve the concerns of officers and enlisted men called to duty about the welfare of their families american civilian families men women and children were not evacuated so as not to lessen the morale of the citizens of the philippines the native people of the philippines who could not leave suffered terribly under the japanese occupation it is estimated that at least one out of every  filipinos died at the hands of the japanese during the occupation world war iiedit early war experiencesedit on  december  japanese troops invaded the philippines among fertigs duties during the retreat to bataan and corregidor was the destruction of supplies left behind by retreating american forces his attention to detail was such that he even drove his new dodge car off a pier and into manila bay promoted twice by april  fertig—by then a lieutenant colonel—was sent from bataan on luzon to mindanao by general edward p king luzon force commander to assist general william f sharp mindanao force commander in the construction of airfields in they fought alone the author states that lt colonel fertig was ordered off corregidor to join general douglas macarthurs headquarters in australia however since he was not known to members of macarthurs headquarters in australia it is probably correct that he was ordered to mindanao to assist american forces there fertig arrived on mindanao on  april  and was assigned to supervise the demolition of main roads and bridges to prevent their use by the japanese avoiding captureedit after the us forces in and around the island of luzon surrendered in may  fertig decided not to give himself up to the japanese when another fleeing officer accompanying him asked what they were going to do fertig replied any damn thing but surrender during his movement from corregidor to mindanao fertig survived or avoided a number of airplane crashes as a result he felt that he was destined for something special later after organizing the guerrilla forces on mindanao he wrote in this diary i am called on to lead a resistance movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances but i feel that i am indeed a man of destiny that my course is charted and that only success lies at the end of the trail i do not envision failure it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time in the end we will be successful colonel fertig wearing red goatee during the war upon learning of the surrender of the american forces under general wainwright fertig spent weeks crossing the mountains and jungles in an attempt to contact general sharp upon learning that sharp had surrendered his forces to the japanese on  may  fertig then spent more weeks considering his options realizing that to gain face and authority he had to wait until guerrillas contacted him fertig monitored the military and political situation in mindanao by means of the jungle telegraph fertig also grew a red goatee believing that it would make him look older and wiser among a people who believed that age brought wisdom to the filipinos fertig would become known simply as tatay father many of the emerging guerrilla forces at that time were simply bandit groups pretending to fight the japanese but really using the collapse of the americansupported government to set themselves up as rulers of local areas these groups competed with each other for territory and authority on  september  the leader of one strong group approached fertig hoping to use him as a front ie representing american military forces to assume authority over the entire island fertig consented but then used his knowledge of the filipino people and the current situation in mindanao to eventually take over the command of that group and then others recognizing that he needed a higher rank so he would be taken seriously by potential recruits to his struggle including the leaders of other existing guerrilla bands fertig promoted himself to brigadier general this selfpromotion to brigadier general did not endear him to general macarthur or his staff but macarthur did send logistical support to fertig throughout  and  organizing the resistanceedit japanese bombings destruction by retreating american troops deprivations by bandit guerrilla bands and hoarding by civilians had significantly reduced available war supplies as well as those items necessary to run an effective government fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped americans and resisting filipinos to create many supplies from scratch for example tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for  caliber rifles steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles money was printed in both english and the local language using wooden blocks and fisherman towed japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel often seemingly impossible problems were overcome simply through perseverance for example gerardo almendres a filipino high school student had sent away for an international correspondence schools course on radios shortly before the war started fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though almendres had never handled one almendres was assisted by a filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another filipino who once had listened to a radio radio parts vacuum tubes and other electrical parts were scrounged from old radio receivers and sound equipment from an old movie projector and other electrical devices their makeshift radio eventually worked and they began to receive transmissions from other radios including those of roy bell on negros who traveled to fertigs camp and devised a new aerial however they had no way of knowing if their own transmissions were successful until on  january  the us navy radio monitoring station in san francisco answered their call sign robert c ball william f konko and stewart willever jr became fertigs signal corps– this was an extremely important accomplishment as american military commands in the pacific had no idea that there was any effective armed resistance on mindanao or even in the philippines general charles willoughby macarthurs intelligence chief had assured him that there was no possibility of such the american command in the pacific first heard of fertig when the japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed major general fertig but the americans simply dismissed it as propaganda it took weeks before american intelligence was able to confirm who fertig was and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the japanese part of this investigative process involved mary fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husbands life mrs fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last american plane leaving mindanao a phrase in the letter pineapples for breakfast let mrs fertig know that her husband was alive and well on mindanao as that is where they spent short vacations and while there he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast the latest american intelligence had placed fertig on corregidor at the time of the surrender and so the us army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the japanese in february  with tenuous communication established general macarthur appointed fertig as commanding officer of the th military district on mindanao during the initial exchange of messages macarthur disallowed any promotion of american armed forces personnel in the philippines to general rank as a result fertig reduced himself in rank to colonel but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a filipino metalsmith due to the difficulty in communicating with fertig and his command because of the makeshift radio almendres had built a submarine loaded with military and medical supplies was eventually sent to mindanao arriving on  march  it also carried two americans who had known fertig in the philippines one was charles smith who on  december  had escaped with two other americans and two filipinos by sailing a small boat to australia perhaps at that time the longest openboat voyage since captain blighs smith was now a captain in us army intelligence the other was charles parsons formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in us navy intelligence in addition to his other prewar business interests in manila parsons had represented panama as its resident counsel when the japanese occupied manila parsons was careful to speak only spanish and convinced the japanese he was a citizen of panama as a result the japanese eventually sent parsons and his family on a long journey back to panama but when the swedish ship carrying them docked in new york and before he could report to us intelligence fbi agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked parsons who he was and quickly hustled him and his family ashore however another source states that parsons reported to us intelligence in the canal zone after the ship docked in panama it was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the german italian or other legations who knew parsons true citizenship status exposed his masquerade to the japanese their role as smith and parsons immediately explained to fertig was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and if so was it worth the risk of men and supplies to support him at the same time parsons and smith brought fertig some unpleasant orders from macarthurs headquarters the american army was willing to provide radios and other equipment for fertigs command but these were only to be used for passing information on japanese activities from coastwatchers and other sources to australia the guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the japanese fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support however due to the numerous atrocities that the japanese were committing against the philippine population the only way that fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning so as to provide the filipinos an outlet for revenge against the japanese fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the japanese then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with macarthurs headquarters and its directives in addition general charles a willoughby macarthurs chief of intelligence was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources if a regular us army had been defeated by the japanese in the philippines then no irregular force could do better the guerrillas only purpose was to provide intelligence and later if fully equipped prior to the return of american forces to the philippines to fight as regular forces under the command of american officers fertig needed experienced american soldiers to train the filipino guerrillas the almost total lack of supplies was a serious problem but it was not the most pressing problem fertig faced at the time of the japanese invasion most philippine army units were of low quality they were not only poorly trained enough time not having passed to do so but they were underequipped and did not have the firepower to resist better armed japanese troops tanks and planes most of the soldiers were barefoot and many of their world war i era weapons lacked replacement parts and did not operate properly as a result many filipino units fled when attacked by the japanese this was symptomatic of fertigs most pressing need—experienced leaders he knew that eventually numerous leaders would emerge from the filipinos some guerrilla bands already had strong leaders but he needed them now his best resource for this leadership cadre was american servicemen who had either not surrendered or had escaped from prisonerofwar camps many were already fighting as guerrilla leaders or eager to so others joined him after he explained the need for their services but many others were not willing and demanded they be sent to australia where they could rejoin regular units fertigs reaction was not always one of understanding he told many that they would be returned when a means was found but that they would never be allowed to return others he removed from duty when it was apparent they did not have the leadership skills required eventually they were also returned to australia by submarine many with negative reports on their behavior some regular army personnel resented being commanded by a civilian turned soldier even if he had been in the philippines more years than they had many of the younger americans had disobeyed the orders to surrender due to their individualism others had used their cunning to evade the japanese or escape from the pow camps these traits sometimes led to clashes with the older men who had lived in the philippines for years and were now in command positions due to their reserve commissions or promotion by fertig as a result those who departed did not always report favorably on fertig once they reached macarthurs headquarters in australia those who stayed and fought received immediate commissions or were promoted if they already were officers in the us army although they might be sailors marines or even civilians macarthur eventually approved all of fertigs promotions even though advised not to do so by lt colonel courtney whitney his staff officer for filipino civilian affairs fighting the japaneseedit colonel fertig slowly assumed control over more of the existing rival guerrilla units on mindanao and turned them to harassing the japanese over the next two and a half years fertig created and commanded the mindanao segment of the united states forces in the philippines usfip recruiting escaped prisonersofwar and soldiers and american civilians who had refused to surrender however his real strength came from the thousands of patriotic filipinos many of whom were enraged by japanese atrocities who now joined existing or formed new organizations under his command the japanese were not unaware of these activities especially as they began to suffer losses in men and equipment and lose control of large areas between  and  usfip conducted numerous raids against the japanese occupation forces on mindanao in order to both sustain fertigs operation with captured supplies and to carry on harassing operations against the japanese this caused discord between fertig and macarthurs headquarters the american south west pacific area command wanted fertig to man coastwatcher units to report on japanese movements especially shipping as its main effort however to retain the loyalty of his forces in the wake of japanese atrocities fertig also had to wage an active campaign to kill japanese and their collaborators as well as disrupt activities aimed at civilians attacks against the japanese often initiated terrible reprisals by the japanese against local civilians so fertig issued orders that the guerrillas on mindanao were to avoid situations that would result in such reprisals however due to the japanese callousness toward the local populations reprisals often still occurred in addition to ambushing occupying japanese forces filipino guerrillas provided valuable intelligence reports to allied strategists initially fertigs forces were able to repel japanese attempts to recapture territory held by the guerrillas the japanese could not take any major actions against usfip on mindanao as not only were they dealing with other resistance movements in the philippines but most of their combat troops had been deployed to other areas of the pacific however in late spring  the japanese began military actions on a large scale on mindanao in those areas affected usfip forces had to retreat and give up land established camps and government infrastructure to the stronger japanese forces as the guerrilla units and government infrastructure fled before the japanese forces something occurred which fertig had hoped for he called it the pillow effect by providing no resistance to a stronger force the guerrillas survived the japanese blow when the japanese withdrew the pillow expanded to its original shape as the companysized guerrilla units dissolved the japanese began breaking up their units into smaller groups—eventually into squads—to track down these smaller units then without any orders from above first two or three guerrillas then  or more then platoon and then companysized units reorganized and struck back at the smaller japanese units causing the japanese heavy casualties in hundreds of small fire fights the japanese responded by reforming into battalionsized units that needed large towns to support them eventually the japanese using  to  troops on mindanao held the large towns on the sea coast while the usfip held the rest of the countryside or approximately  of the island of mindanao the guerrillas were so effective in some areas local japanese commanders made separate truces with them in exchange for the guerrillas not attacking japanese troops the japanese agreed to stay out of those areas in august  based upon favorable reports to macarthur by parsons and smith fertig was promoted to full colonel by macarthur and received the distinguished service cross for his efforts on  august fertig received the following message in recognition of your meritorious services as district commander and extraordinary heroism in action during the period of  may  to  august  i have awarded you the distinguished service cross announcement of your award is published in go hqs usaffe dtd  august i congratulate you on the distinguished service to your country and to the filipino people that has so well earned for you such recognition and hope that in it you will find inspiration for even greater future service quezon congratulates you on promotion fertig even created a navy by arming several small merchant vessels which he used to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine these vessels also attacked japanese shipping primarily small intercoastal vessels and patrol boats the usfip navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers homemade cannons and even mortars later some used  mm cannons supplied by the us navy one vessel was even armored using large circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large japanese steamer and another a sailing ship armed with  mm cannon fought off japanese aircraft and actually shot one down perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a japanese mitsubishi medium bomber more importantly the crew salvaged a new japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent it out on the next submarine to australia one of fertigs most audacious ship captains was waldo neveling a german civilian soldier of fortune and an enemy alien fertig had commissioned into the us army another ship called the bastard was actually a foot whaleboat captained by australian robert jock mclaren an escaped prisonerofwar from the sandakan pow camp on borneo mclaren would sail his boat into japanese controlled ports in broad daylight shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar then turn tail and run to help prepare for the eventual invasion of american forces fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised one as long as  feet which took over a year to build the airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops all that was needed was a bulldozer to scrape off the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes some of these airstrips were later used by us marine corps squadrons to provide closeair support during the invasion early in  the japanese army once again launched a major effort in an attempt to destroy the guerrillas on mindanao although essentially a repeat of their previous failed efforts they came close to destroying the guerrillas not by eliminating them but by cutting off their sources of supplies this effort came to an abrupt end when the american army and navy launched their longawaited offensive against the philippines with a landing first on leyte and then on  april  on mindanao as the japanese army pulled its troops out of mindanao to defend other portions of the philippines american air and naval forces extracted a terrible toll on japanese shipping killing untold thousands of japanese troops when many of the survivors of the sinking ships swam ashore they found filipino guerrillas and civilians waiting for them on the beaches armed with bolos exhausted from the swim the japanese were unable to fight back against the terrible retribution the filipinos then extracted for the atrocities the japanese had perpetrated against them during the years of occupation the usfip also contributed heavily to coastwatching activities as requested by macarthurs headquarters fertigs coastwatchers provided information leading to the victories in the first battle of the philippine sea the great marianas turkey shoot and the battle of leyte gulf other intelligence gathered by fertigs guerrillas was so accurate aerial reconnaissance flights before attacks were often canceled so as not to warn the japanese the guerrillas often went to great risks to secure accurate information for example they would make pencilandpaper rubbings of the serial numbers on enemy artillery to prove the accuracy of their information however estimates of enemy strength in an area were sometimes unreliable as with the american forces now in the philippines the japanese were constantly moving their forces around to meet the threat lieutenant general robert eichelberger commanding the us eighth army often downplayed guerrilla intelligence but this was throughout the philippines as a whole for the th military district commanded by fertig he had this to say we did have considerable information about dispositions of enemy troop since guerrilla forces on mindanao were the most effective and best organized in the philippines but probably the best estimate of the value of guerrilla intelligence came from the japanese when they released an official communique stating that the americans had perfected a new aerial bomb which was attracted by concentrations of ammunition and fuel the bomb was simply accurate information on japanese installations supplied by the guerrillas as first american carrier planes then longdistance landbased planes began raids on the philippines the guerrillas became important for yet another reason as american pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by japanese antiaircraft fire they often found filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by filipinos in small swift boats often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships debriefing officers within a day or two fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing he knew they were more important flying missions against japanese targets besides colonel fertig now had a good supply of experienced battlehardened american and filipino leaders for his combat patrols the uss narwhal a submarine with a large cargo capacity made supply runs to the philippines from its humble beginnings usfip became one of the best equipped and most effective irregular units operating in world war ii when the submarine uss narwhal arrived at mindanao in nov  to deliver supplies the crew was met by a uniformed band playing stars and stripes forever although submarines had already delivered supplies to fertig and other guerrilla leaders the narwhals large size enabled it to deliver  tons of supplies at a time whereas other submarines could only deliver four tons or less this greatly increased the ability of the guerrilla forces not only to inflict damage to the enemy but also provide the necessary supplies to care for the medical health and wellbeing of the guerrilla forces and their civilian supporters in addition uss narwhal had the room to evacuate guerrillas needing critical medical care as well as american civilians primarily women and children who had been hiding out in the philippines and were suffering from malnutrition and diseases according to us navy records  of  resupply missions to the philippines were directed to mindanao between  january  and  january  for all of the philippines a total of  tons of supplies were landed with  people landed and another  evacuated filipino guerrillas secured airstrips for us planes on mindanao as an indicator of usfip strength on mindanao during january and february  in preparation for the return of regular american forces the guerrillas seized the dipolog airstrip in northern zamboanga and held it while surrounded by the japanese with the arrival of regular american forces in march  fertigs guerrilla forces participated in the battle of mindanao that effectively ended organized japanese resistance on that island they then disbanded on  september  the th infantry division of the philippine commonwealth army was reactivated and its ranks were heavily seeded with filipino veterans of the usfip at all levels of command american forces return to the philippines by late  fertig commanded a force estimated at between  and  effectives with most sources agreeing on —the equivalent of an army corps—with  of them armed officers with responsibility for corps command usually hold the rank of major general in addition fertig created and help administer the civilian government of mindanao while at the same time conducting the guerrilla war against the japanese the usfip killed at least  japanese soldiers and while a constant drain on japanese resources they also prevented the japanese from fully utilizing mindanaos resources in support of its war efforts at one time the japanese committed approximately  troops in an attempt to crush guerrilla resistance on mindanao troops that were desperately needed elsewhere throughout the entire philippines the guerrillas managed to tie down a japanese army of  troops of which approximately – were on mindanao depending on the time period after the war examination of japanese records indicated that the japanese high command felt that  battalions of troops would be needed to guard rear areas against guerrillas once the american invasion of the philippines began since seven divisions were slated to resist the invasion this resulted in a ratio of one reararea soldier to every three frontline troops ultimately the japanese concluded that it is impossible to fight the enemy and at the same time suppress the activities of the guerrillas while summarizing colonel wendell fertigs contributions to the american war effort and his leadership of the usfip on mindanao keats  states apart from his insistence on honesty and justice and the idea that the guerrilla army be a process of a responsible civil government his fundamental contribution to mindanao was his concern that the reward for performance should always be increased responsibility in his command demonstrated competence was the sole means to promotion and no man was denied an opportunity to prove himself this concept built a nation in north america and it built another on mindanao it was fertig more than any other man who gave the filipinos of mindanao increasing reason to believe in themselves this rather than a military victory was fertigs triumph the moro muslim datu pino sliced the ears off japanese and cashed them in with colonel fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and  centavos postwaredit some scholars question why fertig did not receive the medal of honor despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life others question why when fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men who were never in combat received that rank as the us army grew in size william manchester in his  biography of macarthur american caesar offers the opinion that macarthur and his staff may have had their own agenda in minimizing the efforts of fertig other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the philippines for example the american joint chiefs of staff authorized general macarthur to liberate the island of luzon but none of the other philippine islands after capturing luzon macarthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the joint chiefs manchester stated he macarthur wanted to become the liberator of the philippines the japanese armys practice of referring to fertig as major general fertig commander in chief in the philippines throughout the occupation period and its use of japanese military notation in referring to the th military district as the  army group did not endear fertig to macarthurs headquarters manchester also relates that lieutenant colonel courtney whitney an ultraconservative manila corporation lawyer was assigned to macarthurs staff promoted and assigned responsibility for philippine civil affairs manchester wrote from the standpoint of the guerrillas he was a disastrous choice undiplomatic and belligerent he was condescending toward all filipinos except those who like himself had substantial investments in the philippines and by the time macarthur was ready to land on leyte whitney had converted most of the staff to reactionaryism at his urging the general macarthur barred oss agents from the southwest pacific because whitney suspected they would aid leftwing guerrillas by minimizing the efforts of the guerrilla movement in freeing the philippines whitney also robbed it of political clout after the war to make any substantial liberal changes in philippine government and society after the war in may  colonel fertig was awarded the us army distinguished service medal the citation reads in part constantly engaged with vastly superior enemy forces he engendered filipino faith and confidence in their ultimate deliverance instilled in them the will to resist and united them in the cause of freedom by his outstanding courage tireless determination and brilliant leadership colonel fertig made an inestimable contribution to the liberation of the philippine islands after the war fertig spent four years as the officerincharge of rotc at the colorado school of mines a surprisingly lowlevel post after such a distinguished war time career however when the korean war began he spent two years at the pentagon with a psychological warfare unit from july  to june  he was the special forces plans officer in the office of the chief of psychological warfare with headquarters us army then from june  to august  he served as deputy chief of psychological warfare it was during this time that he helped establish the armys psychological warfare center at fort bragg north carolina which later became the john f kennedy special warfare center and school due to his wartime experiences and postwar work fertig is one of three men who used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of sf special forces and is considered one of the founding fathers of the us army special forces colonel fertig was released from active duty in the mids fertig was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao in june  wendell fertig and his wife returned to mindanao on a business trip as the interisland freighter pulled into cagayan the ships captain approached ferting and said sir i think friends await you as numerous small craft full of shouting men surrounded the ship wendell and mary fertig saw thousands of filipinos waiting at the waterfront at cagayan they had come from every corner of mindanao there were masses of women in the white uniforms of the womens auxiliary service and men wearing caps of the philippine veterans legion and the red fezzes of the moros the men were shouting and the women were singing they then saw a huge banner over the pier welcome the indomitable patriot who have lessened human suffering on mindanao wendell fertig ran a successful mining company in colorado until he died on  march  popular cultureedit a movie on wendell fertig has been in the planning stages for several years as of march  robert towne had finished the screenplay and it was presented to sony productions for final approval david fincher the director is eager to start production several movie web sites now list the movie but most state it is in development brad pitt with whom fincher

businessman wendell fertig  december  –  march  was an american civil engineer in the americanadministered commonwealth of the philippines who organized and commanded an americanfilipino guerrilla force on the japaneseoccupied southern philippine island of mindanao during world war ii fertig held a us army reserve commission and was called into military service before the war in the pacific began ordered from corregidor before its surrender to the japanese he was sent to mindanao to assume command of engineer activities there almost as soon as he arrived the us army forces on mindanao surrendered but fertig refused to do so fertig used his knowledge of the filipino people to organize them into a guerrilla army and civilian government he also used his engineering knowledge to solve problems in supply and construction fertig led the guerrillas against the japanese and their collaborators mostly in hitandrun raids and vital coast watching activities after making contact with us forces in the pacific the guerrillas began to receive supplies but never enough to stage large scale attacks more than once the japanese tried to destroy fertig and his guerrilla army committing large numbers of troops for this purpose at these times fertig had his forces retreat before the japanese until they were also dispersed then counterattacked the japanese with local superiority in numbers this continued until american forces returned to the philippines after the war fertig returned to his civilian engineering career but retained his reserve commission he spent four years as commander of the rotc detachment at the colorado school of mines his alma mater and served in a usbased psychological warfare unit during the korean war leaving active duty in the mids he ran a successful colorado mining company until his death during his postwar years he was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao and was a highly respected figure among the us special forces one authority lists him among the top ten guerrilla leaders in history contents  prewar  world war ii  early war experiences  avoiding capture  organizing the resistance  fighting the japanese  postwar  popular culture  decorations  see also  citations  references  external links prewaredit wendell fertig was born in la junta colorado where he lived until he completed high school he then studied engineering at the colorado school of mines in golden colorado after graduation from college he married his wife mary in  he and his family moved to the philippines where he had a successful career as a civil engineer until the war broke out fertig was described as tall sandyhaired with an athletic build and being calm genial deliberate and possessing a remarkable memory and a great facility for remembering names his experience as an engineer  and methods of attacking problems would serve him in the challenges he would face as the leader of the mindanao guerrillas it was due primarily to his personal leadership qualities that the mindanao resistance movement was unified under one leader and became the most successful of all the guerrilla units in the philippines early in  fertig was on leave in manila from his job on samar due to his military classes in college he held a reserve commission in the united states army corps of engineers as a result he was called to duty on  june  as a captain reserve in the army engineers as the united states prepared for war in the pacific theater at that time us analysts believed that the philippines might be one of the first areas japan would attack fertigs first assignments were as assistant engineer bataan field area then as engineer north luzon area by november  he was chief of the construction section general headquarters and spent most of his time overseeing preparation and improvement of airfields throughout the philippines in late  the us began evacuating the wives and children of military families in january  according to one of fertigs daughters mary fertig and their two children patricia hudson and jeannne left on the last evacuation ship and returned to the united states however other sources have fertigs family leaving the philippines as early as the summer of  this action was taken to relieve the concerns of officers and enlisted men called to duty about the welfare of their families american civilian families men women and children were not evacuated so as not to lessen the morale of the citizens of the philippines the native people of the philippines who could not leave suffered terribly under the japanese occupation it is estimated that at least one out of every  filipinos died at the hands of the japanese during the occupation world war iiedit early war experiencesedit on  december  japanese troops invaded the philippines among fertigs duties during the retreat to bataan and corregidor was the destruction of supplies left behind by retreating american forces his attention to detail was such that he even drove his new dodge car off a pier and into manila bay promoted twice by april  fertig—by then a lieutenant colonel—was sent from bataan on luzon to mindanao by general edward p king luzon force commander to assist general william f sharp mindanao force commander in the construction of airfields in they fought alone the author states that lt colonel fertig was ordered off corregidor to join general douglas macarthurs headquarters in australia however since he was not known to members of macarthurs headquarters in australia it is probably correct that he was ordered to mindanao to assist american forces there fertig arrived on mindanao on  april  and was assigned to supervise the demolition of main roads and bridges to prevent their use by the japanese avoiding captureedit after the us forces in and around the island of luzon surrendered in may  fertig decided not to give himself up to the japanese when another fleeing officer accompanying him asked what they were going to do fertig replied any damn thing but surrender during his movement from corregidor to mindanao fertig survived or avoided a number of airplane crashes as a result he felt that he was destined for something special later after organizing the guerrilla forces on mindanao he wrote in this diary i am called on to lead a resistance movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances but i feel that i am indeed a man of destiny that my course is charted and that only success lies at the end of the trail i do not envision failure it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time in the end we will be successful colonel fertig wearing red goatee during the war upon learning of the surrender of the american forces under general wainwright fertig spent weeks crossing the mountains and jungles in an attempt to contact general sharp upon learning that sharp had surrendered his forces to the japanese on  may  fertig then spent more weeks considering his options realizing that to gain face and authority he had to wait until guerrillas contacted him fertig monitored the military and political situation in mindanao by means of the jungle telegraph fertig also grew a red goatee believing that it would make him look older and wiser among a people who believed that age brought wisdom to the filipinos fertig would become known simply as tatay father many of the emerging guerrilla forces at that time were simply bandit groups pretending to fight the japanese but really using the collapse of the americansupported government to set themselves up as rulers of local areas these groups competed with each other for territory and authority on  september  the leader of one strong group approached fertig hoping to use him as a front ie representing american military forces to assume authority over the entire island fertig consented but then used his knowledge of the filipino people and the current situation in mindanao to eventually take over the command of that group and then others recognizing that he needed a higher rank so he would be taken seriously by potential recruits to his struggle including the leaders of other existing guerrilla bands fertig promoted himself to brigadier general this selfpromotion to brigadier general did not endear him to general macarthur or his staff but macarthur did send logistical support to fertig throughout  and  organizing the resistanceedit japanese bombings destruction by retreating american troops deprivations by bandit guerrilla bands and hoarding by civilians had significantly reduced available war supplies as well as those items necessary to run an effective government fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped americans and resisting filipinos to create many supplies from scratch for example tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for  caliber rifles steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles money was printed in both english and the local language using wooden blocks and fisherman towed japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel often seemingly impossible problems were overcome simply through perseverance for example gerardo almendres a filipino high school student had sent away for an international correspondence schools course on radios shortly before the war started fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though almendres had never handled one almendres was assisted by a filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another filipino who once had listened to a radio radio parts vacuum tubes and other electrical parts were scrounged from old radio receivers and sound equipment from an old movie projector and other electrical devices their makeshift radio eventually worked and they began to receive transmissions from other radios including those of roy bell on negros who traveled to fertigs camp and devised a new aerial however they had no way of knowing if their own transmissions were successful until on  january  the us navy radio monitoring station in san francisco answered their call sign robert c ball william f konko and stewart willever jr became fertigs signal corps– this was an extremely important accomplishment as american military commands in the pacific had no idea that there was any effective armed resistance on mindanao or even in the philippines general charles willoughby macarthurs intelligence chief had assured him that there was no possibility of such the american command in the pacific first heard of fertig when the japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed major general fertig but the americans simply dismissed it as propaganda it took weeks before american intelligence was able to confirm who fertig was and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the japanese part of this investigative process involved mary fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husbands life mrs fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last american plane leaving mindanao a phrase in the letter pineapples for breakfast let mrs fertig know that her husband was alive and well on mindanao as that is where they spent short vacations and while there he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast the latest american intelligence had placed fertig on corregidor at the time of the surrender and so the us army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the japanese in february  with tenuous communication established general macarthur appointed fertig as commanding officer of the th military district on mindanao during the initial exchange of messages macarthur disallowed any promotion of american armed forces personnel in the philippines to general rank as a result fertig reduced himself in rank to colonel but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a filipino metalsmith due to the difficulty in communicating with fertig and his command because of the makeshift radio almendres had built a submarine loaded with military and medical supplies was eventually sent to mindanao arriving on  march  it also carried two americans who had known fertig in the philippines one was charles smith who on  december  had escaped with two other americans and two filipinos by sailing a small boat to australia perhaps at that time the longest openboat voyage since captain blighs smith was now a captain in us army intelligence the other was charles parsons formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in us navy intelligence in addition to his other prewar business interests in manila parsons had represented panama as its resident counsel when the japanese occupied manila parsons was careful to speak only spanish and convinced the japanese he was a citizen of panama as a result the japanese eventually sent parsons and his family on a long journey back to panama but when the swedish ship carrying them docked in new york and before he could report to us intelligence fbi agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked parsons who he was and quickly hustled him and his family ashore however another source states that parsons reported to us intelligence in the canal zone after the ship docked in panama it was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the german italian or other legations who knew parsons true citizenship status exposed his masquerade to the japanese their role as smith and parsons immediately explained to fertig was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and if so was it worth the risk of men and supplies to support him at the same time parsons and smith brought fertig some unpleasant orders from macarthurs headquarters the american army was willing to provide radios and other equipment for fertigs command but these were only to be used for passing information on japanese activities from coastwatchers and other sources to australia the guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the japanese fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support however due to the numerous atrocities that the japanese were committing against the philippine population the only way that fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning so as to provide the filipinos an outlet for revenge against the japanese fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the japanese then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with macarthurs headquarters and its directives in addition general charles a willoughby macarthurs chief of intelligence was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources if a regular us army had been defeated by the japanese in the philippines then no irregular force could do better the guerrillas only purpose was to provide intelligence and later if fully equipped prior to the return of american forces to the philippines to fight as regular forces under the command of american officers fertig needed experienced american soldiers to train the filipino guerrillas the almost total lack of supplies was a serious problem but it was not the most pressing problem fertig faced at the time of the japanese invasion most philippine army units were of low quality they were not only poorly trained enough time not having passed to do so but they were underequipped and did not have the firepower to resist better armed japanese troops tanks and planes most of the soldiers were barefoot and many of their world war i era weapons lacked replacement parts and did not operate properly as a result many filipino units fled when attacked by the japanese this was symptomatic of fertigs most pressing need—experienced leaders he knew that eventually numerous leaders would emerge from the filipinos some guerrilla bands already had strong leaders but he needed them now his best resource for this leadership cadre was american servicemen who had either not surrendered or had escaped from prisonerofwar camps many were already fighting as guerrilla leaders or eager to so others joined him after he explained the need for their services but many others were not willing and demanded they be sent to australia where they could rejoin regular units fertigs reaction was not always one of understanding he told many that they would be returned when a means was found but that they would never be allowed to return others he removed from duty when it was apparent they did not have the leadership skills required eventually they were also returned to australia by submarine many with negative reports on their behavior some regular army personnel resented being commanded by a civilian turned soldier even if he had been in the philippines more years than they had many of the younger americans had disobeyed the orders to surrender due to their individualism others had used their cunning to evade the japanese or escape from the pow camps these traits sometimes led to clashes with the older men who had lived in the philippines for years and were now in command positions due to their reserve commissions or promotion by fertig as a result those who departed did not always report favorably on fertig once they reached macarthurs headquarters in australia those who stayed and fought received immediate commissions or were promoted if they already were officers in the us army although they might be sailors marines or even civilians macarthur eventually approved all of fertigs promotions even though advised not to do so by lt colonel courtney whitney his staff officer for filipino civilian affairs fighting the japaneseedit colonel fertig slowly assumed control over more of the existing rival guerrilla units on mindanao and turned them to harassing the japanese over the next two and a half years fertig created and commanded the mindanao segment of the united states forces in the philippines usfip recruiting escaped prisonersofwar and soldiers and american civilians who had refused to surrender however his real strength came from the thousands of patriotic filipinos many of whom were enraged by japanese atrocities who now joined existing or formed new organizations under his command the japanese were not unaware of these activities especially as they began to suffer losses in men and equipment and lose control of large areas between  and  usfip conducted numerous raids against the japanese occupation forces on mindanao in order to both sustain fertigs operation with captured supplies and to carry on harassing operations against the japanese this caused discord between fertig and macarthurs headquarters the american south west pacific area command wanted fertig to man coastwatcher units to report on japanese movements especially shipping as its main effort however to retain the loyalty of his forces in the wake of japanese atrocities fertig also had to wage an active campaign to kill japanese and their collaborators as well as disrupt activities aimed at civilians attacks against the japanese often initiated terrible reprisals by the japanese against local civilians so fertig issued orders that the guerrillas on mindanao were to avoid situations that would result in such reprisals however due to the japanese callousness toward the local populations reprisals often still occurred in addition to ambushing occupying japanese forces filipino guerrillas provided valuable intelligence reports to allied strategists initially fertigs forces were able to repel japanese attempts to recapture territory held by the guerrillas the japanese could not take any major actions against usfip on mindanao as not only were they dealing with other resistance movements in the philippines but most of their combat troops had been deployed to other areas of the pacific however in late spring  the japanese began military actions on a large scale on mindanao in those areas affected usfip forces had to retreat and give up land established camps and government infrastructure to the stronger japanese forces as the guerrilla units and government infrastructure fled before the japanese forces something occurred which fertig had hoped for he called it the pillow effect by providing no resistance to a stronger force the guerrillas survived the japanese blow when the japanese withdrew the pillow expanded to its original shape as the companysized guerrilla units dissolved the japanese began breaking up their units into smaller groups—eventually into squads—to track down these smaller units then without any orders from above first two or three guerrillas then  or more then platoon and then companysized units reorganized and struck back at the smaller japanese units causing the japanese heavy casualties in hundreds of small fire fights the japanese responded by reforming into battalionsized units that needed large towns to support them eventually the japanese using  to  troops on mindanao held the large towns on the sea coast while the usfip held the rest of the countryside or approximately  of the island of mindanao the guerrillas were so effective in some areas local japanese commanders made separate truces with them in exchange for the guerrillas not attacking japanese troops the japanese agreed to stay out of those areas in august  based upon favorable reports to macarthur by parsons and smith fertig was promoted to full colonel by macarthur and received the distinguished service cross for his efforts on  august fertig received the following message in recognition of your meritorious services as district commander and extraordinary heroism in action during the period of  may  to  august  i have awarded you the distinguished service cross announcement of your award is published in go hqs usaffe dtd  august i congratulate you on the distinguished service to your country and to the filipino people that has so well earned for you such recognition and hope that in it you will find inspiration for even greater future service quezon congratulates you on promotion fertig even created a navy by arming several small merchant vessels which he used to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine these vessels also attacked japanese shipping primarily small intercoastal vessels and patrol boats the usfip navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers homemade cannons and even mortars later some used  mm cannons supplied by the us navy one vessel was even armored using large circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large japanese steamer and another a sailing ship armed with  mm cannon fought off japanese aircraft and actually shot one down perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a japanese mitsubishi medium bomber more importantly the crew salvaged a new japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent it out on the next submarine to australia one of fertigs most audacious ship captains was waldo neveling a german civilian soldier of fortune and an enemy alien fertig had commissioned into the us army another ship called the bastard was actually a foot whaleboat captained by australian robert jock mclaren an escaped prisonerofwar from the sandakan pow camp on borneo mclaren would sail his boat into japanese controlled ports in broad daylight shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar then turn tail and run to help prepare for the eventual invasion of american forces fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised one as long as  feet which took over a year to build the airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops all that was needed was a bulldozer to scrape off the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes some of these airstrips were later used by us marine corps squadrons to provide closeair support during the invasion early in  the japanese army once again launched a major effort in an attempt to destroy the guerrillas on mindanao although essentially a repeat of their previous failed efforts they came close to destroying the guerrillas not by eliminating them but by cutting off their sources of supplies this effort came to an abrupt end when the american army and navy launched their longawaited offensive against the philippines with a landing first on leyte and then on  april  on mindanao as the japanese army pulled its troops out of mindanao to defend other portions of the philippines american air and naval forces extracted a terrible toll on japanese shipping killing untold thousands of japanese troops when many of the survivors of the sinking ships swam ashore they found filipino guerrillas and civilians waiting for them on the beaches armed with bolos exhausted from the swim the japanese were unable to fight back against the terrible retribution the filipinos then extracted for the atrocities the japanese had perpetrated against them during the years of occupation the usfip also contributed heavily to coastwatching activities as requested by macarthurs headquarters fertigs coastwatchers provided information leading to the victories in the first battle of the philippine sea the great marianas turkey shoot and the battle of leyte gulf other intelligence gathered by fertigs guerrillas was so accurate aerial reconnaissance flights before attacks were often canceled so as not to warn the japanese the guerrillas often went to great risks to secure accurate information for example they would make pencilandpaper rubbings of the serial numbers on enemy artillery to prove the accuracy of their information however estimates of enemy strength in an area were sometimes unreliable as with the american forces now in the philippines the japanese were constantly moving their forces around to meet the threat lieutenant general robert eichelberger commanding the us eighth army often downplayed guerrilla intelligence but this was throughout the philippines as a whole for the th military district commanded by fertig he had this to say we did have considerable information about dispositions of enemy troop since guerrilla forces on mindanao were the most effective and best organized in the philippines but probably the best estimate of the value of guerrilla intelligence came from the japanese when they released an official communique stating that the americans had perfected a new aerial bomb which was attracted by concentrations of ammunition and fuel the bomb was simply accurate information on japanese installations supplied by the guerrillas as first american carrier planes then longdistance landbased planes began raids on the philippines the guerrillas became important for yet another reason as american pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by japanese antiaircraft fire they often found filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by filipinos in small swift boats often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships debriefing officers within a day or two fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing he knew they were more important flying missions against japanese targets besides colonel fertig now had a good supply of experienced battlehardened american and filipino leaders for his combat patrols the uss narwhal a submarine with a large cargo capacity made supply runs to the philippines from its humble beginnings usfip became one of the best equipped and most effective irregular units operating in world war ii when the submarine uss narwhal arrived at mindanao in nov  to deliver supplies the crew was met by a uniformed band playing stars and stripes forever although submarines had already delivered supplies to fertig and other guerrilla leaders the narwhals large size enabled it to deliver  tons of supplies at a time whereas other submarines could only deliver four tons or less this greatly increased the ability of the guerrilla forces not only to inflict damage to the enemy but also provide the necessary supplies to care for the medical health and wellbeing of the guerrilla forces and their civilian supporters in addition uss narwhal had the room to evacuate guerrillas needing critical medical care as well as american civilians primarily women and children who had been hiding out in the philippines and were suffering from malnutrition and diseases according to us navy records  of  resupply missions to the philippines were directed to mindanao between  january  and  january  for all of the philippines a total of  tons of supplies were landed with  people landed and another  evacuated filipino guerrillas secured airstrips for us planes on mindanao as an indicator of usfip strength on mindanao during january and february  in preparation for the return of regular american forces the guerrillas seized the dipolog airstrip in northern zamboanga and held it while surrounded by the japanese with the arrival of regular american forces in march  fertigs guerrilla forces participated in the battle of mindanao that effectively ended organized japanese resistance on that island they then disbanded on  september  the th infantry division of the philippine commonwealth army was reactivated and its ranks were heavily seeded with filipino veterans of the usfip at all levels of command american forces return to the philippines by late  fertig commanded a force estimated at between  and  effectives with most sources agreeing on —the equivalent of an army corps—with  of them armed officers with responsibility for corps command usually hold the rank of major general in addition fertig created and help administer the civilian government of mindanao while at the same time conducting the guerrilla war against the japanese the usfip killed at least  japanese soldiers and while a constant drain on japanese resources they also prevented the japanese from fully utilizing mindanaos resources in support of its war efforts at one time the japanese committed approximately  troops in an attempt to crush guerrilla resistance on mindanao troops that were desperately needed elsewhere throughout the entire philippines the guerrillas managed to tie down a japanese army of  troops of which approximately – were on mindanao depending on the time period after the war examination of japanese records indicated that the japanese high command felt that  battalions of troops would be needed to guard rear areas against guerrillas once the american invasion of the philippines began since seven divisions were slated to resist the invasion this resulted in a ratio of one reararea soldier to every three frontline troops ultimately the japanese concluded that it is impossible to fight the enemy and at the same time suppress the activities of the guerrillas while summarizing colonel wendell fertigs contributions to the american war effort and his leadership of the usfip on mindanao keats  states apart from his insistence on honesty and justice and the idea that the guerrilla army be a process of a responsible civil government his fundamental contribution to mindanao was his concern that the reward for performance should always be increased responsibility in his command demonstrated competence was the sole means to promotion and no man was denied an opportunity to prove himself this concept built a nation in north america and it built another on mindanao it was fertig more than any other man who gave the filipinos of mindanao increasing reason to believe in themselves this rather than a military victory was fertigs triumph the moro muslim datu pino sliced the ears off japanese and cashed them in with colonel fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and  centavos postwaredit some scholars question why fertig did not receive the medal of honor despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life others question why when fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men who were never in combat received that rank as the us army grew in size william manchester in his  biography of macarthur american caesar offers the opinion that macarthur and his staff may have had their own agenda in minimizing the efforts of fertig other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the philippines for example the american joint chiefs of staff authorized general macarthur to liberate the island of luzon but none of the other philippine islands after capturing luzon macarthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the joint chiefs manchester stated he macarthur wanted to become the liberator of the philippines the japanese armys practice of referring to fertig as major general fertig commander in chief in the philippines throughout the occupation period and its use of japanese military notation in referring to the th military district as the  army group did not endear fertig to macarthurs headquarters manchester also relates that lieutenant colonel courtney whitney an ultraconservative manila corporation lawyer was assigned to macarthurs staff promoted and assigned responsibility for philippine civil affairs manchester wrote from the standpoint of the guerrillas he was a disastrous choice undiplomatic and belligerent he was condescending toward all filipinos except those who like himself had substantial investments in the philippines and by the time macarthur was ready to land on leyte whitney had converted most of the staff to reactionaryism at his urging the general macarthur barred oss agents from the southwest pacific because whitney suspected they would aid leftwing guerrillas by minimizing the efforts of the guerrilla movement in freeing the philippines whitney also robbed it of political clout after the war to make any substantial liberal changes in philippine government and society after the war in may  colonel fertig was awarded the us army distinguished service medal the citation reads in part constantly engaged with vastly superior enemy forces he engendered filipino faith and confidence in their ultimate deliverance instilled in them the will to resist and united them in the cause of freedom by his outstanding courage tireless determination and brilliant leadership colonel fertig made an inestimable contribution to the liberation of the philippine islands after the war fertig spent four years as the officerincharge of rotc at the colorado school of mines a surprisingly lowlevel post after such a distinguished war time career however when the korean war began he spent two years at the pentagon with a psychological warfare unit from july  to june  he was the special forces plans officer in the office of the chief of psychological warfare with headquarters us army then from june  to august  he served as deputy chief of psychological warfare it was during this time that he helped establish the armys psychological warfare center at fort bragg north carolina which later became the john f kennedy special warfare center and school due to his wartime experiences and postwar work fertig is one of three men who used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of sf special forces and is considered one of the founding fathers of the us army special forces colonel fertig was released from active duty in the mids fertig was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao in june  wendell fertig and his wife returned to mindanao on a business trip as the interisland freighter pulled into cagayan the ships captain approached ferting and said sir i think friends await you as numerous small craft full of shouting men surrounded the ship wendell and mary fertig saw thousands of filipinos waiting at the waterfront at cagayan they had come from every corner of mindanao there were masses of women in the white uniforms of the womens auxiliary service and men wearing caps of the philippine veterans legion and the red fezzes of the moros the men were shouting and the women were singing they then saw a huge banner over the pier welcome the indomitable patriot who have lessened human suffering on mindanao wendell fertig ran a successful mining company in colorado until he died on  march  popular cultureedit a movie on wendell fertig has been in the planning stages for several years as of march  robert towne had finished the screenplay and it was presented to sony productions for final approval david fincher the director is eager to start production several movie web sites now list the movie but most state it is in development brad pitt with whom fincher has worked before is listed in the role of fertig the new york times site lists columbia tristar motion picture group as the studio sony pictures as the domestic theatrical distributor and red wagon entertainment as the production company wendell fertig and some fictionalized actions of the us forces in the

philippines who organized and commanded an americanfilipino guerrilla force on the japaneseoccupied southern philippine island of mindanao during world war ii fertig held a us army reserve commission and was called into military service before the war in the pacific began ordered from corregidor before its surrender to the japanese he was sent to mindanao to assume command of engineer activities there almost as soon as he arrived the us army forces on mindanao surrendered but fertig refused to do so fertig used his knowledge of the filipino people to organize them into a guerrilla army and civilian government he also used his engineering knowledge to solve problems in supply and construction fertig led the guerrillas against the japanese and their collaborators mostly in hitandrun raids and vital coast watching activities after making contact with us forces in the pacific the guerrillas began to receive supplies but never enough to stage large scale attacks more than once the japanese tried to destroy fertig and his guerrilla army committing large numbers of troops for this purpose at these times fertig had his forces retreat before the japanese until they were also dispersed then counterattacked the japanese with local superiority in numbers this continued until american forces returned to the philippines after the war fertig returned to his civilian engineering career but retained his reserve commission he spent four years as commander of the rotc detachment at the colorado school of mines his alma mater and served in a usbased psychological warfare unit during the korean war leaving active duty in the mids he ran a successful colorado mining company until his death during his postwar years he was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao and was a highly respected figure among the us special forces one authority lists him among the top ten guerrilla leaders in history contents  prewar  world war ii  early war experiences  avoiding capture  organizing the resistance  fighting the japanese  postwar  popular culture  decorations  see also  citations  references  external links prewaredit wendell fertig was born in la junta colorado where he lived until he completed high school he then studied engineering at the colorado school of mines in golden colorado after graduation from college he married his wife mary in  he and his family moved to the philippines where he had a successful career as a civil engineer until the war broke out fertig was described as tall sandyhaired with an athletic build and being calm genial deliberate and possessing a remarkable memory and a great facility for remembering names his experience as an engineer  and methods of attacking problems would serve him in the challenges he would face as the leader of the mindanao guerrillas it was due primarily to his personal leadership qualities that the mindanao resistance movement was unified under one leader and became the most successful of all the guerrilla units in the philippines early in  fertig was on leave in manila from his job on samar due to his military classes in college he held a reserve commission in the united states army corps of engineers as a result he was called to duty on  june  as a captain reserve in the army engineers as the united states prepared for war in the pacific theater at that time us analysts believed that the philippines might be one of the first areas japan would attack fertigs first assignments were as assistant engineer bataan field area then as engineer north luzon area by november  he was chief of the construction section general headquarters and spent most of his time overseeing preparation and improvement of airfields throughout the philippines in late  the us began evacuating the wives and children of military families in january  according to one of fertigs daughters mary fertig and their two children patricia hudson and jeannne left on the last evacuation ship and returned to the united states however other sources have fertigs family leaving the philippines as early as the summer of  this action was taken to relieve the concerns of officers and enlisted men called to duty about the welfare of their families american civilian families men women and children were not evacuated so as not to lessen the morale of the citizens of the philippines the native people of the philippines who could not leave suffered terribly under the japanese occupation it is estimated that at least one out of every  filipinos died at the hands of the japanese during the occupation world war iiedit early war experiencesedit on  december  japanese troops invaded the philippines among fertigs duties during the retreat to bataan and corregidor was the destruction of supplies left behind by retreating american forces his attention to detail was such that he even drove his new dodge car off a pier and into manila bay promoted twice by april  fertig—by then a lieutenant colonel—was sent from bataan on luzon to mindanao by general edward p king luzon force commander to assist general william f sharp mindanao force commander in the construction of airfields in they fought alone the author states that lt colonel fertig was ordered off corregidor to join general douglas macarthurs headquarters in australia however since he was not known to members of macarthurs headquarters in australia it is probably correct that he was ordered to mindanao to assist american forces there fertig arrived on mindanao on  april  and was assigned to supervise the demolition of main roads and bridges to prevent their use by the japanese avoiding captureedit after the us forces in and around the island of luzon surrendered in may  fertig decided not to give himself up to the japanese when another fleeing officer accompanying him asked what they were going to do fertig replied any damn thing but surrender during his movement from corregidor to mindanao fertig survived or avoided a number of airplane crashes as a result he felt that he was destined for something special later after organizing the guerrilla forces on mindanao he wrote in this diary i am called on to lead a resistance movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances but i feel that i am indeed a man of destiny that my course is charted and that only success lies at the end of the trail i do not envision failure it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time in the end we will be successful colonel fertig wearing red goatee during the war upon learning of the surrender of the american forces under general wainwright fertig spent weeks crossing the mountains and jungles in an attempt to contact general sharp upon learning that sharp had surrendered his forces to the japanese on  may  fertig then spent more weeks considering his options realizing that to gain face and authority he had to wait until guerrillas contacted him fertig monitored the military and political situation in mindanao by means of the jungle telegraph fertig also grew a red goatee believing that it would make him look older and wiser among a people who believed that age brought wisdom to the filipinos fertig would become known simply as tatay father many of the emerging guerrilla forces at that time were simply bandit groups pretending to fight the japanese but really using the collapse of the americansupported government to set themselves up as rulers of local areas these groups competed with each other for territory and authority on  september  the leader of one strong group approached fertig hoping to use him as a front ie representing american military forces to assume authority over the entire island fertig consented but then used his knowledge of the filipino people and the current situation in mindanao to eventually take over the command of that group and then others recognizing that he needed a higher rank so he would be taken seriously by potential recruits to his struggle including the leaders of other existing guerrilla bands fertig promoted himself to brigadier general this selfpromotion to brigadier general did not endear him to general macarthur or his staff but macarthur did send logistical support to fertig throughout  and  organizing the resistanceedit japanese bombings destruction by retreating american troops deprivations by bandit guerrilla bands and hoarding by civilians had significantly reduced available war supplies as well as those items necessary to run an effective government fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped americans and resisting filipinos to create many supplies from scratch for example tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for  caliber rifles steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles money was printed in both english and the local language using wooden blocks and fisherman towed japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel often seemingly impossible problems were overcome simply through perseverance for example gerardo almendres a filipino high school student had sent away for an international correspondence schools course on radios shortly before the war started fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though almendres had never handled one almendres was assisted by a filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another filipino who once had listened to a radio radio parts vacuum tubes and other electrical parts were scrounged from old radio receivers and sound equipment from an old movie projector and other electrical devices their makeshift radio eventually worked and they began to receive transmissions from other radios including those of roy bell on negros who traveled to fertigs camp and devised a new aerial however they had no way of knowing if their own transmissions were successful until on  january  the us navy radio monitoring station in san francisco answered their call sign robert c ball william f konko and stewart willever jr became fertigs signal corps– this was an extremely important accomplishment as american military commands in the pacific had no idea that there was any effective armed resistance on mindanao or even in the philippines general charles willoughby macarthurs intelligence chief had assured him that there was no possibility of such the american command in the pacific first heard of fertig when the japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed major general fertig but the americans simply dismissed it as propaganda it took weeks before american intelligence was able to confirm who fertig was and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the japanese part of this investigative process involved mary fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husbands life mrs fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last american plane leaving mindanao a phrase in the letter pineapples for breakfast let mrs fertig know that her husband was alive and well on mindanao as that is where they spent short vacations and while there he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast the latest american intelligence had placed fertig on corregidor at the time of the surrender and so the us army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the japanese in february  with tenuous communication established general macarthur appointed fertig as commanding officer of the th military district on mindanao during the initial exchange of messages macarthur disallowed any promotion of american armed forces personnel in the philippines to general rank as a result fertig reduced himself in rank to colonel but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a filipino metalsmith due to the difficulty in communicating with fertig and his command because of the makeshift radio almendres had built a submarine loaded with military and medical supplies was eventually sent to mindanao arriving on  march  it also carried two americans who had known fertig in the philippines one was charles smith who on  december  had escaped with two other americans and two filipinos by sailing a small boat to australia perhaps at that time the longest openboat voyage since captain blighs smith was now a captain in us army intelligence the other was charles parsons formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in us navy intelligence in addition to his other prewar business interests in manila parsons had represented panama as its resident counsel when the japanese occupied manila parsons was careful to speak only spanish and convinced the japanese he was a citizen of panama as a result the japanese eventually sent parsons and his family on a long journey back to panama but when the swedish ship carrying them docked in new york and before he could report to us intelligence fbi agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked parsons who he was and quickly hustled him and his family ashore however another source states that parsons reported to us intelligence in the canal zone after the ship docked in panama it was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the german italian or other legations who knew parsons true citizenship status exposed his masquerade to the japanese their role as smith and parsons immediately explained to fertig was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and if so was it worth the risk of men and supplies to support him at the same time parsons and smith brought fertig some unpleasant orders from macarthurs headquarters the american army was willing to provide radios and other equipment for fertigs command but these were only to be used for passing information on japanese activities from coastwatchers and other sources to australia the guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the japanese fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support however due to the numerous atrocities that the japanese were committing against the philippine population the only way that fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning so as to provide the filipinos an outlet for revenge against the japanese fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the japanese then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with macarthurs headquarters and its directives in addition general charles a willoughby macarthurs chief of intelligence was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources if a regular us army had been defeated by the japanese in the philippines then no irregular force could do better the guerrillas only purpose was to provide intelligence and later if fully equipped prior to the return of american forces to the philippines to fight as regular forces under the command of american officers fertig needed experienced american soldiers to train the filipino guerrillas the almost total lack of supplies was a serious problem but it was not the most pressing problem fertig faced at the time of the japanese invasion most philippine army units were of low quality they were not only poorly trained enough time not having passed to do so but they were underequipped and did not have the firepower to resist better armed japanese troops tanks and planes most of the soldiers were barefoot and many of their world war i era weapons lacked replacement parts and did not operate properly as a result many filipino units fled when attacked by the japanese this was symptomatic of fertigs most pressing need—experienced leaders he knew that eventually numerous leaders would emerge from the filipinos some guerrilla bands already had strong leaders but he needed them now his best resource for this leadership cadre was american servicemen who had either not surrendered or had escaped from prisonerofwar camps many were already fighting as guerrilla leaders or eager to so others joined him after he explained the need for their services but many others were not willing and demanded they be sent to australia where they could rejoin regular units fertigs reaction was not always one of understanding he told many that they would be returned when a means was found but that they would never be allowed to return others he removed from duty when it was apparent they did not have the leadership skills required eventually they were also returned to australia by submarine many with negative reports on their behavior some regular army personnel resented being commanded by a civilian turned soldier even if he had been in the philippines more years than they had many of the younger americans had disobeyed the orders to surrender due to their individualism others had used their cunning to evade the japanese or escape from the pow camps these traits sometimes led to clashes with the older men who had lived in the philippines for years and were now in command positions due to their reserve commissions or promotion by fertig as a result those who departed did not always report favorably on fertig once they reached macarthurs headquarters in australia those who stayed and fought received immediate commissions or were promoted if they already were officers in the us army although they might be sailors marines or even civilians macarthur eventually approved all of fertigs promotions even though advised not to do so by lt colonel courtney whitney his staff officer for filipino civilian affairs fighting the japaneseedit colonel fertig slowly assumed control over more of the existing rival guerrilla units on mindanao and turned them to harassing the japanese over the next two and a half years fertig created and commanded the mindanao segment of the united states forces in the philippines usfip recruiting escaped prisonersofwar and soldiers and american civilians who had refused to surrender however his real strength came from the thousands of patriotic filipinos many of whom were enraged by japanese atrocities who now joined existing or formed new organizations under his command the japanese were not unaware of these activities especially as they began to suffer losses in men and equipment and lose control of large areas between  and  usfip conducted numerous raids against the japanese occupation forces on mindanao in order to both sustain fertigs operation with captured supplies and to carry on harassing operations against the japanese this caused discord between fertig and macarthurs headquarters the american south west pacific area command wanted fertig to man coastwatcher units to report on japanese movements especially shipping as its main effort however to retain the loyalty of his forces in the wake of japanese atrocities fertig also had to wage an active campaign to kill japanese and their collaborators as well as disrupt activities aimed at civilians attacks against the japanese often initiated terrible reprisals by the japanese against local civilians so fertig issued orders that the guerrillas on mindanao were to avoid situations that would result in such reprisals however due to the japanese callousness toward the local populations reprisals often still occurred in addition to ambushing occupying japanese forces filipino guerrillas provided valuable intelligence reports to allied strategists initially fertigs forces were able to repel japanese attempts to recapture territory held by the guerrillas the japanese could not take any major actions against usfip on mindanao as not only were they dealing with other resistance movements in the philippines but most of their combat troops had been deployed to other areas of the pacific however in late spring  the japanese began military actions on a large scale on mindanao in those areas affected usfip forces had to retreat and give up land established camps and government infrastructure to the stronger japanese forces as the guerrilla units and government infrastructure fled before the japanese forces something occurred which fertig had hoped for he called it the pillow effect by providing no resistance to a stronger force the guerrillas survived the japanese blow when the japanese withdrew the pillow expanded to its original shape as the companysized guerrilla units dissolved the japanese began breaking up their units into smaller groups—eventually into squads—to track down these smaller units then without any orders from above first two or three guerrillas then  or more then platoon and then companysized units reorganized and struck back at the smaller japanese units causing the japanese heavy casualties in hundreds of small fire fights the japanese responded by reforming into battalionsized units that needed large towns to support them eventually the japanese using  to  troops on mindanao held the large towns on the sea coast while the usfip held the rest of the countryside or approximately  of the island of mindanao the guerrillas were so effective in some areas local japanese commanders made separate truces with them in exchange for the guerrillas not attacking japanese troops the japanese agreed to stay out of those areas in august  based upon favorable reports to macarthur by parsons and smith fertig was promoted to full colonel by macarthur and received the distinguished service cross for his efforts on  august fertig received the following message in recognition of your meritorious services as district commander and extraordinary heroism in action during the period of  may  to  august  i have awarded you the distinguished service cross announcement of your award is published in go hqs usaffe dtd  august i congratulate you on the distinguished service to your country and to the filipino people that has so well earned for you such recognition and hope that in it you will find inspiration for even greater future service quezon congratulates you on promotion fertig even created a navy by arming several small merchant vessels which he used to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine these vessels also attacked japanese shipping primarily small intercoastal vessels and patrol boats the usfip navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers homemade cannons and even mortars later some used  mm cannons supplied by the us navy one vessel was even armored using large circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large japanese steamer and another a sailing ship armed with  mm cannon fought off japanese aircraft and actually shot one down perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a japanese mitsubishi medium bomber more importantly the crew salvaged a new japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent it out on the next submarine to australia one of fertigs most audacious ship captains was waldo neveling a german civilian soldier of fortune and an enemy alien fertig had commissioned into the us army another ship called the bastard was actually a foot whaleboat captained by australian robert jock mclaren an escaped prisonerofwar from the sandakan pow camp on borneo mclaren would sail his boat into japanese controlled ports in broad daylight shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar then turn tail and run to help prepare for the eventual invasion of american forces fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised one as long as  feet which took over a year to build the airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops all that was needed was a bulldozer to scrape off the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes some of these airstrips were later used by us marine corps squadrons to provide closeair support during the invasion early in  the japanese army once again launched a major effort in an attempt to destroy the guerrillas on mindanao although essentially a repeat of their previous failed efforts they came close to destroying the guerrillas not by eliminating them but by cutting off their sources of supplies this effort came to an abrupt end when the american army and navy launched their longawaited offensive against the philippines with a landing first on leyte and then on  april  on mindanao as the japanese army pulled its troops out of mindanao to defend other portions of the philippines american air and naval forces extracted a terrible toll on japanese shipping killing untold thousands of japanese troops when many of the survivors of the sinking ships swam ashore they found filipino guerrillas and civilians waiting for them on the beaches armed with bolos exhausted from the swim the japanese were unable to fight back against the terrible retribution the filipinos then extracted for the atrocities the japanese had perpetrated against them during the years of occupation the usfip also contributed heavily to coastwatching activities as requested by macarthurs headquarters fertigs coastwatchers provided information leading to the victories in the first battle of the philippine sea the great marianas turkey shoot and the battle of leyte gulf other intelligence gathered by fertigs guerrillas was so accurate aerial reconnaissance flights before attacks were often canceled so as not to warn the japanese the guerrillas often went to great risks to secure accurate information for example they would make pencilandpaper rubbings of the serial numbers on enemy artillery to prove the accuracy of their information however estimates of enemy strength in an area were sometimes unreliable as with the american forces now in the philippines the japanese were constantly moving their forces around to meet the threat lieutenant general robert eichelberger commanding the us eighth army often downplayed guerrilla intelligence but this was throughout the philippines as a whole for the th military district commanded by fertig he had this to say we did have considerable information about dispositions of enemy troop since guerrilla forces on mindanao were the most effective and best organized in the philippines but probably the best estimate of the value of guerrilla intelligence came from the japanese when they released an official communique stating that the americans had perfected a new aerial bomb which was attracted by concentrations of ammunition and fuel the bomb was simply accurate information on japanese installations supplied by the guerrillas as first american carrier planes then longdistance landbased planes began raids on the philippines the guerrillas became important for yet another reason as american pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by japanese antiaircraft fire they often found filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by filipinos in small swift boats often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships debriefing officers within a day or two fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing he knew they were more important flying missions against japanese targets besides colonel fertig now had a good supply of experienced battlehardened american and filipino leaders for his combat patrols the uss narwhal a submarine with a large cargo capacity made supply runs to the philippines from its humble beginnings usfip became one of the best equipped and most effective irregular units operating in world war ii when the submarine uss narwhal arrived at mindanao in nov  to deliver supplies the crew was met by a uniformed band playing stars and stripes forever although submarines had already delivered supplies to fertig and other guerrilla leaders the narwhals large size enabled it to deliver  tons of supplies at a time whereas other submarines could only deliver four tons or less this greatly increased the ability of the guerrilla forces not only to inflict damage to the enemy but also provide the necessary supplies to care for the medical health and wellbeing of the guerrilla forces and their civilian supporters in addition uss narwhal had the room to evacuate guerrillas needing critical medical care as well as american civilians primarily women and children who had been hiding out in the philippines and were suffering from malnutrition and diseases according to us navy records  of  resupply missions to the philippines were directed to mindanao between  january  and  january  for all of the philippines a total of  tons of supplies were landed with  people landed and another  evacuated filipino guerrillas secured airstrips for us planes on mindanao as an indicator of usfip strength on mindanao during january and february  in preparation for the return of regular american forces the guerrillas seized the dipolog airstrip in northern zamboanga and held it while surrounded by the japanese with the arrival of regular american forces in march  fertigs guerrilla forces participated in the battle of mindanao that effectively ended organized japanese resistance on that island they then disbanded on  september  the th infantry division of the philippine commonwealth army was reactivated and its ranks were heavily seeded with filipino veterans of the usfip at all levels of command american forces return to the philippines by late  fertig commanded a force estimated at between  and  effectives with most sources agreeing on —the equivalent of an army corps—with  of them armed officers with responsibility for corps command usually hold the rank of major general in addition fertig created and help administer the civilian government of mindanao while at the same time conducting the guerrilla war against the japanese the usfip killed at least  japanese soldiers and while a constant drain on japanese resources they also prevented the japanese from fully utilizing mindanaos resources in support of its war efforts at one time the japanese committed approximately  troops in an attempt to crush guerrilla resistance on mindanao troops that were desperately needed elsewhere throughout the entire philippines the guerrillas managed to tie down a japanese army of  troops of which approximately – were on mindanao depending on the time period after the war examination of japanese records indicated that the japanese high command felt that  battalions of troops would be needed to guard rear areas against guerrillas once the american invasion of the philippines began since seven divisions were slated to resist the invasion this resulted in a ratio of one reararea soldier to every three frontline troops ultimately the japanese concluded that it is impossible to fight the enemy and at the same time suppress the activities of the guerrillas while summarizing colonel wendell fertigs contributions to the american war effort and his leadership of the usfip on mindanao keats  states apart from his insistence on honesty and justice and the idea that the guerrilla army be a process of a responsible civil government his fundamental contribution to mindanao was his concern that the reward for performance should always be increased responsibility in his command demonstrated competence was the sole means to promotion and no man was denied an opportunity to prove himself this concept built a nation in north america and it built another on mindanao it was fertig more than any other man who gave the filipinos of mindanao increasing reason to believe in themselves this rather than a military victory was fertigs triumph the moro muslim datu pino sliced the ears off japanese and cashed them in with colonel fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and  centavos postwaredit some scholars question why fertig did not receive the medal of honor despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life others question why when fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men who were never in combat received that rank as the us army grew in size william manchester in his  biography of macarthur american caesar offers the opinion that macarthur and his staff may have had their own agenda in minimizing the efforts of fertig other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the philippines for example the american joint chiefs of staff authorized general macarthur to liberate the island of luzon but none of the other philippine islands after capturing luzon macarthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the joint chiefs manchester stated he macarthur wanted to become the liberator of the philippines the japanese armys practice of referring to fertig as major general fertig commander in chief in the philippines throughout the occupation period and its use of japanese military notation in referring to the th military district as the  army group did not endear fertig to macarthurs headquarters manchester also relates that lieutenant colonel courtney whitney an ultraconservative manila corporation lawyer was assigned to macarthurs staff promoted and assigned responsibility for philippine civil affairs manchester wrote from the standpoint of the guerrillas he was a disastrous choice undiplomatic and belligerent he was condescending toward all filipinos except those who like himself had substantial investments in the philippines and by the time macarthur was ready to land on leyte whitney had converted most of the staff to reactionaryism at his urging the general macarthur barred oss agents from the southwest pacific because whitney suspected they would aid leftwing guerrillas by minimizing the efforts of the guerrilla movement in freeing the philippines whitney also robbed it of political clout after the war to make any substantial liberal changes in philippine government and society after the war in may  colonel fertig was awarded the us army distinguished service medal the citation reads in part constantly engaged with vastly superior enemy forces he engendered filipino faith and confidence in their ultimate deliverance instilled in them the will to resist and united them in the cause of freedom by his outstanding courage tireless determination and brilliant leadership colonel fertig made an inestimable contribution to the liberation of the philippine islands after the war fertig spent four years as the officerincharge of rotc at the colorado school of mines a surprisingly lowlevel post after such a distinguished war time career however when the korean war began he spent two years at the pentagon with a psychological warfare unit from july  to june  he was the special forces plans officer in the office of the chief of psychological warfare with headquarters us army then from june  to august  he served as deputy chief of psychological warfare it was during this time that he helped establish the armys psychological warfare center at fort bragg north carolina which later became the john f kennedy special warfare center and school due to his wartime experiences and postwar work fertig is one of three men who used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of sf special forces and is considered one of the founding fathers of the us army special forces colonel fertig was released from active duty in the mids fertig was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao in june  wendell fertig and his wife returned to mindanao on a business trip as the interisland freighter pulled into cagayan the ships captain approached ferting and said sir i think friends await you

businessman wendell fertig  december  –  march  was an american civil engineer in the americanadministered commonwealth of the philippines who organized and commanded an americanfilipino guerrilla force on the japaneseoccupied southern philippine island of mindanao during world war ii fertig held a us army reserve commission and was called into military service before the war in the pacific began ordered from corregidor before its surrender to the japanese he was sent to mindanao to assume command of engineer activities there almost as soon as he arrived the us army forces on mindanao surrendered but fertig refused to do so fertig used his knowledge of the filipino people to organize them into a guerrilla army and civilian government he also used his engineering knowledge to solve problems in supply and construction fertig led the guerrillas against the japanese and their collaborators mostly in hitandrun raids and vital coast watching activities after making contact with us forces in the pacific the guerrillas began to receive supplies but never enough to stage large scale attacks more than once the japanese tried to destroy fertig and his guerrilla army committing large numbers of troops for this purpose at these times fertig had his forces retreat before the japanese until they were also dispersed then counterattacked the japanese with local superiority in numbers this continued until american forces returned to the philippines after the war fertig returned to his civilian engineering career but retained his reserve commission he spent four years as commander of the rotc detachment at the colorado school of mines his alma mater and served in a usbased psychological warfare unit during the korean war leaving active duty in the mids he ran a successful colorado mining company until his death during his postwar years he was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao and was a highly respected figure among the us special forces one authority lists him among the top ten guerrilla leaders in history contents  prewar  world war ii  early war experiences  avoiding capture  organizing the resistance  fighting the japanese  postwar  popular culture  decorations  see also  citations  references  external links prewaredit wendell fertig was born in la junta colorado where he lived until he completed high school he then studied engineering at the colorado school of mines in golden colorado after graduation from college he married his wife mary in  he and his family moved to the philippines where he had a successful career as a civil engineer until the war broke out fertig was described as tall sandyhaired with an athletic build and being calm genial deliberate and possessing a remarkable memory and a great facility for remembering names his experience as an engineer  and methods of attacking problems would serve him in the challenges he would face as the leader of the mindanao guerrillas it was due primarily to his personal leadership qualities that the mindanao resistance movement was unified under one leader and became the most successful of all the guerrilla units in the philippines early in  fertig was on leave in manila from his job on samar due to his military classes in college he held a reserve commission in the united states army corps of engineers as a result he was called to duty on  june  as a captain reserve in the army engineers as the united states prepared for war in the pacific theater at that time us analysts believed that the philippines might be one of the first areas japan would attack fertigs first assignments were as assistant engineer bataan field area then as engineer north luzon area by november  he was chief of the construction section general headquarters and spent most of his time overseeing preparation and improvement of airfields throughout the philippines in late  the us began evacuating the wives and children of military families in january  according to one of fertigs daughters mary fertig and their two children patricia hudson and jeannne left on the last evacuation ship and returned to the united states however other sources have fertigs family leaving the philippines as early as the summer of  this action was taken to relieve the concerns of officers and enlisted men called to duty about the welfare of their families american civilian families men women and children were not evacuated so as not to lessen the morale of the citizens of the philippines the native people of the philippines who could not leave suffered terribly under the japanese occupation it is estimated that at least one out of every  filipinos died at the hands of the japanese during the occupation world war iiedit early war experiencesedit on  december  japanese troops invaded the philippines among fertigs duties during the retreat to bataan and corregidor was the destruction of supplies left behind by retreating american forces his attention to detail was such that he even drove his new dodge car off a pier and into manila bay promoted twice by april  fertig—by then a lieutenant colonel—was sent from bataan on luzon to mindanao by general edward p king luzon force commander to assist general william f sharp mindanao force commander in the construction of airfields in they fought alone the author states that lt colonel fertig was ordered off corregidor to join general douglas macarthurs headquarters in australia however since he was not known to members of macarthurs headquarters in australia it is probably correct that he was ordered to mindanao to assist american forces there fertig arrived on mindanao on  april  and was assigned to supervise the demolition of main roads and bridges to prevent their use by the japanese avoiding captureedit after the us forces in and around the island of luzon surrendered in may  fertig decided not to give himself up to the japanese when another fleeing officer accompanying him asked what they were going to do fertig replied any damn thing but surrender during his movement from corregidor to mindanao fertig survived or avoided a number of airplane crashes as a result he felt that he was destined for something special later after organizing the guerrilla forces on mindanao he wrote in this diary i am called on to lead a resistance movement against an implacable enemy under conditions that make victory barely possible even under the best circumstances but i feel that i am indeed a man of destiny that my course is charted and that only success lies at the end of the trail i do not envision failure it is obvious that the odds are against us and we will not consistently win but if we are to win only part of the time and gain a little each time in the end we will be successful colonel fertig wearing red goatee during the war upon learning of the surrender of the american forces under general wainwright fertig spent weeks crossing the mountains and jungles in an attempt to contact general sharp upon learning that sharp had surrendered his forces to the japanese on  may  fertig then spent more weeks considering his options realizing that to gain face and authority he had to wait until guerrillas contacted him fertig monitored the military and political situation in mindanao by means of the jungle telegraph fertig also grew a red goatee believing that it would make him look older and wiser among a people who believed that age brought wisdom to the filipinos fertig would become known simply as tatay father many of the emerging guerrilla forces at that time were simply bandit groups pretending to fight the japanese but really using the collapse of the americansupported government to set themselves up as rulers of local areas these groups competed with each other for territory and authority on  september  the leader of one strong group approached fertig hoping to use him as a front ie representing american military forces to assume authority over the entire island fertig consented but then used his knowledge of the filipino people and the current situation in mindanao to eventually take over the command of that group and then others recognizing that he needed a higher rank so he would be taken seriously by potential recruits to his struggle including the leaders of other existing guerrilla bands fertig promoted himself to brigadier general this selfpromotion to brigadier general did not endear him to general macarthur or his staff but macarthur did send logistical support to fertig throughout  and  organizing the resistanceedit japanese bombings destruction by retreating american troops deprivations by bandit guerrilla bands and hoarding by civilians had significantly reduced available war supplies as well as those items necessary to run an effective government fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped americans and resisting filipinos to create many supplies from scratch for example tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for  caliber rifles steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles money was printed in both english and the local language using wooden blocks and fisherman towed japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel often seemingly impossible problems were overcome simply through perseverance for example gerardo almendres a filipino high school student had sent away for an international correspondence schools course on radios shortly before the war started fertig assigned him the task of building a radio even though almendres had never handled one almendres was assisted by a filipino traveling salesman who had sold radios and by another filipino who once had listened to a radio radio parts vacuum tubes and other electrical parts were scrounged from old radio receivers and sound equipment from an old movie projector and other electrical devices their makeshift radio eventually worked and they began to receive transmissions from other radios including those of roy bell on negros who traveled to fertigs camp and devised a new aerial however they had no way of knowing if their own transmissions were successful until on  january  the us navy radio monitoring station in san francisco answered their call sign robert c ball william f konko and stewart willever jr became fertigs signal corps– this was an extremely important accomplishment as american military commands in the pacific had no idea that there was any effective armed resistance on mindanao or even in the philippines general charles willoughby macarthurs intelligence chief had assured him that there was no possibility of such the american command in the pacific first heard of fertig when the japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed major general fertig but the americans simply dismissed it as propaganda it took weeks before american intelligence was able to confirm who fertig was and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the japanese part of this investigative process involved mary fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husbands life mrs fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last american plane leaving mindanao a phrase in the letter pineapples for breakfast let mrs fertig know that her husband was alive and well on mindanao as that is where they spent short vacations and while there he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast the latest american intelligence had placed fertig on corregidor at the time of the surrender and so the us army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the japanese in february  with tenuous communication established general macarthur appointed fertig as commanding officer of the th military district on mindanao during the initial exchange of messages macarthur disallowed any promotion of american armed forces personnel in the philippines to general rank as a result fertig reduced himself in rank to colonel but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a filipino metalsmith due to the difficulty in communicating with fertig and his command because of the makeshift radio almendres had built a submarine loaded with military and medical supplies was eventually sent to mindanao arriving on  march  it also carried two americans who had known fertig in the philippines one was charles smith who on  december  had escaped with two other americans and two filipinos by sailing a small boat to australia perhaps at that time the longest openboat voyage since captain blighs smith was now a captain in us army intelligence the other was charles parsons formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in us navy intelligence in addition to his other prewar business interests in manila parsons had represented panama as its resident counsel when the japanese occupied manila parsons was careful to speak only spanish and convinced the japanese he was a citizen of panama as a result the japanese eventually sent parsons and his family on a long journey back to panama but when the swedish ship carrying them docked in new york and before he could report to us intelligence fbi agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked parsons who he was and quickly hustled him and his family ashore however another source states that parsons reported to us intelligence in the canal zone after the ship docked in panama it was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the german italian or other legations who knew parsons true citizenship status exposed his masquerade to the japanese their role as smith and parsons immediately explained to fertig was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and if so was it worth the risk of men and supplies to support him at the same time parsons and smith brought fertig some unpleasant orders from macarthurs headquarters the american army was willing to provide radios and other equipment for fertigs command but these were only to be used for passing information on japanese activities from coastwatchers and other sources to australia the guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the japanese fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support however due to the numerous atrocities that the japanese were committing against the philippine population the only way that fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning so as to provide the filipinos an outlet for revenge against the japanese fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the japanese then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with macarthurs headquarters and its directives in addition general charles a willoughby macarthurs chief of intelligence was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition was a waste of resources if a regular us army had been defeated by the japanese in the philippines then no irregular force could do better the guerrillas only purpose was to provide intelligence and later if fully equipped prior to the return of american forces to the philippines to fight as regular forces under the command of american officers fertig needed experienced american soldiers to train the filipino guerrillas the almost total lack of supplies was a serious problem but it was not the most pressing problem fertig faced at the time of the japanese invasion most philippine army units were of low quality they were not only poorly trained enough time not having passed to do so but they were underequipped and did not have the firepower to resist better armed japanese troops tanks and planes most of the soldiers were barefoot and many of their world war i era weapons lacked replacement parts and did not operate properly as a result many filipino units fled when attacked by the japanese this was symptomatic of fertigs most pressing need—experienced leaders he knew that eventually numerous leaders would emerge from the filipinos some guerrilla bands already had strong leaders but he needed them now his best resource for this leadership cadre was american servicemen who had either not surrendered or had escaped from prisonerofwar camps many were already fighting as guerrilla leaders or eager to so others joined him after he explained the need for their services but many others were not willing and demanded they be sent to australia where they could rejoin regular units fertigs reaction was not always one of understanding he told many that they would be returned when a means was found but that they would never be allowed to return others he removed from duty when it was apparent they did not have the leadership skills required eventually they were also returned to australia by submarine many with negative reports on their behavior some regular army personnel resented being commanded by a civilian turned soldier even if he had been in the philippines more years than they had many of the younger americans had disobeyed the orders to surrender due to their individualism others had used their cunning to evade the japanese or escape from the pow camps these traits sometimes led to clashes with the older men who had lived in the philippines for years and were now in command positions due to their reserve commissions or promotion by fertig as a result those who departed did not always report favorably on fertig once they reached macarthurs headquarters in australia those who stayed and fought received immediate commissions or were promoted if they already were officers in the us army although they might be sailors marines or even civilians macarthur eventually approved all of fertigs promotions even though advised not to do so by lt colonel courtney whitney his staff officer for filipino civilian affairs fighting the japaneseedit colonel fertig slowly assumed control over more of the existing rival guerrilla units on mindanao and turned them to harassing the japanese over the next two and a half years fertig created and commanded the mindanao segment of the united states forces in the philippines usfip recruiting escaped prisonersofwar and soldiers and american civilians who had refused to surrender however his real strength came from the thousands of patriotic filipinos many of whom were enraged by japanese atrocities who now joined existing or formed new organizations under his command the japanese were not unaware of these activities especially as they began to suffer losses in men and equipment and lose control of large areas between  and  usfip conducted numerous raids against the japanese occupation forces on mindanao in order to both sustain fertigs operation with captured supplies and to carry on harassing operations against the japanese this caused discord between fertig and macarthurs headquarters the american south west pacific area command wanted fertig to man coastwatcher units to report on japanese movements especially shipping as its main effort however to retain the loyalty of his forces in the wake of japanese atrocities fertig also had to wage an active campaign to kill japanese and their collaborators as well as disrupt activities aimed at civilians attacks against the japanese often initiated terrible reprisals by the japanese against local civilians so fertig issued orders that the guerrillas on mindanao were to avoid situations that would result in such reprisals however due to the japanese callousness toward the local populations reprisals often still occurred in addition to ambushing occupying japanese forces filipino guerrillas provided valuable intelligence reports to allied strategists initially fertigs forces were able to repel japanese attempts to recapture territory held by the guerrillas the japanese could not take any major actions against usfip on mindanao as not only were they dealing with other resistance movements in the philippines but most of their combat troops had been deployed to other areas of the pacific however in late spring  the japanese began military actions on a large scale on mindanao in those areas affected usfip forces had to retreat and give up land established camps and government infrastructure to the stronger japanese forces as the guerrilla units and government infrastructure fled before the japanese forces something occurred which fertig had hoped for he called it the pillow effect by providing no resistance to a stronger force the guerrillas survived the japanese blow when the japanese withdrew the pillow expanded to its original shape as the companysized guerrilla units dissolved the japanese began breaking up their units into smaller groups—eventually into squads—to track down these smaller units then without any orders from above first two or three guerrillas then  or more then platoon and then companysized units reorganized and struck back at the smaller japanese units causing the japanese heavy casualties in hundreds of small fire fights the japanese responded by reforming into battalionsized units that needed large towns to support them eventually the japanese using  to  troops on mindanao held the large towns on the sea coast while the usfip held the rest of the countryside or approximately  of the island of mindanao the guerrillas were so effective in some areas local japanese commanders made separate truces with them in exchange for the guerrillas not attacking japanese troops the japanese agreed to stay out of those areas in august  based upon favorable reports to macarthur by parsons and smith fertig was promoted to full colonel by macarthur and received the distinguished service cross for his efforts on  august fertig received the following message in recognition of your meritorious services as district commander and extraordinary heroism in action during the period of  may  to  august  i have awarded you the distinguished service cross announcement of your award is published in go hqs usaffe dtd  august i congratulate you on the distinguished service to your country and to the filipino people that has so well earned for you such recognition and hope that in it you will find inspiration for even greater future service quezon congratulates you on promotion fertig even created a navy by arming several small merchant vessels which he used to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine these vessels also attacked japanese shipping primarily small intercoastal vessels and patrol boats the usfip navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers homemade cannons and even mortars later some used  mm cannons supplied by the us navy one vessel was even armored using large circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large japanese steamer and another a sailing ship armed with  mm cannon fought off japanese aircraft and actually shot one down perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a japanese mitsubishi medium bomber more importantly the crew salvaged a new japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent it out on the next submarine to australia one of fertigs most audacious ship captains was waldo neveling a german civilian soldier of fortune and an enemy alien fertig had commissioned into the us army another ship called the bastard was actually a foot whaleboat captained by australian robert jock mclaren an escaped prisonerofwar from the sandakan pow camp on borneo mclaren would sail his boat into japanese controlled ports in broad daylight shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar then turn tail and run to help prepare for the eventual invasion of american forces fertig even had airstrips prepared and disguised one as long as  feet which took over a year to build the airstrips were built and then covered with topsoil and planted with crops all that was needed was a bulldozer to scrape off the topsoil and the airstrip would then be ready for planes some of these airstrips were later used by us marine corps squadrons to provide closeair support during the invasion early in  the japanese army once again launched a major effort in an attempt to destroy the guerrillas on mindanao although essentially a repeat of their previous failed efforts they came close to destroying the guerrillas not by eliminating them but by cutting off their sources of supplies this effort came to an abrupt end when the american army and navy launched their longawaited offensive against the philippines with a landing first on leyte and then on  april  on mindanao as the japanese army pulled its troops out of mindanao to defend other portions of the philippines american air and naval forces extracted a terrible toll on japanese shipping killing untold thousands of japanese troops when many of the survivors of the sinking ships swam ashore they found filipino guerrillas and civilians waiting for them on the beaches armed with bolos exhausted from the swim the japanese were unable to fight back against the terrible retribution the filipinos then extracted for the atrocities the japanese had perpetrated against them during the years of occupation the usfip also contributed heavily to coastwatching activities as requested by macarthurs headquarters fertigs coastwatchers provided information leading to the victories in the first battle of the philippine sea the great marianas turkey shoot and the battle of leyte gulf other intelligence gathered by fertigs guerrillas was so accurate aerial reconnaissance flights before attacks were often canceled so as not to warn the japanese the guerrillas often went to great risks to secure accurate information for example they would make pencilandpaper rubbings of the serial numbers on enemy artillery to prove the accuracy of their information however estimates of enemy strength in an area were sometimes unreliable as with the american forces now in the philippines the japanese were constantly moving their forces around to meet the threat lieutenant general robert eichelberger commanding the us eighth army often downplayed guerrilla intelligence but this was throughout the philippines as a whole for the th military district commanded by fertig he had this to say we did have considerable information about dispositions of enemy troop since guerrilla forces on mindanao were the most effective and best organized in the philippines but probably the best estimate of the value of guerrilla intelligence came from the japanese when they released an official communique stating that the americans had perfected a new aerial bomb which was attracted by concentrations of ammunition and fuel the bomb was simply accurate information on japanese installations supplied by the guerrillas as first american carrier planes then longdistance landbased planes began raids on the philippines the guerrillas became important for yet another reason as american pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by japanese antiaircraft fire they often found filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by filipinos in small swift boats often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships debriefing officers within a day or two fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing he knew they were more important flying missions against japanese targets besides colonel fertig now had a good supply of experienced battlehardened american and filipino leaders for his combat patrols the uss narwhal a submarine with a large cargo capacity made supply runs to the philippines from its humble beginnings usfip became one of the best equipped and most effective irregular units operating in world war ii when the submarine uss narwhal arrived at mindanao in nov  to deliver supplies the crew was met by a uniformed band playing stars and stripes forever although submarines had already delivered supplies to fertig and other guerrilla leaders the narwhals large size enabled it to deliver  tons of supplies at a time whereas other submarines could only deliver four tons or less this greatly increased the ability of the guerrilla forces not only to inflict damage to the enemy but also provide the necessary supplies to care for the medical health and wellbeing of the guerrilla forces and their civilian supporters in addition uss narwhal had the room to evacuate guerrillas needing critical medical care as well as american civilians primarily women and children who had been hiding out in the philippines and were suffering from malnutrition and diseases according to us navy records  of  resupply missions to the philippines were directed to mindanao between  january  and  january  for all of the philippines a total of  tons of supplies were landed with  people landed and another  evacuated filipino guerrillas secured airstrips for us planes on mindanao as an indicator of usfip strength on mindanao during january and february  in preparation for the return of regular american forces the guerrillas seized the dipolog airstrip in northern zamboanga and held it while surrounded by the japanese with the arrival of regular american forces in march  fertigs guerrilla forces participated in the battle of mindanao that effectively ended organized japanese resistance on that island they then disbanded on  september  the th infantry division of the philippine commonwealth army was reactivated and its ranks were heavily seeded with filipino veterans of the usfip at all levels of command american forces return to the philippines by late  fertig commanded a force estimated at between  and  effectives with most sources agreeing on —the equivalent of an army corps—with  of them armed officers with responsibility for corps command usually hold the rank of major general in addition fertig created and help administer the civilian government of mindanao while at the same time conducting the guerrilla war against the japanese the usfip killed at least  japanese soldiers and while a constant drain on japanese resources they also prevented the japanese from fully utilizing mindanaos resources in support of its war efforts at one time the japanese committed approximately  troops in an attempt to crush guerrilla resistance on mindanao troops that were desperately needed elsewhere throughout the entire philippines the guerrillas managed to tie down a japanese army of  troops of which approximately – were on mindanao depending on the time period after the war examination of japanese records indicated that the japanese high command felt that  battalions of troops would be needed to guard rear areas against guerrillas once the american invasion of the philippines began since seven divisions were slated to resist the invasion this resulted in a ratio of one reararea soldier to every three frontline troops ultimately the japanese concluded that it is impossible to fight the enemy and at the same time suppress the activities of the guerrillas while summarizing colonel wendell fertigs contributions to the american war effort and his leadership of the usfip on mindanao keats  states apart from his insistence on honesty and justice and the idea that the guerrilla army be a process of a responsible civil government his fundamental contribution to mindanao was his concern that the reward for performance should always be increased responsibility in his command demonstrated competence was the sole means to promotion and no man was denied an opportunity to prove himself this concept built a nation in north america and it built another on mindanao it was fertig more than any other man who gave the filipinos of mindanao increasing reason to believe in themselves this rather than a military victory was fertigs triumph the moro muslim datu pino sliced the ears off japanese and cashed them in with colonel fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and  centavos postwaredit some scholars question why fertig did not receive the medal of honor despite his considerable military achievements at great risk of his life others question why when fertig commanded so large an army of irregular guerrillas he was not promoted to brigadier general when other men who were never in combat received that rank as the us army grew in size william manchester in his  biography of macarthur american caesar offers the opinion that macarthur and his staff may have had their own agenda in minimizing the efforts of fertig other resistance leaders and the guerrillas themselves in liberating the philippines for example the american joint chiefs of staff authorized general macarthur to liberate the island of luzon but none of the other philippine islands after capturing luzon macarthur invaded numerous other islands without authorization and his actions were followed by a retroactive endorsement from the joint chiefs manchester stated he macarthur wanted to become the liberator of the philippines the japanese armys practice of referring to fertig as major general fertig commander in chief in the philippines throughout the occupation period and its use of japanese military notation in referring to the th military district as the  army group did not endear fertig to macarthurs headquarters manchester also relates that lieutenant colonel courtney whitney an ultraconservative manila corporation lawyer was assigned to macarthurs staff promoted and assigned responsibility for philippine civil affairs manchester wrote from the standpoint of the guerrillas he was a disastrous choice undiplomatic and belligerent he was condescending toward all filipinos except those who like himself had substantial investments in the philippines and by the time macarthur was ready to land on leyte whitney had converted most of the staff to reactionaryism at his urging the general macarthur barred oss agents from the southwest pacific because whitney suspected they would aid leftwing guerrillas by minimizing the efforts of the guerrilla movement in freeing the philippines whitney also robbed it of political clout after the war to make any substantial liberal changes in philippine government and society after the war in may  colonel fertig was awarded the us army distinguished service medal the citation reads in part constantly engaged with vastly superior enemy forces he engendered filipino faith and confidence in their ultimate deliverance instilled in them the will to resist and united them in the cause of freedom by his outstanding courage tireless determination and brilliant leadership colonel fertig made an inestimable contribution to the liberation of the philippine islands after the war fertig spent four years as the officerincharge of rotc at the colorado school of mines a surprisingly lowlevel post after such a distinguished war time career however when the korean war began he spent two years at the pentagon with a psychological warfare unit from july  to june  he was the special forces plans officer in the office of the chief of psychological warfare with headquarters us army then from june  to august  he served as deputy chief of psychological warfare it was during this time that he helped establish the armys psychological warfare center at fort bragg north carolina which later became the john f kennedy special warfare center and school due to his wartime experiences and postwar work fertig is one of three men who used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of sf special forces and is considered one of the founding fathers of the us army special forces colonel fertig was released from active duty in the mids fertig was widely regarded as a hero by the people of mindanao in june  wendell fertig and his wife returned to mindanao on a business trip as the interisland freighter pulled into cagayan the ships captain approached ferting and said sir i think friends await you as numerous small craft full of shouting men surrounded the ship wendell and mary fertig saw thousands of filipinos waiting at the waterfront at cagayan they had come from every corner of mindanao there were masses of women in the white uniforms of the womens auxiliary service and men wearing caps of the philippine veterans legion and the red fezzes of the moros the men were shouting and the women were singing they then saw a huge banner over the pier welcome the indomitable patriot who have lessened human suffering on mindanao wendell fertig ran a successful mining company in colorado until he died on  march  popular cultureedit a movie on wendell fertig has been in the planning stages for several
