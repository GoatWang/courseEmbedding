managementformer employee  business analyst in new york nyformer employee  business analyst in new york nydoesnt recommendnegative outlookapproves of ceoi worked at singleplatform fulltime less than a yearprosi really liked the people that were in my training class and i liked that we were able to stay together in the hunter zone it lead to some friendships that have maintained strong even with none of us working at sp anymoreconswalking into work everyday and putting on that headset to lie to customers about how they need to fix wrong information on public sites when in actuality we were lying to them in order to make the sale the next day made me feel extremely slimy not only were we expected to harass these small restaurants everyday but we were also told that this was the most important call that these owners were receiving all day because of that mentality we were told to be pushy aka overly rude and aggressive when we couldnt get the owners phone number or if the owner saw through the lienot only is the whole script a lie but also the doable numbers that we are expected to hit straight out of training are difficult to hit it leads to a very stressful environment towards the end of the month not only will you not get your commission check but there is a strong chance of you getting fired regardless of how many meetings you create or how your effort metrics look  dials  minutes of talk timewhenever i needed help with anything my manager was nowhere to be found when i finally was able to get a hold of her she was hardly ever that helpful and quite honestly made me feel like i was putting her out for asking a questionif you are looking to work for singleplatform i highly recommend thinking strongly about if you want to work at a call center also dont believe what the people interviewing you say i was not told about any of thisadvice to managementbe more transparent in the interview process actually listen and help your team esp for one month hunters who have no idea what to do stop with the email chains that belittle people who arent hitting their goals it doesnt make people want to work any harderchange the cold call to something that isnt a lie maybe actually tell them what it is that we do so that these owners dont get angry one day pitch should also be a thing because if you have an owner on the phone now the odds go down that they will pick up tomorrow especially when they know it is a sales pitchshare on facebookshare on twittershare on whatsappshare via emailcopy linklink copiedflag as inappropriateflag as

of ceoi have been working at singleplatform fulltime more than  yearsprosthe main reason anyone sticks around is for the money and the people there is really a great group of people that work here and they become your family and friendsconsto be quite frank the job really sucks after doing it for about three years or so it is really just the same thing day after day cold calling pitching new people the product and then trying to get there credit card they teach you to not hang up the phone and keep talking to these business owners in the hopes of convincing them that they need singleplatform which sometimes works and sometimes make these people really upset room for growth is very limited and the sales goals each month are pretty high a sale and a half a day to a sale a day gets pretty tough and stressful on when the end of the month comes and you are behind on goaladvice to managementprovide some job security to your employees they are always stressed out about losing there job and not being able to pay for rent the next month also be very transparent on why people leave and stop having the whole floor just gossip on why people quit or get fired we are all adults here the turn over rate is already so high and why not calm peoples nerves by letting them know whats going on instead of wonder also stop micro managing i get it you are trying to stay on top of people and trying to make the job fun but cold calling is never funfrom when i was in the hunter zone it used to be so much fun and now its just like  ugh i would hate to be a new hire its like they are trying way to hard also if you are going to make sure full cycle reps are hitting there effort metrics you should also make sure your closers are hitting them too i mean i am a closer i never hit them oops maybe give them some incentive to keep their hunters cause right now i have the opportunity to be lazy because no one is watching me sorta say trust your employees and let them breathe every once in a

sales representativerecommendspositive outlookapproves of ceoi have been working at singleplatform fulltime less than a yearprosi feel that this review is long overdue but something that i have felt compelled to write for a very long timeso here it goesi am a current employee of singleplaform before arriving here i came from the grime of bohemia—spending my first two years out of college sleeping on couches instead of paying rent performing in dingy spaces across the city doing odd crappy jobs—just suffering for the art because “yolo” righti came to singleplatform because i was desperate for stability and knew that sales were an analogous skillset to my theatre background and frankly a sound alternative to performing in the bowls of new york city dungeonsi believe i was the antithesis of their employable prototype i was a little older than the mean age of staff there i had no business background whatsoever i also had limited experience in sales…so it was a true leap for me i remember walking in there and seeing greek lettering stapled to the wall state school swag splashed across the desks in collegiate obeisance the “bro” species suited up with headsets and exploding with alphaconfidence the only thing i could think of was “omg how will i ever fit in here”however in the ephemeral words of elle woods first impressions aren’t everythingneedless to say different as i was—the tortured artist with chips on her shoulder in six different places—i was welcomed to this company with open arms  months into my employment i can say with confidence these people are some of the most supportive and lovely humans i have come across in a very long time words cannot fully impart the tremendous gratitude i have for the people reps and management alike i struggled so much the past few months well years but that’s a different story i went through several hospitalizations while at sp some truly nasty personal drama and more pertinently i was well still am rather mediocre at the job however for all the tornados and tempests that i am management stood by me the entire time helping me both personally and professionally every time a spattered into a puddle of stress and selfdoubt they’d take me to their office and ask me genuinely and kindly “how can i help you succeed” they ask this not because they have to it’s because they want you to get better be stronger they care just as much for helping small business as they do for their employees and i’m certain that this is true the singleplatform company for all its ups and downs is embedded with the human element they’re not a group of sterile people not machines at a desk spitting numbers by rote all day long these guys are filled with both humor and grace that alone is worth coming to every morning at am and cold calling some smbsconsbefore anyone applies you should know for most of you this will be a difficult job because it’s sales and that’s the name of the game you will get rejected  times told insane things on the phone may even say insane things back though i advise keep yourself together and be classy some of you might want to quit after the first month because let’s be real cold calling is a hard knock lyfe stick with it if you can i can assure you though whether you want to go into sales as your career or you have that entrepreneurial spirit or whether you just want to boost you eq emotion intelligence trust me in any business venture you need it inside sales at sp is a terrific foundation and you need to master the cold call it’s essential for every business transaction you will make in your life trust it trust the process trust the management they’re fantasticalso the culture is exceptionally lax here which is great for me because i don’t think my rainbow personality could be confined in a pencil skirt and heels however don’t let it deceive you be mindful i’ve learned the hard way because i’m a performer and grabbing attention to make people laugh is my strawberry jam but it’s still an office don’t be an idiotone more thing if you are like me juggling other ventures or just have a very robust after work life this job is not the easiest to juggle with it really requires you to be on and focused all the time i spend a lot of sleepless nights finishing up my projects and sometimes come into work tired and grumpy it can be done i do it but i dont recommend it so unless youre a nut like me try and just focus on the job its the only way to get betteradvice to managementgradie oakes matt deis chelsea luther meg riley josh glantz and now ben rosenkeep being
