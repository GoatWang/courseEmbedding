by  aecom says prior to the engagement there was no feasibility assessment roadmap or implementation plan for the airport to achieve these targets aecom evaluated the energyconservation measures ecms a mix of retrocommissioning operational enhancements equipment improvements and lighting upgrades and the associated energy and ghg impacts and developed strategies and scenarios for achieving the targets aecom was able to understand the operational impact of absolute vs intensitybased energy and ghg metrics and reduction targets which are important considerations given the projected growth of airport activity and determine the required mix of short medium and longterm ecms that would be needed for the airport to achieve the targets san diego international airport sustainability management plan smp aecom will review the authority’s existing sustainability plans and conduct a baseline assessment in five sustainability program elements  air quality and greenhouse gas ghg emissions climate resilience waste management and recycling clean transportation and biodiversity – then develop performance targets implementation strategies and a monitoring framework the final deliverables will be strategic action plans for each sustainability element and an overall sustainability management plan that will inform ongoing operations and communicate the airport’s sustainability approach to the public following this engagement the authority will have sustainability actionimplementation plans for  of the  primary sustainability focus areas  air qualityghg including support for ongoing airport carbon accreditation clean transportation including targets for reducing emissions from all ground transportation sources climate resilience including adaptation measures for flood resilience extreme heat and drought preparedness zero waste including analysis of waste streams and recycling infrastructure with targets for improving waste diversion and pursuing zero waste and biodiversity including strategies to ensure airport operations are compatible with local wildlife once a baseline is fully established aecom will develop reduction targets with the airport and develop an implementation plan and managementmonitoring tools to achieve the reduction targets sustainable brands recently spoke with craig riley practice group leader for aecom’s corporate advisory  sustainability services to learn more about sustainability within the field what can you tell us about the state of sustainability in the infrastructure industry craig riley making sustainability practices a core business driver has been a corporate and communal imperative for several years now increasingly organizations are finding that aligning core business strategies with the principles of sustainability can differentiate them in the marketplace companies that integrate sustainable solutions have gone beyond traditional efficiency projects like energy cost savings and found ways to integrate sustainability efforts into core aspects of their organization like connecting corporateenterpriselevel strategy with data management and performance at the facility or department level reinvigorating an existing sustainability program by aligning with the sustainable development goals identifying cleaner ‘greener’ input materials and finding innovative uses of waste to name a few the opportunities for companies in sustainability are broad – offering results that range from cost savings and operational excellence to innovation and reinvention of products and services isnt it equally important to fix crumbling infrastructure as to invest in new building riley from a sustainability perspective – that is embodied carbon or energy for example – i believe it is actually more important to fix crumbling infrastructure than to invest in new buildings however in many cases new buildingsinfrastructure are required for safety efficiency or many other reasons so every case needs to be looked at individually the decision of whether new construction is needed or whether use of existing infrastructure is sufficient should be made from a life cycle perspective what are the best ways to incentivize ceos beyond money to make sustainability a core value riley the most successful sustainability programs and cultures have commitment and involvement or tone” from the top and participation through every level of the organization having this emphasis on sustainability – both in a discrete manner through programs and policies and indirectly through awareness around sustainability topics  will help push the focus on sustainability past monetary incentives but it starts with a deliberate effort to integrate and instill sustainability as a value ceos are driven by more than just financial considerations or at the least consider a broader definition of financial concerns beyond the immediate short term as such the more sustainability is thought of and managed in terms of addressing risk supporting growth of the business and providing return on capital the easier it will be to develop formal and informal incentives around the advancement of sustainability for the organization ceos are more likely to support a sustainability strategy that is aligned to multiple departments ie hr operations procurement etc and geographies where applicable and along multiple dimensions beyond financial what will sustainability look like in fiveten years riley in  years i see sustainability as a much deeper business management topic  where organizations will be managing
