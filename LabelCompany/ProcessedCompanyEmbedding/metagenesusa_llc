half  half labeled under the brand name wholesome country creamery due to the presence of alkaline phosphatase found in samples during routine testing naturally wholesome products llc has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of cautionall gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of  or  distribution of the affected product was limited in scope no other naturally wholesome products llc products are affected by this recallthe company initiated this voluntary recall because in routine testing samples of the affected product were found to contain alkaline phosphatase an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized the north carolina department of agriculture and consumer services during a followup investigation of the plant identified  batches of half  half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the pasteurized milk ordinancethe recall involves  units of the affected product which was distributed only in north carolina the company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected producthow to identify the recalled productthis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of half  half that carry the wholesome country creamery brand name the containers have a small white sticker reading  or no other naturally wholesome products llc products are included in this recallnaturally wholesome products llc has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway consumers who have this product should not consume it they should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange consumers with questions can contact the company at  because the presence of alkaline phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with including salmonella campylobacter listeria andor e coli have survived and if ingested could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications  follow

solution to help control her   pound german shepherdalaskan husky named ziggy “i went to the dollar store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen” said silva  “i was pleasantly surprised when it worked so i had a sturdier one made that my dog ziggy loved  he walked by my side and i never had to put any pressure on the new leash” like
