put ur in awkward spot by karin kapsidelis richmond timesdispatch feb   … receive daily news emails sent directly to your email inboxsubscribe today paul b queally a major benefactor and trustee of the university of richmond has been caught on tape making sexist and homophobic jokes that are putting his alma mater in an awkward spotpaul queally — whose name is on a squarefoot addition to the robins school of business and will be on a new gateway building for the campus — is quoted in a new york magazine article as telling the jokes two years ago during the induction ceremony for a secret wall street fraternity called kappa beta phiqueally did not return a call seeking comment but he emailed a statement through a representative wednesday that said the jokes do not reflect his views or values and that “on reflection” he should not have made themthe article by kevin roose titled “onepercent jokes and plutocrats in drag what i saw when i crashed a wall street secret society” describes queally’s exchange with another privateequity executive during a skit that was surreptitiously recorded at the blacktie eventaccording to roose’s article queally made the jokes about hillary clinton and barney frank a now retired openly gay member of congress as part of a skit involving new kappa beta phi inductees who were dressed in leotards and goldsequined skirts and wigsthe article with accompanying audio touched a nerve at ur which has an administrator specifically to oversee programs related to sexual diversity and to support the lgbtq communityin his statement queally said the event was “a private function where all participants were expected to dress in costume and make silly outrageous comments writers were engaged”the statement added “my brief remarks were in the spirit of the event but they do not reflect my views or my values on reflection i should have said nothing i understand that people who do not know me or my work may misinterpret what i said i believe my record in support of education diversity and economic advancement defines who i am and what i stand for”queally copresident of the welsh carson anderson  stowe investment firm is a  ur alumnus with his wife annemarie also a ur graduate he has given the university nearly  million their recent donation of  million will help finance a center for admission and career services that will serve as the new gateway to campusat ur some are now questioning whether queally’s name should be on the welcome center said peter kaufman a professor in the jepson school of leadership studies“it would be a shame to see his name closely associated with the first thing prospective students see when they come to the university” kaufman saidasked for reaction the university released a statement from rector charles a ledsinger jr that said the board “reaffirms the commitment of each of its members to promoting opportunity inclusivity civility and respect”in his new york magazine piece roose writes that he slipped into the january  event at the st regis hotel in new york as part of research for his newly published book “young money”before he was discovered and ejected he observed some of the world’s top investors dining on rack of lamb and foie gras and hearing the legend of kappa beta phi a secret fraternity founded at the beginning of the great depression “as a sort of onepercenter’s friars club” roose writeshe quotes the fraternity’s leader billionaire investor wilbur ross as telling the new initiates that the group was started in  by “four c william and mary students” its crest depicts a “macho right hand in a proper savile row suit and a turnbull and asser shirtsleeve”roose quotes ross as saying the crest was superior to that of its namesake phi beta kappa whose ruffledsleeve logo ross called a “tacit confession of homosexuality” phi beta kappa – actually founded by five college of william and mary students in   is not the only reference to virginia higher education in the articleamong those named as members of kappa beta phi is paul tudor jones the university of virginia alumnus whose comments at a uva symposium last year were denounced as sexist by some faculty membersjones’ remark that women lose interest in their finance careers when they have babies was officially disavowed by the universitythe year before jones was embroiled in uva’s leadership crisis when he backed the board in its unsuccessful attempt to fire the president — prompting debate over how much influence a major donor might have in a university’s directionon a different level that

fewer regulations easier immigration policies for skilled workers and more education in science technology and math — that seemed to be the overarching remedy for the economy and a wish list for the trump administration from a panel of three investment and finance professionals and one tech industry businessman who spoke at the university of richmond this weekthe semiannual “word on wall street” forum hosted by ur’s robins school of business on wednesday drew about  students businesspeople and other gueststhe panel discussion focused on how president donald trump’s decisions and policies may affect the national and global economies but the conversation ranged much more broadly to include such issues as workforce preparednessa socalled “trump bump” that sparked stock markets on the prospect of lower taxes and fewer regulations seems to be cooling off now as the reality of the political situation in washington sets in the panelists saidpaul queally the moderator of the panel and copresident of investment firm welsh carson anderson  stowe gave a somewhat grim summation of the current economic fundamentals citing slowing productivity sluggish gross domestic product underfunded pensions and a concentration of wealth“the big picture in the economy is we spend more than we collect and we have been doing it for an awfully long time and it does not look like that is abating” queally said“another big picture is that growth continues to slow” he said referring to gdp growth that seems to be stuck in a torpid growth pattern slower than most of the past  years despite a low inflation environmentqueally and other panelists including alan breed president and portfolio manager of edgewood management and herbert mcdade iii managing partner of river birch capital put much of the blame on federal regulatory burdens which they said have only expanded for decades“it is a significant burden but more than that it is a significant deterrent to starting businesses” breed said “i think there is hope that president trump will roll some of this back”immigration policy was a key issue emphasized by panelist michael walrath a university of richmond graduate and cofounder of several successful tech ventures including right media and moat walrath said that despite trump’s antiimmigration rhetoric innovative companies need to be able to recruit talented people from all over the world when it comes to technology “immigration is not part of the problem it is part of the solution” he saida tech company of  employees may have three foreign workers who are “absolutely essential for the mission of that company” and their work supports  other jobs he saidthe panelists seemed to agree that a lack of workforce preparedness in such fields as science and technology is exacerbating what queally described as a growing concentration of wealth among a smaller percentage of the population“unfortunately our students in america lack stem science technology engineering and math skills” queally said “the top  percent seems almost unstoppable more and more wealth is getting concentrated in the hands of the few as it is a knowledge economy” jblackwelltimesdispatchcom
