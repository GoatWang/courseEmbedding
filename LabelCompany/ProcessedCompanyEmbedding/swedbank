profilesonja luoma  april 3 earlier this year swedbank began to include capitalatrisk products in their product offerings for the mass market in sweden nicole pluntke pictured global head of structured products at swedbank shares some thoughts with srp about the banks new product strategy what are the reasons behind swedbanks decision to include capitalatrisk structures in its offering for the mass market we are always very focused on finding the best investment solutions for our clients and we see that this structure is a good instrument in a well diversified portfolio for swedbanks clients we have very close cooperation and dialogue with our investment centre with the goal of jointly presenting a broad and attractive savings offering to our clients where structured products are a natural part of our proposition we have always had an extremely high focus on our clients and in finding the best solutions for them do capitalatrisk products have traction among retail investors are sales volumes as expected over expectation or below expectation how are you expecting sales for these to develop over the coming year we see a good demand for noncapital guaranteed products ncgp as well as for capital guaranteed structures last month ncgp was the segment with the highest issued volume however investors should look at their whole portfolio and ensure that they have a good diversification of their savings as i said we are working closely with swedbanks investment centre as well as our economists to find the best possible saving solutions for our clients last year was a great year for structured products at swedbank and we issued bigger volumes compared to  we have continued to see great demand for structured products from our clients during the first part of 3 and our goals for structured products at swedbank are to have the best client savings offering in the market and to be the natural choice for swedish clients are there any particular payoff structures that swedbank is using in its capitalatrisk range will you be offering a variety of structures or rather stick to a specific type we will limit the number of structures we offer to our retail clients but still we plan to add a couple of different types to our current offering protected trackersenhanced trackers it is of the utmost importance that the adviser and the client understand how the structure works is there a risk that these will be eating sales volume from your capitalprotected offerings no not really when building a well diversified portfolio you need different products so we see that there is a need for the capitalprotected offering as well as for the ncgp a recent poll among swedish providers on our website unveiled that the majority of providers think that capitalprotected products will see the main increase in sales this year how does this reflect on your strategy for your capitalatrisk offeringsswedbanks market share for capitalprotected products in the swedish market is around onethird of the total volume and we think that this area will still be an important part of what we offer to our clients however we want to offer them a broader range of products and that is the reason why we now are offering the ncgp along with our capitalprotected productsswedbank is one of the main retail banks in sweden but the bank also has home markets in the baltics last year the bank had the third largest market share in sweden excluding products in the flow and others sectionthe first capitalatrisk product launched by swedbank in sweden
