present invention is generally in the field of genetically engineered bacterial and plant systems for production of polyhydroxyalkanoates by microorganisms and genetically engineered plants wherein the enzymes essential for production of the polymers are expressed as fusion proteins having enhanced properties for polymer synthesis  numerous microorganisms have the ability to accumulate intracellular reserves of polyrhydroxyalkanoate polymers or phas phas are biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic materials with a broad range of industrial and biomedical applications williams and peoples  chemtech   in recent years the pha biopolymers have emerged from what was originally considered to be a single homopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate phb into a broad class of polyesters with different monomer compositions and a wide range of physical properties over  different monomers have been incorporated into the pha polymers steinbüchel and valentin  fems microbiol lett   it has been useful to divide the phas into two groups according to the length of their side chains and their biosynthetic pathways those with short side chains such as polyhydroxybutyrate phb a homopolymer of rhydroxybutyric acid units are semicrystalline thermoplastics whereas phas with long side chains are more elastomeric  biosynthesis of the short sidechain phas such as phb and phbv proceeds through a sequence of three enzyme catalyzed reactions from the central metabolite acetylcoa in the first step of this pathway two acetylcoa molecules are condensed to acetoacetylcoa by a ketoacylcoa thiolase acetoacetylcoa is subsequently reduced to the phb precursor hydroxybutyrylcoa by an nadph dependent reductase hydroxybutyrylcoa is then polymerized to phb which is sequestered by the bacteria as “intracellular inclusion bodies” or granules the molecular weight of phb is generally in the order of  da in some bacteria such as chromatium vinosum the reductase enzyme is active primarily with nadh as cofactor the synthesis of the phbv copolymer proceeds through the same pathway with the difference being that acetylcoa and propionylcoa are converted to ketovalerylcoa by βketothiolase ketovalerylcoa is then converted to hydroxyvalerylcoa which is polymerized  long side chain phas are produced from intermediates of fatty acid βoxidation or fatty acid biosynthesis pathways in the case of βoxidation the lisomer of βhydroxyacylcoa is converted to the disomer by an epimerase activity present on the multienzyme complex encoded by the faoab genes biosynthesis from acetylcoa through the fatty acid synthase route produces the lisomer of βhydroxyacylacp conversion of the acp to the coa derivative is catalyzed by the product of the phag gene kruger and steinbuchel  us pat no   enoylcoa hydratases have been implicated in pha biosynthesis in microbes such as rhodospirillum rubrum and aeromonas caviae the biosynthesis of phb in r rubrum is believed to proceed through an acetoacetylcoa reductase enzyme specific for the lisomer of hydroxybutyrylcoa conversion of the l to the d form is then catalysed by the action of two enoylcoa hydratase activities in the case of the phbcohx where x is a cc hydroxy acid copolymers which are usually produced from cells grown on fatty acids a combination of these routes can be responsible for the formation of the different monomeric units indeed analysis of the dna locus encoding the pha synthase gene in aeromonas caviae which produces the copolymer phbcohydroxyhexanoate identified a gene encoding a dspecific enoylcoa hydratase

subunit encoding a pha synthase from a microorganism into plant cells and obtain the appropriate level of production of the pha synthase enzyme in addition it may be necessary to provide additional pha biosynthetic genes eg a ketoacylcoa thiolase an acetoacetylcoa reductase gene a hydroxybutyrylcoa transferase gene or other genes encoding enzymes required to synthesize the substrates for the pha synthase enzymes  in many cases it is particularly desirable to control the expression in different plant tissues or organelles methods for controlling expression are known to those skilled in the art

example the phbc phba and phbb genes of r eutropha  genetic engineering of bacteria and plants to make products such as polymers which require the coordinated expression and action of multiple enzymes sequentially on different substrates may result in low yields or poor efficiencies or variations or deviation in the final product  it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide methods and materials for enhancing production of products of multiple enzymes such as polymers and particularly polyhydroxyalkanoates in bacteria or plants summary of the invention  in order to optimize the flux or flow of carbon intermediates from normal cellular metabolism into phas it is desirable to optimize the expression of the enzymes of the pha biosynthetic pathway gene fusions are genetic constructs where two open reading frames have been fused into one the transcriptional and translational sequences upstream of the first open reading frame direct the synthesis of a single protein with the primary structure that comprises both original open reading frames consequently gene fusions encode hybrid proteins and in some cases bifunctional hybrid enzymes individual genes are isolated for example by pcr such that the resulting dna fragments contain the complete coding region or parts of the coding region of interest the dna fragment that encodes the aminoterminal domain of the hybrid protein may contain a translation initiation site and a transcriptional control sequence the stop codon in the gene encoding the aminoterminal domain needs to be removed from this dna fragment the stop codon in the gene encoding the carboxyterminal domain needs to be retained in the dna fragment dna sequences that are recognized by restriction enzymes may be introduced into the new genes for dna cloning purposes linkers may be added to spatially separate the two domains of the hybrid protein  in the case of enzymes which catalyse successive reactions in a pathway the fusion of two genes results in bringing two enzymatic activities into close proximity to each other when the product of the first reaction is a substrate for the second one this new configuration of active sites may result in a faster transfer of the product of the first reaction to the second active site with a potential for increasing the flux through the pathway the configuration of the two catalytic domains in the hybrid in relation to one another may be altered by providing a linker sequence between them this linker may be composed of any of the twenty natural amino acids and can be of variable length the variation in length and composition are important parameters for changing the relative configuration of the individual domains of the hybrid and its enzyme activities  this technology allows for the direct incorporation of a series of genes encoding a multienzyme pathway into a bacteria or plant or plant organelle for example the plastid genome in some cases it may be useful to

after confirmation of the dna sequence of the insert phbb was cloned as a bamhixbai fragment from ptrcbl into bamhixbai digested ptrcaf resulting in plasmid ptrcab the resulting hybrid gene encodes

results in a glycineserine linker that connects the thiolase and the reductase enzyme and which could be subsequently modified to alter the length andor sequence of the linker region several such
