range acoustic hailing devices request a quote support fact sheet lrad corporation is using longrange communication to safely hail and warn inform and direct prevent misunderstandings determine intent establish large safety zones resolve uncertain situations and save lives on both sides of its proprietary long range acoustic device® lrad® unlike bullhorns vehicle pa systems and conventional loudspeakers that disperse sound in all directions lrad’s proprietary audio technology focuses sound in a ° – ° beam in front of its long range acoustic devices while significantly reducing audio levels behind the devices and in surrounding areas lrad broadcasts are safely optimized to the primary human hearing range of  –  khz to generate voice messages that are clearly heard and understood from close range to over  meters lrad systems broadcast live or recorded voice messages with exceptional clarity in any operational scenario lrad’s advanced driver and waveguide technology ensures every voice and warning siren broadcast cuts through crowd engine and background noise and is clearly heard and understood even inside buildings and vehicles in uncertain or escalated public safety situations lrad fills the critical gap between the limited range and poor intelligibility of bullhorns and vehicle pa systems and kinetic measures including tear gas projectiles rubber bullets pepper balls tasers and flash bang grenades lrad is not a weapon lrad is a highly intelligible longrange communication system and a safer alternative to kinetic force lrad’s omnidirectional one voice® systems combine warning sirens and highly intelligible voice broadcasts to provide advanced mass notification and public address solutions antiquated warning systems sound sirens to alert of approaching danger but most are incapable of clear voice broadcasts containing critical information about the severity of the situation and recommended actions to protect and save lives lrad mass notification systems are also used to communicate to crowds during large outdoor events and to affected populations throughout emergency situations lrad systems are selfcontained or easily integrated with existing communications infrastructure lrad broadcasts follow the inverse square law which teaches that for every doubling of the distance from the sound source sound intensity diminishes by  decibels like all loudspeakers lrad’s audio output is measured in decibels at a distance of  meter in front of the device according to the american academy of audiology ambulance and fire engine sirens measure over  decibels and custom car stereos measure  decibels lrad warning sirens are safe and very effective in gaining attention to the voice messages that follow contrary to erroneous reports lrad is incapable of generating very low frequencies and does not cause nausea or disorientation lrad systems are safe rugged reliable easy to operate and can be temporarily or permanently mounted lrad corporation maintains a strict policy of selling lrad systems only to qualified government agencies and commercial security entities operators are trained in the device’s operation and use before deployment by maintaining a smooth frequency response with an intensity variation of less than db lrad has eliminated the shortcomings of competitor systems by preventing audio fading and producing clear unambiguous communication across all broadcast frequencies each lrad model is the loudest most intelligible product in its size and weight category additionally lrad features a portable capability in a rugged lightweight waterproof casing as well as wireless capability and the option to operate the device remotely across an ipaccessible network lrad provides communication solutions to meet any operational requirement how lrad is deployed in public law enforcement and defense applications step  – operator broadcasts directionsinstructions in a loud clear voice lrad broadcasts are highly effective in communicating clearly over distance and background noise to individuals small groups and large crowds prerecorded messages can be broadcast in multiple languages clearly and effectively hailing and warning in an authoritative highly intelligible voice provides clearly heard and understood instructions and direction step  – if direction is not taken operator then broadcasts a more authoritative message deployment of lrad at increased volume levels can safely influence behavior and create safety zones while preventing the need for the escalation of force eof stand down or move to more aggressive stance step  – if directionsinstructions are not taken operator employs the lrad warning tone lrad safely creates increased standoff and safety zones supports resolution of uncertain situations and alleviates the use of harmful or deadly force lrad is equipped with a volume control knob unlike tear gas tasers rubber bullets pepper spray and other nonlethal and lethal responses lrad is safe and easily modulated step  – after employing the above steps if individuals or crowds persist in unlawful actions operators are assured they provided clearly heard and understood commands to cease and desist before initiating eof lrad advantages performance – longest range clearest communication reliable and demonstrated safe operation flexibility – scalable portable and available in several mounting configurations including an ipaddressable option design – overcomes background noise to further increase the communication range in any type of terrain and environment controls – simple to operate allowing immediate response and process initiation single operator use reduces manpower while increasing security coverage escalation of force – much safer alternative to nonlethal deterrents when initiating the eof safety – creates increased standoff distances to enhance the safety of the public while providing peacekeeping personnel more time to assess and respond appropriately to public safety situations lrad systems clearly effectively and safely communicate over distance create large standoff zones prevent misunderstandings determine intent
