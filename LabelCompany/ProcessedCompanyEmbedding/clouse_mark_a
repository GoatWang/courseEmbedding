strategy our management team our corporate timelines our founders compliance and integrity our founders thomas adams sr thomas adams sr  – founder of modern chewing gum the birth of the modern day chewing gum industry can be traced to the s when thomas adams sr a new york wholesale glass merchant and inventor became acquainted with general antonio lópez de santa anna president of mexico when santa anna was exiled from mexico and came to the us in the mids he stayed with friend adams at his staten island home santa anna suggested to adams that he create a formula to make carriage or bicycle tires by experimenting with chicle a substance found in central american sapodilla fruit trees about one ton of chicle from mexico was shipped to new york and adams assisted by his son thomas jr tried unsuccessfully to use chicle as a rubber substitute for tires and other items the supply of chicle sat in a warehouse until adams was inspired by a girl asking for chewing gum in a new york drugstore he came up with the idea to use the chicle to make chewing gum until this time chewing gum was made with spruce tree resin or paraffin wax in about  adams and his son started making unflavored and unsweetened chicle chewing gum in the kitchen of their home first rolling the chicle flat with a rolling pin and then cutting it into pieces with scissors they boxed and labeled the product “adams’ new york chewing gum no  – snapping and stretching” thomas jr took boxes of their new chewing gum and left them on consignment at drug stores their chicle gum was a success with consumers and soon reorders poured in in  adams registered us patent  for a method of preparing “chickly” chicle to produce chewing gum and began commercial mass production of the confectionery product with two of his sons thomas jr and john d thomas adams sr started adams  sons company in  the firm was the world’s most prosperous chewing gum company by the end of the century thomas jr became president of the company when thomas sr retired in  thomas jr then built a gum powerhouse in  by merging with the six largest and bestknown chewing gum manufacturers in the united states and canada and achieved great success as the maker of chiclets thomas adams sr died in  at the age of  john cadbury john cadbury  john cadbury was born in birmingham england on th august  he was from a quaker family and did not have the option to go to university as this was against quaker beliefs instead he became an apprentice to a tea dealer in leeds in  he opened a grocer’s shop at  bull street birmingham in  selling amongst other things cocoa and drinking chocolate which he prepared himself using a mortar and pestle tea coffee cocoa and drinking chocolate were seen as healthy alternatives to alcohol which as a quaker he believed was bad for society after several years john decided to start manufacturing on a commercial scale in  he purchased a warehouse in nearby crooked lane the earliest preserved price list from  shows that he was selling  lines of drinking chocolate in cakes and powder format and eleven lines of cocoa in powder flakes paste and cocoa nibs formats he was only selling one line of eating chocolate at this time in  john took his brother benjamin into partnership and the name of the firm was changed to cadbury brothers in  the business moved to a new factory in bridge street  the partnership with benjamin was dissolved by mutual consent in  and john retired in  handing over complete control of the business to his two sons richard and george the following decades saw the cadbury business grow to become an industry leader by harnessing the opportunities of industrialisation and creatively marketing to a growing consumer class john cadbury spent his retirement engaged in civic and social work in birmingham philanthropy had been important to him all his life over the years he had led a campaign to ban the use of boys as chimney sweeps
