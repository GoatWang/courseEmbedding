article imagine that you have a good idea perhaps even a great idea for a product that might help humanityand of course make some money along the way so you start your company and a few years later raise hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock to the public years go by and the value of your stock swells and deflates depending on news of your progress then one disastrous day your idea goes up in smoke maybe it wasnt ever workable maybe the timing was off maybe you got something a little wrong for whatever reason you never actually produce a widget you never make a sale in most businesses what happens next is simple you go broke after all no product no profit unless you worked in the brave new world of biotechnology then you could walk away a millionaire it happened in

pm colorado rockies vs miami marlins tickets mon sep  pm colorado rockies vs los angeles dodgers tickets fri sep  pm late last year after nearly fifteen years in business synergen inc ceased to exist the value of its publicly traded stock had plummeted following the failure of a medication the company hoped would combat deadly infections in november synergens directors voted to sell to amgen inc the largest biotech company in the world despite synergens spectacular disintegration its executives emerged unscathed heres how welltimed stock sales many top executives had the foresight to sell large blocks of stock when synergen was trading at its peak making them instant millionaires repriced stock options in august  just after the company laid off  percent of its workforce synergens board of directors voted to lower the purchase price of stock options available to company employees this controversial courtesywhich the board had granted its executives on other occasionswas not extended to public stockholders who simply lost money when synergens stock dropped but it was particularly helpful to the companys executives who held tens of thousands of stock options from their salary packages and bonuses a golden parachute thanks to some lastminute maneuvering in the companys final monthsincluding new contracts written just weeks before it was sold to amgensynergens top officers left with a severance package that started with three years salary for the companys toppaid executive ceo greg abbott that provision alone called for a goodbye check worth three quarters of a million dollars synergen associates was founded in january  by four university of colorado scientists who planned to research and develop various geneticengineering techniques according to state records the company was incorporated as synergen inc in  biotechnologythe business of cloning the bodys own proteins and then using them to fight diseasesis not for the faint of heart it is a long bumpy and ultimately uncertain road from a good idea to a product it can take hundreds of millions of dollars and more than a decade of lab work just to lay the necessary groundwork which is why synergen didnt really begin to take off until relatively recently in its early years synergen teamed up with other biotech companies to do basic research and completed some small projects for commercial ventures including coors along the way two of the original founders larry gold and marvin caruthers departed to pursue other research a third david hirsh left the companys daytoday operations several years ago today he teaches at columbia university larry soll stayed in  synergen launched human trials for its most promising product a drug called antril the company touted antril as a treatment for sepsis a deadly spread of bacteria resulting from infection sepsis affects a halfmillion people every year in this country alone nearly half of them die from it though tragic in human terms such large numbers are encouraging news to investors and optimistic biotech companies sepsis is an enormously complex condition and several recent attempts to develop drugs to treat it all ended in failure this is hardly unusual industry analysts estimate that only one fifth of the proposed products that make it to human clinical trials eventually get approved by the food and drug administration but in the business of biotechnology a company need never produce anything in order for people to buy in because of the simple potential to earn huge profits investors are willing to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into research that is oddson to fail thats what happened with synergen and antril given the large potential market and antrils promising early results synergen quickly became a hot property by the end of  its stock was selling at a  percent gain in value over two years in  the company raised more money funds necessary to shepherd antril through the clinicaltesting and governmentregulation processes the public offering was successful and synergen soon had a  million bank account built on the promise of antril   that same year the company moved the drug into phase ii clinical trials while phase i trials are meant to show a drug is safe phase ii tests aim to prove it has some sort of positive effect on patients phase iii tests the final stage before fda approval are designed to confirm phase ii results with more patients by the end of  synergens stock was burning up wall street shares closed the year selling at  four times their price just a year before the heady environment was enough to make executives cocky when one analyst criticized the company according to an anecdote quoted in business week cofounder and chairman larry soll mailed him a tin of shinola shoe polish and a pile of plastic dog shit an accompanying note suggested the analyst couldnt tell the difference despite what seemed to be the impending inevitable success of antriland thus synergenseveral executives apparently decided to make hay while the market suns were shining they sold stocklots of it and as luck would have it they redeemed their shares at the exact moment synergens stock was trading at its highest value for example according to securities and exchange commission documents in january  michael catalano who at the time directed clinical research unloaded  shares at  and collected  four days later cofounder hirsh sold  of his synergen shares at  for a take of  million a day after that jon saxe then the companys president let go of  of his shares at  each raking in  million in the process and during the first week of january  soll himself sold a total of  synergen shares according to sec filings they fetched prices of anywhere between  and  solls total take nearly  million the company continued surging throughout that year in september  synergen opened a  million proteinproduction plant in boulder the sparkling new facility was designed to manufacture a key ingredient for antril but in early  synergens fortunes slipped on friday february  the company learned that its latest clinical trials showed antril was not nearly as effective as had been hoped the following monday synergen announced to the world that its trial tests on antril had been disappointing by the end of the day the companys stock price had plummeted by a heartstopping  the following day flabbergasted investorsand eager lawyersfiled eight separate lawsuits claiming that synergens executives had misled them about antrils potential the fallout continued in april president saxe and clinical director catalano resigned the two men cited differences in management philosophy as the reason for their departure but most observers suspected they were taking the fall for the poor performance of the companys best hope for a salable product despite antrils failure in the clinical trials though synergens scientists thought they saw a ray of hope data from the tests seemed to suggest that even though the drug didnt work on a broad range of sepsis patients it still might help the most severely ill ones so in august  the company launched new phase iii trials which it hoped would prove that antril still had some worth although with a drastically reduced potential market that light flickered out less than a year later on july   the company learned the results of those phase iii tests antril simply didnt work the following day a saturday synergen held its company picnic since none of the employees had been told of the test results everyone seemed to have a good time on monday the company announced that it was giving up on antril the product on which synergen had staked its corporate life the companys future looked bleak more than half of its  million stake was gone and on the day synergen announced that antril was a bust its stock freefell  percent two weeks later on august  the company laid off  percent of its member workforce by then its stock was trading at a miserable  recognizing that theyd soon run out of money synergens officers began looking for strategic alliances with other companiesin other words a bailout one obvious choice was amgen amgen was everything that synergen had hoped to become when the thousand oaks california company placed its initial stock offering in  shares sold for  since then the company has produced two blockbuster drugs and its stock has soared today amgen has sales of nearly  billion i have subscribers who have made  times their investment on amgen says jim mccamant editor of the medical technology stock letter according to sec filings synergen and amgen had discussed the possibility of a business relationship as early as  and as synergens future began to cloud in  company officials again met with amgen executives to discuss licensing synergens potential products in november of that year at a los angeles meeting synergen ceo greg abbott proposed that amgen provide a cash infusion amgen declined   in july  after antril had finally been declared a failure abbott and amgens ceo gordon binder talked again by phone several weeks later the companies financial officers met in boulder on august  synergen and amgen signed a confidentiality agreement and synergen opened its books to amgens scientists and bean counters on october  amgens top execs flew one more time to boulder and met with synergens top four officers three weeks after that on november  what was left of synergen found a new home amgen publicly announced that it was buying the boulder company the price  million the hefty price tag was deceptive however among other things amgen was buying synergens cashthe boulder company still had an estimated  million in cash reserves amgen also acquired synergens operating losses which industry analysts calculate translated into at least another  million in tax writeoffs for amgen finally amgen inflated its offer to include the estimated settlement price of the shareholder classaction lawsuit then pending against synergen that case was settled this march for  million synergen admitted no wrongdoing subtract all those things plus the value of synergens boulder complex and amgen got synergen for closer to  million that still may seem like a prodigious chunk of change but analysts say its peanuts for a company that once was considered one of the most promising biotech stocks in the country what had once been the twelfthlargest company in boulder county tried to take care of its former employees synergen set up a recruitment center so that other biotech firms could hire its laidoff workers it also allowed former employees free use of fax and copy machines and telephones for several months the company offered a decent severance package as well those who had worked at synergen for less than a year received six weeks pay with their pink slips others got more up to sixteen weeks worth of pay depending on how long theyd worked for synergen and the company bought back stock options workers had earned through their time there and through performance bonuses those measures dont begin to compare with the steps synergens executives took to cushion their fall however in fact the companys top officers had begun packing their parachutes several months earlier in april and may of  for instance shortly after the company revealed the disappointing clinical results for antril synergens board of directors approved new employment contracts with the companys officers according to disclosure documents on file with the sec the five top executives were to be paid anywhere from  soll to  ceo abbott because of the companys unfortunate performance and cash shortage some volunteered to accept less instead of taking the  he was entitled to by contract for example research and clinical affairs director robert thompson agreed to be paid only  synergens board helped soften the blow though all five men were promised severance packages of two years salary the full amount not the voluntarily reduced amount in the event of a change of control at synergen even more lucrative however was the boards vote to grant the companys top officers a controversial perk called stockoption repricing which reduced the amount they would have to pay if they exercised their stock options stock options are commonly used to compensate employees particularly executives they give the worker an opportunity to buy a piece of the company at a guaranteed price if the value of a companys stock later goes up the worker can then buy it at the lower price sell it at the new higher price and collect the difference for top officers especially stock options offer a powerful incentive if an executive works hard and well the thinking goes the companys value will increase and his stock options will reward him proportionately option repricing chips away at that incentive bud crystal a professor at the university of california at berkeleys haas school of business specializes in studying executive compensation he also helped the sec write new disclosure rules on stockoption repricing he says the idea of revising executives option prices downward after a company performs poorly is like a reverse highjump competition instead of being eliminated when they miss a jump the contestantsthe executivesare given another chance at a lower target its not an exciting sport for the crowd says crystal but its terribly exciting for the participants   repricing he concludes illustrates the perversity of executive compensation its not so much to give you pay for performance its just to give you pay according to sec filings in april  the compensation committee of synergens board of directors voted to lower the price of its executives stock options in a report the committee explained that it approved this action because it believes retaining key employees is in the best interest of the stockholders and the company the report continued during the spring of  following a decline in the stock price and a major restructuring which included a significant number of employee terminations key employees were being contacted by companies and agencies about employment opportunities elsewhere the committee believes repricing of the options was the most effective employment retention device available throughout  several officers took ample advantage of the opportunity to reprice their stock options abbott for instance had  options repriced from as high as  a share all the way down to  a share according to sec filings that november despite synergens disappointing year the board voted to award its executive officers still more stock options in lieu of a yearend bonus soll abbott thompson and vice presidents mark young and ken collins each received options to purchase  shares of stock for their roles in keeping the company on target with its goals and setting clear priorities according to a company disclosure filed with the sec those extra stock options came in handy the following summer on august  three days after amgen and synergen signed their confidentiality agreementsynergens board of directors voted to reprice its employee stock options one more time although employees had to swap three shares to receive two the good news was that any options they held to purchase stock at more than  were now reduced to  synergens executives had their landing padded one final time on october  two days after amgens and synergens top executives met in boulder and three months after the company laid off most of its workersthe board amended the employment contracts of synergens five top executives the new clauses were to be activated in the event of a change of control at synergen for starters each of the officers would receive  percent companypaid health dental and lifeinsurance benefits for two full years next with the exception of soll each of the men would get a onetime lump payment equal to a years salary and finally the october changes guaranteed that if an executive officer was terminated within twelve months of a change of control at synergen all his options to acquire stock in the company would become fully vested two weeks later synergen announced a whopping  million quarterly loss a week after that on november  amgen announced that it was buying synergen for  a share they lost their company but synergens top executives are now millionaires according to sec filings amgens agreement with synergen calls for stockholders to cash in their stocks and options within six months of the takeoverwhich means two weeks from now when he does if he hasnt already abbott will enjoy a lucrative payday thanks to his contract and the october amendment abbott will receive three times his annual salary or  next he cashes in his synergen stock about  shares that each fetch the  that amgen paid as part of the takeover deal thats another  finally as a result of the repricing agreements and the companys deal to fully vest its employees stock options the former synergen president and ceo gets to keep the difference between his drastically repriced options and their sale price to amgen that comes to a profit of  a share with his approximately  options thats another  million for abbott all of which adds up to a goodbye deal of about  million for the ceo who worked for synergen for eight years founder soll makes out even better even though he was entitled to only two years severance payor in the event of a change of control at synergen he owned a considerable chunk of stock in all soll checks out of the biotech business with a gold watch worth approximately  million unknown is how much of his own money soll spent to start the company fourteen years ago although collins hirsch thompson and young didnt do quite as well each left synergen with severance packages worth anywhere from  million collins to  million thompson the former executives werent willing to discuss their wellpadded departures former ceo abbott who still maintains an office at amgen was in spain last month although a secretary said he was calling in for messages former chairman soll did not return several messages left on his home telephone answering machine arthur hayes a synergen director who served on the compensation committee did not return numerous messages left at his home and company in new york and compensation committee chairman glenn utt reached through sugen inc another biotech company where he sits as a director declined to comment on the advice of his attorneys   according to an annual survey of biotech executives conducted by bioworld ceo compensation report of atlanta synergens executives worked for middling even low salaries by industry standards and while analysts acknowledge that the valuable goingaway presents voted to synergens executives were generous they say the packages were not outlandish for the business from a philosophical standpoint im opposed to golden parachutes says john clinebell chairman of the university of northern colorados finance department as a realist though i know that theyre very common indeed perhaps the most interesting thing about how lucrative synergen ended up being for its top officersdespite the companys evaporationis how common such deals appear to be in the biotechnology industry when amgen bought synergen it agreed to keep the company as a subsidiary for one year at the end of  synergen inc will no longer exist in the meantime some of the companys products are still spilling out of the pipeline in addition to antril for instance synergens labs had been investigating the possibilities of a drug called rhcntf which had shown some promise in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or lou gehrigs disease three months ago however rhcntf met the same fate as antril in february synergen now a division of amgen halted development of the drug results from the latest clinical trials showed that it performed no better than a placebo in late april the denver post published its annual listing of the regions hundred largest public companies in which analysts evaluated the corporations performances finishing dead last was synergen according to the analysts calculations an investor who bought  worth of synergen stock at the end of  would now have an asset worth a
