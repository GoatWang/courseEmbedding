valuation points to a  discount to its peer groupbackground info lannett company inc nysemktlci develops manufactures packages markets and distributes generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products in the united states it offers solid oral extended release topical nasal and oral solution finished dosage forms of drugs that address a range of therapeutic areas as well as ophthalmic patch foam buccal sublingual soft gel and injectable dosages the company provides its products for various medical indications comprising of glaucoma muscle relaxant migraine anesthetic congestive heart failure thyroid deficiency dryness of the mouth gout bronchospasms hypertension and gallstone it also manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients product diversification the ku acquisition adds  highmargin products to the current portfolio making the total marketed product count over  six of the products coming from the acquisition have sales north of  million annually with strong market positioning the largest contributor to kremers sales is methylphenidate xr an established highvalue product with limited competition and considerable upside kremers is one of only  companies in this space teva nyseteva and mallinckrodt nysemnk thereby increasing the likelihood of keeping pricing consistent or even being able to increase their pricing this drug is prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and narcolepsy the drug is more popularly known as concerta i believe the addressable market for concerta will continue to grow as more and more youth are being prescribed add and adhd medicine as a way to control hyperactive behavior the kremers product portfolio most importantly diversifies lannetts heavy reliance on the thyroid deficiency and gallstone categories for over  of revenues by category previously these two categories accounted for  of sales and now account for only  of sales thereby creating a much more balanced categorical revenue stream scale and industry the combined company has pro forma sales of m versus m in sales for lci as a standalone company thereby increasing revenues by a staggering  this is especially important as it makes it the largest generic company in the sub billion market cap teva and mylan nasdaqmyl are the clear market leaders in the generics field by size but this acquisition will put the combined company as the largest excluding these behemoth companies this will be vastly important as increased scale will decrease costs of production and industry consolidation should drive higher prices with less competition major blockbuster drugs are increasingly coming off patent with an estimated  billion worth of branded drugs coming off patent from  and  the massive size of branded drugs coming off patent is increasingly important for the major players such as the combined lannett company as it has the rd expertise scale resources and flexibility to choose its niche to further diversify sales in major categories these drugs add a significant growth opportunities for the best positioned generic companies and i believe lannett is the best in class of the smaller companies drug pipeline the acquisition of silarix and kremers adds significant marketed products that are currently being sold a strong pipeline in development as well as drugs currently pending approval management has been extremely efficient in obtaining approval for drugs and thus diversifying the companys revenue stream lannett has  products in development after the approval at kremers this is a very strong pipeline for any generic company and even more impressive given its relatively small size compared with industry leaders such as teva and mylan the more exciting part of this acquisition is that lannett currently has  drugs pending approval management has no effective way to include drugs that will be approved or will be rejected therefore they are completely left out of any guidance this is especially important as estimates are continually conservative thus making wall street punish lannett in the near term even as it continually beats estimates this is validated by its  consecutive quarters where sales and adjusted earnings per share exceeded the comparable prior year period pointing to the stability in its business model lannett still trades at a significant discount to peers even though it has displayed incredible consistency in its top and bottom line numbers lannett was recently recognized by fortune magazine as the fastest growing company in the united states it received this award before it made the transformational acquisition of kremers generic unit i believe the  drugs in development and pending approval in addition to the  billion in branded drugs coming off patent from  to  will give a huge runway for growth rd and manufacturing capacity the acquisition of silarix and kremers offers significant manufacturing and rd capacity silarix has a  square foot manufacturing and warehouse capacity that is fully staffed and has been in business for  years with no regulatory problems the kremers facility is a fully inspected  square foot stateoftheart facility in seymour indiana these facilities offer substantial manufacturing warehouse and product development capacity that is integral to avoid production bottlenecks with a company growing as fast as lannett management stated that they were considering investing in a fully outfitted rd center that would cost an estimated  million and could take as long as  years to gain full fda approval these acquisitions also show strong strategic purpose for lannett as it vies for market share in a quickly growing generic industry capital structure lannett previously operated with no debt  million in cash and  million credit revolver the kremers acquisition will leave the company with  million in liquidity cash and credit facility lannett will operate with  billion in debt which i believe is very reasonable given  million in ebit lannett has strong cash flow making the debt load very manageable i am very glad to hear managements intention to quickly decrease leverage for the company as i do not like to own companies that pay out a significant portion of earnings in interest payments the  million in liquidity gives management significant ability to make core business investments as well as any additional strategic acquisitions i like the fact that management is keeping adequate liquidity but i also want to see integration of the businesses before any significant acquisitions are made lannetts shift from negative leverage to obtaining a reasonable amount of leverage will significantly bolster operational results i believe that this is still massively underestimated by the investing community as a whole and will aid in beating future estimates on both the top and bottom line large insider ownership insider ownership is a topic often discussed across seeking alpha and the larger investment community i believe this is a massively underestimated factor that retail and institutional investors miss alike the obvious factor in high insider ownership is that shareholder and management interests are more highly aligned as they have a larger stake in the performance of the stock price the more important factor is that management will make decisions that create longterm value creation rather than making shortsighted decisions smart longterm strategic decisions are of special interest to investors who have a long horizon on holding stock such as i do the top  insider owners in lannett own  shares of the company with a market value of  based on market price per share of  the top  insider owners control  of the shares outstanding which is an extremely high figure for a company with a  billion market cap and points to their confidence in the company companies with a relatively small float due to high insider ownership are a favorite of mine as the small float discourages large institutional investors from having significant coverage on the stock this enables retail investors who do thorough due diligence to have a significant information advantage over the average shareholder valuation my valuation method uses evebit as ebit was the best measure of profitability given by lannett in its company presentation on the kremers acquisition looking at lannetts peers the range of evebit was in the range of x thus i used the low end of the range to maintain conservatism lannett trades at a  discount to its peers based on an evebit measure using a conservative multiple i believe this estimate is highly conservative based on lannetts management stating that they expect  million in operating synergies after the third year of operation which should all fall to the bottom line management also stated that they expect a  million tax benefit due to the acquisition on top of it being accretive to earnings by  in  lannett trades at a much lower pricetoearnings ratio of  than its peers such as akorn inc nasdaqakrx  and impax laboratories nasdaqipxl  which does not include the earnings from the recent acquisition the market leaders such as mylan trades at a pe of  and teva trades at  times earnings despite having lower growth rates than lannett i refrained from using a pe valuation method as impax and akorn skew the mean of the group with their astronomically higher valuation these figures serve as a demonstration to show how most similar competitors are valued even though they are not perfect comparisons risks increasing cost of generics  generics are suppose to be significantly discounted to the original patented version of the drug but prices have increased significantly over the past few years this has put the pharmaceutical industry as a whole under closer scrutiny as health care is increasingly becoming unaffordable if there is a serious crack down on prices lannett could suffer material pricing issues thus leading to lower sales and profitability i believe a major policy shift in pricing is largely mitigated by its extensive pipeline and the low precedence for significantly limiting the pricing power of the pharmaceutical industry debt load  lannett currently has a significant amount of debt on its books the  billion term loan will have a meaningful interest payment thus reducing its profitability in the near term management stated their intention to pay this down as quickly as possible unless a new strategic acquisition arises in which they may take on additional debt if necessary lannetts highmargin business creates a high level of cash flow thus enabling it to manage this debt thus reducing the threat of the leverage deteriorating all profitability the profitability of the combined companies should enable lannett to pay down the debt swiftly thus largely mitigating this risk reliance on jsp  the contracted production of jerome stevens pharmaceuticals contributes to a significant portion of sales the contacted production agreement was extended for  years until  thus reducing the likelihood of this relationship ending the revenue diversification from the kremers acquisition also helps reduce lannetts reliance on the production of jsps drugs any material change to the two companies relationship could impact lannetts fundamentals litigation  the company has a class action lawsuit brought against it by the eastern district of pennsylvania this suit was voluntarily dropped but any additional litigation could seriously impact the companys results conclusion the broader market has vastly underestimated lannett even though it was named the fastest growing company by fortune last year the kremers acquisition has meaningfully changed the capital structure from negative leverage to moderate leverage which will magnify strong top and bottom line growth the  drugs in development and pending approval create a massive runway for growth and enable lannett to significantly diversify its revenue i believe lannett has been assigned a lower multiple due to its previous reliance on digoxin and levothyroxine sodium but the market has yet to give lannett credit for the revenue diversification from the kremers acquisition and the inevitable diversification from its massive pipeline management has been extremely cautious with estimates and this has caused investors to push the stock down far below fundamental value my estimate points to a  discount to its peers despite showing stronger growth and multiple market opportunities a small market cap and a small float due to high insider ownership discourages many analysts from covering the company thus creating what i believe to
