environments these included shifts in vegetation zones changes in the hydrology and ecology of lakes and rivers and fluctuations in the size of mountain glaciers and sandy deserts until recently it was thought that such changes were triggered by fluctuations in the distribution of polar ice cover now there is increasing recognition that the tropics themselves have acted as drivers of global climate change over a range of timescales the aim of quaternary environmental change in the tropics is to provide a synthesis of the changes that occurred in tropical terrestrial and marine systems during the pleistocene and holocene complementing dataderived reconstructions with output from stateoftheart climate models it is targeted at finalyear undergraduate students and research specialists but will provide an introduction to tropical quaternary research for a variety of other readers see more see less table of contents list of contributors xi preface xiii acknowledgements xiv i global

has published extensively on environmental change in latin america with a particular focus on mexico  although primarily a palaeolimnologist her approach is very much multiproxy including the use of historical and instrumental records to help to improve our understanding of recent change david nash is professor of physical geography at the university of brighton uk he is widely known for his publications on the reconstruction of historical climate changes in southern africa as well as his broader research into the contemporary and quaternary geomorphology of dryland regions including the kalahari atacama and southern europe his research uses methods ranging from scanning electron microscopy and thinsection analysis to the interpretation of historical documents   see more see less reviews “all in all quaternary environmental change in the tropics provides a concise overview of the current knowledge of tropical quaternary climate as such it will be a very useful textbook for scholars focussing on this topic but at the same time it brings to light the poor record of early and middle pleistocene tropical climate”  geological journal  march    see more see less related
