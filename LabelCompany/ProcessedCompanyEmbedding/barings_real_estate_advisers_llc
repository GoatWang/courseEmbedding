securities without the benefit of a prospectus qualified under canadian securities law this site is governed by the laws of england     general risk factors investment involves risks the value of investments and any income generated may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed  past performance is not a guide to future performance •    the initial charges such as broker’s charges and stamp duty will have an impact on the value of an investors holding particularly in the short term •    investors should regard their holdings as a long term investment •    shares in the company have been admitted to the official list and are traded on the london stock exchanges market for listed securities accordingly shares are purchased by investors through the stock market and therefore investors will not be able to cancel their purchase however in respect of investments made within an individual savings account isa investors will have a  day period in which they can change their mind •    due to their fixed capital structure investment trusts are able to borrow to raise further funds which can be used to buy additional securities for their portfolio when the manager of the investment trust and its board of directors consider that it may be commercially advantageous for the investment trust to do so this is generally described as gearing an investment trust which has purchased additional assets as a result of gearing may have a more volatile share price than one which does not since gearing can increase shareholder returns in rising markets but conversely can increase the extent to which the value of the funds attributable to shareholders decreases in falling markets •    changes in rates of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value price or income of an investment •    investors should be aware of the additional risks arising from companies trading on or investing in stock markets of emerging or developing countries where price volatility may be greater and the ability of the investment trust to buy and sell its portfolio easily and without influencing its price commonly known as the liquidity of the market may be lower than those experienced in more developed economies and stock markets there is also a risk associated with different settlement and custody practices •    where the income earned by an investment trust is insufficient to cover charges and expenses the balances will be charged to capital which may constrain capital growth •    investors should be aware that the company has warrants in issue a warrant is a time–limited right to subscribe for shares debentures loan stock or government securities and is exercisable against the original issuer of the underlying securities a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement unfavourable or favourable in the price of the warrant the prices of warrants can therefore be volatile it is essential that investors wishing to purchase warrants understand that the right to subscribe which a warrant confers is invariably limited in time with the consequence that if the investor fails to exercise this right within the predetermined time–scale then the investment becomes worthless you should not buy a warrant unless you are prepared to sustain a total loss of the money you have invested plus any commission or other transaction charges the information on this site does not constitute investment tax legal or other advice or recommendation or an offer to sell or an invitation to buy shares or

investors should seek independent financial advice and read all relevant documents relating to the company such as its report and accounts and prospectus which describe the particular risks associated with an investment together with any specific restrictions which may be applicable and the basis of dealing investment in a fund is not intended to be a complete investment program for any investor an investment should be viewed as a medium to longterm investment as part of your long term investment planning you should consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a range of investments and
