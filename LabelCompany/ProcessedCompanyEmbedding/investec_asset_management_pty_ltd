investment and industry trends that have shaped our business and approach to investing he also looks ahead to the major longterm themes that will shape the next quarter century for our business in a more challenging investment landscape tomorrow’s world what investment trends have shown consistent resilient performance and returns over the last  years what will be those of the next  years how will the rise of emerging markets shape the way we look at the world how do we invest for a better tomorrow and why capability heads and leaders from across the business reflect on these questions and more for an explanation of any technical terms please refer to the glossary towards the future the world has changed profoundly over the past quarter century although the fundamentals of investment remain essentially the same the investment process has become a lot faster the data revolution has not only speeded up analysis but also transformed the nature of the active manager’s challenge managers no longer simply need to find more data and create better intelligence than their competitors they must see through a surfeit of data to find superior insight our clients have also changed today asset owners are much better informed and more knowledgeable about asset management processes their priorities are also changing with the ageing demographics of their stakeholders who are also demanding more attention to the environmental and social impact of how their savings are invested and require greater oversight of their investments as the actors have changed so has the setting investment managers are facing several new challenges that will shape the way we allocate capital in the future meeting new challenges  global disruptions the last  years have been characterised by disruption and crises” says russell silberston head of multiasset absolute return “sterling was ejected from the exchangerate mechanism in  there was the asian financial crisis in  the bursting of the dotcom bubble in  then there was the ‘big one’ – the global financial crisis in  it goes on markets are uncertain we cannot quantify what they’re going to do” but while there have always been market disruptions it is also likely that their effects will be widerreaching philip saunders cohead of multiasset growth explains that “globalisation has changed the way markets have behaved our clients are now international rather than domestic and allocate capital globally this means that we have to understand how global dynamics materially impact markets and their investments”  changes in the markets navigating market crises and helping our clients understand the short and longterm consequences of these disruptions is an essential part of investment management but we are now also facing profound changes to the way the markets work as our cochief investment officer and cohead of factor™ equity james hand explains “there’s been the growth of highfrequency traders there’s been a big shift from active to passive managers accelerated in the recent past by the growth of etfs and smart beta” he says james believes these changes are working against each other in a way that will exacerbate disruption in the future “markets should be becoming more efficient with increased speed but they should also be becoming less efficient with the growth of passive investing” he says the resulting tension he believes “really highlights some key issues for investors to think about in the future”  sustainable development to deal with these challenges we have to be more innovative “the big challenge for the world today can be summarised in two words sustainable development” says hendrik “by the middle of this century we’ll have  billion people on earth we need to invest in a sustainable way so there will be significant commercial opportunities in financing not only the infrastructure but also in the businesses and the assets which will cater for that kind of world” the way forward  attention to environmental social and governance issues investing in a sustainable future will be one of the major trends of the coming years as a firm we believe that playing a role in financing sustainable development is a central part of our mission of “doing the right thing” the imperative to invest sustainably was also underlined on a global level in  the paris agreement on climate change and the united nations sustainable development goals which were agreed to by the majority of the countries on the planet even if they are not yet fully ratified are clarion calls for the world to work together to take action this imperative is also driven by our clients for example pension funds are aligning their investment practices with the values of their members as the demographics of retirement savers include larger proportions of individuals from generation x generation y and even now the millennials who care more deeply about social and environmental issues the vehicles through which they save need to reflect their values for many pension funds taking account of sustainability issues is even shaping how they view their fiduciary duty to their members the immediate priority is therefore that integrating an analysis of environmental social and governance esg challenges and risks into the investment process “we believe it adds more value for our clients if we treat material esg issues as an integral part of the investment analysis and decisionmaking process rather than as a separate consideration” james hand says he is also seeing more clients who require these issues to be included in quarterly reportbacks and a larger number of clients requesting segregated mandates with exclusions and esgspecific screens  active ownership as we sharpen our focus on esg and face greater scrutiny from our clients we believe that when we invest in the equity of companies we should be active shareholders the quality team for example typically conducts several hundred meetings each year with management teams to ensure they are comfortable with their decisionmaking processes simon brazier cohead of quality explains that “it’s important for us to engage with companies because we’re longterm investors these meetings not only give us valuable insight into company strategy but also enable us to make sure that the objectives of the management team are aligned with our aims as a shareholder” additionally simon says meeting with management teams enables his team to make sure that they have the longterm health of their companies at heart “more than half of what we’re looking for in companies is how they grow their profits and returns” he says “management teams have a corporate responsibility to act in the longterm interest of their company its shareholders and stakeholders they shouldn’t focus on shortterm pressures like returning cash to shareholders or increasing compensation”  dealing with low rates and disinflation we believe that really knowing the intricacies of the securities you own is vital in this time of great change for the investment environment “we are moving from a relatively inflationary regime to a disinflationary and in some cases deflationary regime and that has changed the rules of the game in terms of the behaviour of different asset classes” says philip saunders philip observes two principal causes for this shift first a long secular bond bull market has just ended until relatively recently bond yields have been healthy particularly longdated bonds but there is a strong likelihood that developedmarket bond returns will remain depressed for some time and the environment broadly disinflationary “declining inflation expectations have also acted as a strong tail wind for equity valuations resulting in a rerating” says philip “conversely it has been negative for assets that benefit from inflation such as gold and other commodities despite some strong countertrend rallies” second the accumulation of debt through quantitative easing programmes from the us federal reserve the fed the bank of england and latterly the european central bank has risen to unprecedented levels such expansionary monetary policy has further depressed real interest rates and hampered economic growth russell silberston believes that “negative rates are here to stay for the foreseeable future so investors need to think about alternative approaches to their traditional defensive asset class” as a result philip believes that we “have got to search more broadly for opportunities and we have got to be prepared to be a bit more flexible from an asset allocation perspective” one of russell’s suggestions is that asset owners might want to rethink their use of marketcapitalised government bond benchmarks and instead think of other strategies such as looking at bonds with shorter maturities “they can also exploit new opportunities by widening the investment universe or boost returns by hedging currency exposure”  adapting to changes in emerging markets “one of the big changes in financial markets has been the emergence of emerging markets into the mainstream” says hendrik du toit “that process will continue” peter eerdmans agrees pointing out that these countries change “it’s almost the definition of emerging markets that they are going through a process of profound change” he says we must therefore be cognisant of the fact that the countries we think of as emerging today may not be the emerging markets of tomorrow emerging markets have become more interconnected over time simon brazier notes that “emerging markets are becoming an increasingly important part of the investment landscape i’m a uk equity fund manager but nearly a third of the revenues of companies that i can invest in come from developing or emerging markets they may be listed in london but emerging markets are vital for their growth” and this holds true for policy making as well as business “with globalisation the fed is even looking at china to impact its monetary policy” he says “this is a profound change in the global policy landscape” this shift has material consequences for the investment strategies we employ as countries develop and become higher quality with stronger monetary and fiscal policies they start trading more like developed markets as a result a static investment process that focuses purely on credit risks for example will struggle to outperform on the more developed side of emerging markets being prepared so what do these challenges tell us about how we should think about investingwhat unique insight do we have investec asset management is one of the first firms to have developed a global mainstream fund management business from emergingmarket roots we believe that our journey to this point has taught us that we must adapt to the environment as we find it not how we would like it to be “from time to time the investment landscape gets disrupted it’s a fact” says hendrik the disruptions of the last  years have taught us is that as global financial markets become more integrated more than ever we need to build diversified and resilient portfolios to preserve and grow our clients’ capital but doing so doesn’t mean shying away from taking on appropriate risk in a complex and uncertain investment environment we need to search more broadly for opportunities adapt our strategies and processes where necessary we need to keep evolving this doesn’t mean throwing out all the old models but working from a stable core of investment beliefs so what do the next  years hold no one has a crystal ball but we believe that whatever happens it is important that we focus on doing the right thing for our clients by acting in a way that reflects their values and aspirations as well as our own we need to make sure that we steward our clients’ money safely and that means adapting to market changes and disruptions we also have a responsibility to think about the long term and leaving a better future for the savers of today “investing is all about tomorrow not today” says hendrik “so i would argue that investment should be about a better tomorrow and a better future”   past performance is not a guide to the future and investments carry a risk of capital loss emerging markets may have less developed legal political economic andor other systems these markets may therefore carry a higher risk of financial loss than those in countries generally regarded as being more developed the views expressed are those of the contributors at the
