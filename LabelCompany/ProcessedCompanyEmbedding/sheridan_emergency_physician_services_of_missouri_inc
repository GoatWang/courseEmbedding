part of the hospital the parent which is a legal entity the legal entity must obtain an npi the psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own npi if the hospital determines that

neither the pharmacy line of business nor the dme line of business represent legal entities instead both lines of business are part of an organization the parent that is a legal entity each line of
