hooper homes on twitter and facebook hooper holmes health professionals quality makes a difference   earlier this week i spoke with john bond vice president of provider relations here at hooper holmes about our network of health professionals john has  years of experience developing healthcare provider networks and maximizing those networks’ quality and efficiency i asked for his insight on health professionals and what makes hooper holmes’ network of hps unique to the industry what does a hooper holmes health professional do health professionals hps are the face of hooper holmes and the face of our customers they visit sites across the country in all  states to conduct biometric screenings during the screening our hps draw blood take measurements complete paperwork and give counseling as needed they are also responsible for ensuring that the specimens and data collected are properly packaged and labeled and that they are delivered to the lab for testing as soon as possible hooper holmes hps are required to go to a fedex or ups store not a drop box so that they can hand the specimens to a person who will ensure their delivery what makes our network of hps unique hooper holmes’ regional field management team partners with event management and hp recruiting to oversee our hps and ensure that the professionals we have in our network are the best in the industry we don’t assume that all hps get equal results we know that a consistent attention to detail and high quality makes a real difference to participants that’s why we actively monitor our hps’ work for accuracy and consistency when we find hps who are consistently conducting errorfree exams and providing participants with a fantastic screening experience we make sure they are considered first for screenings we support our hps with a team of regional field supervisors the field supervisors are all seasoned active hps they have a wealth of experience and can offer our network direct coaching and mentoring on ways to avoid common mistakes and strategies to improve the consistency and quality of their work to become one of our bestinclass hps we also have an industryleading approach to bring highquality new recruits into our network employees in field management event management and hp recruiting review upcoming screenings on a regular basis together they determine which existing hps are best suited to ensure the success of each screening they also identify those areas of the country that require additional hp coverage as we continue to grow our business and increase the volume of screenings we complete each year once new hp recruits have been fully vetted and trained they are now partnered with a seasoned bestinclass hp to observe an actual screening in a mentoring role before they are ever assigned to a screening as an hp this partnership and opportunity for additional mentoring allows the new recruit to observe an actual hooper holmes screening ask any questions they might have and ensure they are completely comfortable and prepared before they go out for their first screening why is it important to have a quality hp our hps represent not only hooper holmes but also the customers that we provide services for they are placing their trust in the hands of our hps and we must ensure that we hire responsible trustworthy hps it is crucial that each individual is treated with care and that his or her privacy and identity is protected the quality of the hp’s work not only reflects on hooper holmes and the companies we work with but it can also affect the type of wellness services an individual is offered what errors and outcomes are prevented when screenings are conducted by quality hps when quality hps conduct screenings the individuals and groups being screened can trust that they will be given accurate results that will lead them to make the best choices to improve their health a risk assessment can look drastically different from the reality if an hp writes down incorrect information such as an incorrect height or weight a person with significant health risks may be overlooked or at the opposite end of the spectrum a healthy person may be needlessly flagged for risks if an hp reports incorrect data for one person the rest of the group will inevitably question the accuracy of their results in essence quality health professionals reinforce the integrity of the wellness programs that companies are trying to get their employees involved in what qualifications and certifications are hps required to have hooper holmes health professionals must have all the required state licensures and pass a criminal background check in addition they must have experience drawing blood at least  recent draws before being considered hps also go through a thorough interview and reference check process then once hired they must complete a training program which includes shadowing a bestinclass hp for one session in addition to having the proper qualifications what qualities and skills do we look for when hiring hps beyond the aforementioned requirements we look for several qualities when considering health professionals we look for individuals who are professional in appearance as well as manner they must have excellent blood draw skills as well as excellent people skills how our hps interact with the people being screened is very important it reflects on us the company and on the wellness program itself additionally we look for hps who are consistent and reliable and who have excellent attention to detail if you’d like

matter what the weather’s like where you live today is the official start of spring january may be the time for setting goals and making resolutions but we’ve always found that by this time of year those resolutions could use some refreshing spring is the perfect time for a fresh start especially for your health and fitness goals here are  ways to make wellness a priority this spring after months of being stuck inside it’s time to get outdoors why not find a new walking trail or path to explore in your area if you’re not sure where you can go the american heart association has a walking path finder on its website just enter your zip code and it will suggest paths in your area spring is the perfect time to check out your local farmer’s market buy some fresh local produce that’s in season and try a new recipe or two to show off your finds here are a few ideas to get you started were “lose weight” or “eat healthier” among your new year’s resolutions if you’ve lost steam try setting more specific goals instead and making a plan to follow them if your goal is to get more fruits and vegetables in your diet that’s one of mine this year try making a weekly menu plan that includes healthy fruit or vegetable side dishes my new favorite is ovenroasted broccoli with garlic red pepper flakes and just a little parmesan cheese  prepare for a rainy day by stocking your pantry with healthy staples quinoa tuna packed in water sundried tomatoes and roasted red peppers are all great options but choose items that your family will like on days when you’re exhausted or don’t have time to make a trip to the grocery store you’ll still have a healthy meal at your fingertips find a friend family member or coworker who is also working towards a health and fitness goal encourage each other by making dates to go to the gym or go walking together and by finding time to talk each week to share successes and challenges try a new outdoor activity get some friends together and play a team sport like volleyball or softball or find out if there’s a place you can rent a bicycle and go on a ride shake up your lunch routine it’s easy to get too busy to plan for lunch then order something unhealthy that you’ll regret later instead take a little time before the start of your work week and do your lunchprepping for example make a large batch of a healthy pasta salad this one from health magazine looks delicious and easy to make and then put it into individual easytopack containers add a piece of fruit and a square of dark chocolate and you have a lunch that beats takeout any day of the week move aside corned beef with cabbage  healthy green dinners for st patrick’s day what comes to mind when you think of st patrick’s day food most of us think of that infamous irish dish corned beef with cabbage however with spring’s rapid approach many of us are looking to ditch heavy rich meals in favor of something a little lighter in the spirit of both healthy eating and st patrick’s day here are  green familyfriendly meals lemony chicken and asparagus stir fry from skinnytaste a stir fry is always a quick weeknight option and this one won’t bust your calorie budget serve it with brown rice mix in some edamame for added nutrition and festivity slowcooker chicken and white beans with kale pesto from henry happened the slow cooker is a weeknight cook’s best friend and i love finding healthy slow cooker recipes like this one this meal requires minimal prep work cooking the onions and garlic a little to soften them although i imagine this step could be omitted if necessary and making the pesto with the help of a food processor pistachiocrusted salmon from fitness magazine turn st patrick’s day dinner into an elegant affair with this special occasionworthy entrée serve this salmon with roasted baby potatoes and a spinach and orange salad is pizza your goto meal this white pizza with lemony greens from take a megabite combines salad and main dish all in
