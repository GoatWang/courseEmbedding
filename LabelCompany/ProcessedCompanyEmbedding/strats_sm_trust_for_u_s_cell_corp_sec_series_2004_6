ambac financial group inc robert j genader and sean t leonard defendants united states district court sd new york december   memorandum decision and order denying defendants motion to dismiss the complaint mcmahon judge this action raises what appears to be a question of first impression in this circuit does the second circuits decision in ontario pub serv employees union pension trust fund v nortel networks corp  fd  d cir  hereinafter nortel bar the purchasers of a derivative securities product from bringing a b action against the issuer of the securities that were bundled by a second issuer to create the derivative i conclude that it does not at least not on the facts of this case because defendants other challenges to the face of the complaint are unpersuasive and for the most part premature their motion to dismiss is denied facts the following facts are pleaded in the complaint and as is always the case are presumed true for purposes of this motion ambac ambac was founded in  through its principal operating subsidiary ambac assurance corporation it guaranteed public and private finance obligations it was for example the first financial guarantor to insure the principal and interest of municipal bonds ambac became known as a monoline insurer because it provided only one type of insurance a guarantee to protect against the risk of default on credit instruments ambac built a goldplated reputation as one of the leading financial guarantee insurers in the world it was known for insuring only the highest quality municipal bonds assessing risk to a remoteloss underwriting standard ambacs  form k advised investors that it only insured exposures that are of investment grade quality with a remote risk of loss compl ¶  in ambacs public filings and in public statements made by its executive officers ambac told investors that it exercised rigorous and conservative underwriting standards to ensure that it only guaranteed and provided credit enhancement for the safest transactions that it diligently monitored its insured portfolios and that it was exposed to no material risk of loss id ¶  various analysts from major commercial and investment banks relying on those disclosures issued reports stating in substance that ambac was not the market and that given ambacs strict underwriting standards id ¶  quoting report of deutsche bank it was unlikely to suffer significant losses on its mortgage portfolio ambac first obtained a aaa credit rating—highest rating available—in  and that rating never declined regardless of the fortunes of the market until the events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred id ¶¶   ambacs aaa credit rating was integral to its business success indeed the companys business model depended on maintaining its aaa rating in its  form k ambac stated triplea financial strength ratings    are an essential part of ambac assurances ability to provide credit enhancement and any reduction in these ratings could have a material adverse affect on ambac assurances ability to compete in the financial guarantee business id ¶  alteration in original maintenance of the aaa credit rating was of course dependent on the soundness of the investments that ambac guaranteed the companys stated capital and claims paying ability were but a small fraction of the net financial guarantees ambac had in force in the first quarter of  plaintiffs allege that the failure of as little as  of ambacs insured portfolio would be enough to wipe out ambacs excess capital for that reason the quality of the companys underwriting and risk exposure monitoring was highly material to investors id ¶  ambacs role in the structured finance market beginning in at least  ambac guaranteed billions of dollars of private assetbacked structured financial instruments supported by collateral including  residential mortgage backed securities rmbs which are collateralized by the underlying mortgages and  collateralized debt obligations cdos which are supported by large bundles of securitized rmbs rather than by the mortgages directly ambac directly insured the rmbs and it issued credit default swaps cds to guarantee cdos that were backed by bundles of rmbs id ¶  according to the complaint ambac played a key role in the explosion of the rmbs and cdo markets by providing direct insurance for rmbs and by providing protection for cdos that were collateralized by bundles of rmbs via the use of credit default swaps ambac also allegedly insured increasing amounts of rmbs backed by secondary lien second mortgage loans often home equity lines of credit such loans are of course riskier than first lien loans because repayment is directly related to the borrowers ability to pay down the underlying first mortgage and ambac did not need to allocate as much capital to support credit default swaps which made them at once riskier and more profitable for the company id ¶¶  plaintiffs allege that ambac effectively sold its aaa credit rating to enhance the credit rating of bonds and asset backed securities id ¶  at the direction of its executive officers defendants genader and leonard ambac drastically lowered its underwriting standards so that it could wrap or guarantee billions of dollars of high risk securities id ¶  internal quotations omitted the alleged mastermind of this strategic shift was genader who purportedly focused ambac on the generation of greater profits rather than on risk management and loss avoidance in an effort to achieve net income of  billion per year in the near future id ¶  his purported motive for increasing revenue was of course his own pocketbook his compensation was tied directly to ambacs reported returns on equity and he profited handsomely during  and —to the tune of over  million id  the importance to ambac of preserving its credit rating and avoiding excessive risk came into conflict with the desire to earn more and more money ambacs safe and stable municipal bond insurance business was a diminishing source of growth id ¶  in order to achieve the income levels genader desired ambac became more and more reliant on revenues from the riskiest corners of the derivative securities business id ¶  accord id ¶  this required ambac to relax its historic underwriting standards in various ways one way was to adopt a new underwriting model one designed to approve riskier portfolios of rmbs by relying on historical analysis of the originators default rates rather than the quality of the loans that were actually in the securitized portfolio id ¶  yet all the while ambac was advising the market that it was still engaged in conservative underwriting id ¶  ambac securitizes its risky investments through wachovia plaintiffs are investors who purchased a derivative product known as structured repackaged assetbacked trust securities callable class a certificates series  stratssm trust for ambac financial group inc securities series  hereinafter strats the strats which bore an interest rate of  were issued on june   the purported class period runs from the date of issuance through and including april   plaintiffs and other strats owners have by virtue of their investment a beneficial interest in a trust that is funded with a single asset securities issued by ambac known as ambac february  directlyissued subordinated capital securities discs bearing an interest rate of  the strats themselves however were not issued by ambac rather they were packaged and issued by a subsidiary of wachovia bank known as synthetic fixedincome securities inc sfis emphasis added— which is one of the most aptly descriptive names for a special purpose vehicle since lhiw lets hope it works inc see wellman v dickinson  fsupp  sdny  both the wachoviaissued strats and the underlying ambacissued discs are assetbacked securities assetbacked securitization is a financing technique in which financial assets are pooled and converted into instruments that can be sold in capital markets an entity known as the sponsor in this case ambac originates or acquires a pool of financial assets the discs and then sells those assets to an issuer sfiswachovia which places the assets in a specially created investment vehicle usually a trust that issues and sells interests securities that are backed supported by the underlying financial assets transactions that pool and securitize outstanding debt securities issued by third party companies are marketed to retail investors and are listed on a national securities exchange compl ¶  payment on assetbacked securities is a function of cash flows generated by the assets in the underlying pool id ¶  in this case while the discs are the underlying financial assets that immediately back the strats the real underlying assets were the residential mortgages themselves which had been securitized via rmbs and perhaps securitized again into cdos which were guaranteed by ambac which securitized its own guarantees by creating the discs and selling them off to the public through the medium of sifs the complaint alleges—and it is obvious enough—that abs securities and abs issuers differ significantly from gardenvariety corporate securities and their issuers when it comes to making the disclosures required under the federal securities laws the issuer of the abs in this case sfis generally has no business or management to describe—it is a socalled special purpose vehicle spv and its business consists of taking pools of assets that were assembled by someone else many of which are themselves abs like rmbs and cdos and securitizing or resecuritizing those pools plaintiffs allege that abs investors value securities by examining the characteristics and quality of the underlying asset pool and the timing and certainty of cash flows from the underlying asset pool plaintiffs further allege that the securities and exchange commission sec has recognized the unique nature of abs products to the point of providing a separate regulatory framework to govern them of particular importance to this case are sec regulations that allow the issuer of an assetbacked security to make the disclosures required by the securities laws by referring to the filings of the issuer of the security that backs the abs  cfr §  et seq this rule recognizes the fact that an abs issuer would find it difficult to obtain and analyze some other partys financial information and so sends the investor back to the underlying issuers financial statements for information pertinent to the investment decision compl ¶  in the prospectus and registration statement for strats here at issue sfis refers to ambacs public filings with respect to the discs and informed investors that they should obtain and evaluate the same information concerning the underlying issuer as they would obtain and evaluate if they were investing directly in the discs or in other debt securities issued by the underlying issuer id ¶  internal quotations omitted the prospectus also cautioned strats purchasers that they would be exposed to the credit risk of the underlying issuer the underlying issuer was of course ambac id internal quotations omitted so plaintiffs and other members of the putative class purchased strats an abs backed solely by ambacissued debt securities the discs which were in turn backed by pools of collateralized debt obligations on mortgagebacked securities or by mortgagebacked securities themselves all of which were insured or guaranteed by ambac purportedly in accordance with its highlytouted historic underwriting standards the strats prospectus stated that it was a condition to the issuance of the strats that they be rated by standard  poors rating services sp at least as highly as the underlying securities the underlying securities are the discs which were at the time rated a by sp id ¶  the alleged securities fraud plaintiffs contend that ambac genader and leonard knew or were reckless in not knowing that ambacs own publicly issued securities including the discs that were repackaged into the strats were losing market value because of the increasing likelihood of default on residential mortgages this loss of value in turn jeopardized ambacs ability to repay the debt securities the discs that backed the strats owned by plaintiffs id ¶  starting in  and extending into  plaintiffs allege that the quality of mortgage loans that were pooled together into rmbsrelated deals deteriorated with each successive quarter ambac which received monthly or quarterly reports on all the transactions that it guaranteed id ¶  and which purported to conduct quarterly reviews and perform due diligence with respect to mortgage originators id ¶  had to have been aware of the increase in delinquency rates and default rates on the underlying loans in the rmbs it was insuring yet ambac did not mark its cdos to market as required by statement of financial accounting standards  sfas entitled accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities this had the effect of inflating ambacs earnings allowing the company to show a profit and positive earnings per share when it was in fact experiences significant losses id ¶¶  by june  when the strats were marketed ambac and its executive officers were well aware that the housing market had been in decline for months according to plaintiffs this was apparent by late  see id ¶¶   during the class period rather than report collateral deterioration and marktomarket writedowns in line with a deteriorating market defendants allegedly bolstered ambacs stock price by insisting that market deterioration did not indicate any deterioration in ambacs portfolio id ¶  as noted above various analysts bought into ambacs representations telling their customers that ambac was not the market and that that the companys conservative management team was comfortable that losses will be minimal id ¶  internal quotations omitted yet when someone not ambac finally disclosed what collateral underlay ambacinsured cdos studies revealed that the rmbs insured by ambac did not perform better than the market at all while the average percentage of underlying mortgages in ambacinsured rmbs that were in delinquency by  days was under  in the summer of  that figure had doubled by the end of  tripled by the late summer of  and quadrupled by the end of  plaintiffs allege that ambacs reported earnings for the years  through  were more than wiped out by the massive writedowns and increased reserves that ambac would be forced to take when the mortgage markets froze in the fall of — only months after the issuance of the strats that plaintiffs purchased on january   a mere  months after sfis issued the strats ambac announced that it was taking  billion in marktomarket writedowns on its then  billion in exposure to cdos supported by rmbs as well as recognizing  billion of actual impairment on these exposures ambac nearly tripled its loss reserves due to the deterioration of its direct rmbs portfolio and reduced dividend payouts by  in response to this announcement the trading price of strats securities collapsed falling from  per class a certificate to  in just three days further announcements during the class period revealed that ambacs rmbs included a wide range of loans whose characteristics were far riskier than had previously been disclosed and ambac reported massive losses at the end of the first quarter  ambacs debt securities declined in value so dramatically that the price of strats reached  on november   id ¶¶  this lawsuit followed defendants moved to dismiss arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue them because they had purchased securities issued by an entity other than ambac sfis defendants also asserted that the massive and detailed  paragraph  page complaint—which specifically identifies the time and content of dozens of allegedly false disclosures—failed to meet the pleading standards for a securities fraud complaint the motion is denied in all respects discussion i standard of review to survive a motion to dismiss a complaint must contain sufficient factual

underwriting criteria and business prospects defendants say not indeed defendants say that the second circuits decision in nortel which binds this court resolves the question in their favor plaintiffs say not so i agree with plaintiffs to understand why it is necessary to discuss nortel  fd  d cir  in some detail in nortel the plaintiff purchased stock in a public company called jds uniphase a manufacturer of fiber optic components jds uniphase had an extensive business relationship with a second public company nortel networks which was a global supplier of telecommunications services indeed nortel was jds largest customer accounting for  of the latters revenues nortel also made fiber optics products at a time when the market was flooded with rumors that jds was going to sell part of its business to nortel in exchange for nortel stock nortel publicly made several rosy prognostications about the demand for its ie nortels fiber optics products and also predicted  growth in revenue and earnings for  both nortel and jds stock moved up following nortels statements however within days after nortel and jds consummated the asset sale described above nortel cut revenue estimates for the quarter and announced that revenue growth for  would be closer to  following this announcement the value of both nortel and jds shares tumbled in heavy trading plaintiffs sued nortel under section b and rule b thereunder alleging that nortels favorable statements about its own business prospects  were false in that nortel had actually known for some time that demand was falling for its fiber optics products and  had caused jdss stock price to inflate thereby causing plaintiffs to purchase their jds shares at an artificially high price nortel sought dismissal on the ground that jds shareholders lacked standing to sue nortel for allegedly misleading disclosures about nortels business the district court berman j granted nortels motion the second circuit affirmed judge bermans ruling the court of appeals noted that neither section b of the securities and exchange act of   act nor rule b thereunder explicitly created a private right of action in favor of anyone nonetheless various courts had implied such a right of action since at least  nortel  fd at  in blue chip stamps v manor drug stores  us   the supreme court had ruled that only purchasers or sellers of securities could sue under the antifraud provisions of the  act and rule b writing for the panel in nortel judge pooler noted that in this case plaintiffs are quick to point out that they did purchase securities after the alleged misrepresentations took place however instead of purchasing securities of the entity that made the alleged misrepresentation they purchased securities of a company that had a business relationship with the misrepresenter they claim that they have met the blue chip stamps standing requirements because they purchased the security at issue in their lawsuit they base this argument on the references in section b and rule b to fraudulent conduct in connection with the purchases or sale of any security in plaintiffs view the word any indicates that the intent of congress and the sec was to create universal standing for purchasers of securities allowing anyone who made use of the markets to sue under rule b  f d at  citations omitted having set out plaintiffs argument the court of appeals proceeded to reject it plaintiffs assume that the phrase any security includes securities of any company affected in some way by the misrepresentation and not just securities of the company that makes the material misstatements however in our view the phrase indicates that the regulations reach all types of securities and not any affected companys securities furthermore plaintiffs interpretation of this passage is entirely at odds with the purchaserseller requirement in blue chip stomps that limits the class of plaintiffs to those who have at least dealt in the security to which the prospectus representation or omission relates id citations omitted after additional discussion of precedents the circuit summarized its holding stockholders do not have standing to sue under section b and rule b when the company whose stock they purchased is negatively impacted by the material misstatement of another company whose stock they do not purchase id at  for several years after nortel various defendants relying on the language just quoted and an equally sweeping statement elsewhere in the second circuits opinion argued—sometimes successfully—that no liability can exist under rule b for statements by a nonissuer of the security that is the subject of the suit about a nonissuer see eg in re nyse specialists sec litig  fsuppd   sdny  citation omitted the second circuit put that notion to rest however when it reversed the district courts dismissal of the complaint in the nyse specialists case see in re nyse specialists sec litig  fd  d cir  in an opinion by nowjustice sotomayor the court noted that an overly broad reading of the abovequoted language would place beyond the reach of rule b false statements made by underwriters brokers bankers and nonissuer sellers id at  justice sotomayor went on to say that this was not what the nortel court had in mind on the basis of a business relationship between jds uniphase and nortel networks the plaintiffs claimed that their purchase price for jds uniphase stock had been inflated by nortel networks false statements about itself in the particular circumstances of the case the connection between nortel networks false statements about itself and the plaintiffs purchase of jds uniphase stock was too remote to sustain an action under rule b in short the district court incorrectly read nortel networks to mean that an action under rule b for false statements about a security purchased by the plaintiff lies only against the issuer of the security or that only statements about a security issuer are actionable accordingly we vacate the district courts decision with respect to statutory standing id it is thus quite clear that defendants simplistic analysis of nortel is predicated on a reading of that decision that the second circuit has disavowed whether a purchaser or seller of a security has standing to bring an action under the antifraud provisions of the  act is ultimately a function of the remoteness between the false statements and the plaintiffs purchase of a particular stock standing is not exclusively a function of who made the false statements although that is undoubtedly one factor a court can consider in making its determination thus much as defendants might wish it nortel does not mandate dismissal of plaintiffs complaint indeed much of what is quoted above from nortel augurs in favor of according these plaintiffs standing to sue ambac unlike the plaintiffs in nortel plaintiffs here purchased a security that was by its terms directly related to the business of ambac the security was a derivative created out of financial assets that belonged to ambac the security was no doubt created at the behest of ambac the idea behind securitizing financial assets is to pass the risk represented by those assets off to someone else see generally steven l schwarcz the alchemy of asset securitization  stan j l bus  fin    the securities were held in a trust for ambac indeed the securities name includes the word ambac the name does not include any reference to wachovia or sfis the technical issuer furthermore the security purchased by the plaintiffs was a security to which the alleged misrepresentations relate    in nortel the second circuit relying on the supreme courts decision in blue chip stamps recognized that relationship as the key element in the standing equation the sec understands this it requires the special purpose vehicles that issue derivatives like the strats to tell potential purchasers that they should look to the disclosures made by the company whose assets are securitized when they assess the risk of their investment thus a rule promulgated by the agency responsible for regulating the securities markets makes it clear that plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent—persons who could be expected to look to ambacs representations about its business in making an informed decision about whether to purchase or sell strats are part of the precise class for the protection of which the  act was enacted deutschman v beneficial corp  fd   d cir  indeed on the facts alleged i cannot imagine any other entity whose sec filings and public statements made to the press and to market analysts would have the slightest relevance to an informed decision to deal in the strats that are the subject of this lawsuit nothing in in re refco capital markets ltd brokerage customer sec litig  fsuppd   sdny  suggests that these plaintiffs ought not be accorded standing to sue ambac as plaintiffs note in their memorandum of law the plaintiffs in refco lacked standing because they neither purchased nor sold anything and nothing was purchased or sold on their behalf that is simply not the case here finally in blue chip stamps the supreme court held that policy considerations could properly be taken into account when deciding whether an entity has standing to sue under section b and rule b see  us at  relevant policy consideration supports allowing plaintiffs to sue ambac the primary purpose of the securities laws is to provide protection to investors see eg ernst  ernst v hochfelder  us    the development and evolution of new and complex financial instruments such as abs and rmbs and cdos created new challenges for investors who are trying to make informed decisions while scholars and commentators have called for a variety of new laws to deal with this development—with some even going so far as to suggest making subprime mortgages themselves subject to the federal securities laws and others suggesting a revision of blue chip stamps purchaser or sale requirement—we need not consider these and other interesting suggestions for expanding existing law because in our case we are dealing with instruments that are admittedly securities and that are already subject to federal law the issue for this court is whether it makes sense as a policy matter to allow purchasers of a derivative security to bring suit under section b and rule b against the firm whose assets have been securitized by a shell corporation on the theory that persons who purchased those securities were defrauded about their value not by some statement about the issuer but by inaccurate descriptions of the securitized assets that were made by the owner of those assets the question answers itself spvs like sfis have been described as essentially robot firms that are thinly capitalized and have no employees make no substantive economic decisions have no physical location and cannot go bankrupt gary gorton and nicholas s souleles special purpose vehicles and securitization in the risks of financial institutions  mark carey  rene stulz eds  by design the spv that issues the securities does not function as a separate independent entity except on paper its purpose it to serve as a passthrough vehicle for money going to corporations like ambac and securities and the risk they represent going to investors like plaintiffs plaintiffs could never recover anything from the spv so limiting the right to sue for misrepresentations in connection with the purchase of a derivative to the shell corporation that is technically the issuer means that the investing public has no recourse while underlying issuers like ambac—which benefited by passing off its risk to the investing public while being handsomely paid for doing so—are insulated from their own alleged frauds it is true that allowing plaintiffs to sue ambac expands the class of persons who can sue that company however i agree with judge schwarzer in zelman v jds uniphase corp  fsuppd  nd cal  that this expansion will not lead willynilly to a world in which any investor can sue any corporation on any cockandbull theory that the corporations public statements have affected some wholly unrelated security id at  nortel is still good law in this circuit so where the relationship between corporation as disclosures and corporation bs stock price is too remote corporation bs shareholders cannot sue corporation a under the antifraud provisions of the  act in this case however the relationship between ambacs disclosures and the strats is anything but remote as the sec regulations make clear therefore this court is perfectly comfortable in concluding that plaintiffs have standing to sue ambac if material misstatements made by that company illegally inflated the price of the strats that issued for benefit of ambac iii the pleading is otherwise sufficient with standing established it is clear that there is no basis on which to dismiss the instant complaint the basic elements of a cause of action for securities fraud under section b and rule b are  a material misstatement or omission  scienter  a

plaintiffs have clearly met their burden of identifying specific alleged fraudulent statements they have identified numerous specific statements and disclosures that they allege were fraudulent and identified who made them when they were made and why they were allegedly fraudulent as discussed above the alleged misstatements were made in connection with the purchase or sale of a security and plaintiffs have adequately pled that they relied on the alleged misstatements and suffered an economic loss further they have adequately pled loss causation plaintiffs have identified several corrective disclosures that allegedly demonstrated the falsity of defendants previous statements and have also alleged that the value of their securities declines following the corrective disclosures that is sufficient at the pleadings stage see dura pharm  us at  the only remaining issue is whether plaintiffs have adequately pled with sufficient particularity facts giving rise to a strong

scienter in most cases the most straightforward way to raise such an inference for a corporate defendant will be to plead it for an individual defendant id at  here plaintiffs have adequately pled specific facts that if proved raise the necessary strong inference as to both genader and leonard and consequently raised such an inference with regards to ambac plaintiffs have alleged that genaders compensation was tied to shortterm profits and that he actively took steps to increase those shortterm profits at the expense of prudential risk management for the purpose of increasing his own compensation plaintiffs also allege that genader was closely involved in the formulation of ambacs public statements and representations and that he knew they were materially misleading because it was at his behest that ambac was no longer adhering to the underwriting standards it was touting to the public these allegations are sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter as to defendant genader as for leonard plaintiffs have alleged in detail that he either made public statements or participated in conference calls in which he represented both that ambac was continuing to be conservative in its approach and that it was actively monitoring its own portfolio to ensure that general market woes were not negatively affecting ambac taking the allegations of the complaint as true then leonard either  knew facts or had access to information that ambacs public statements about its underwriting and risk management were inaccurate because ambac was not adhering to its historically conservative approach or  failed to check information he had a duty to monitor namely that ambac was in fact monitoring the mortgage portfolio that underlay its insurance and was accurately disclosing the risks inherent in that portfolio either of these scenarios raises a sufficiently strong inference of scienter as to defendant leonard see dynex capital  fd at  conclusion for

should be allowed to bring holder claims under b claims which have been disallowed since blue chip stamps id at  further winner argues that developments in both securities markets and securities law require the court to —examine the standing requirements for injured securities holders id at   obviously one must engage in a linedrawing exercise in order to decide whether issuer as securities are or are not so remote from issuer b as to preclude suit against issuer b by the holders of issuer as securities the inextricable intertwining of ambac with the strats makes this an easy case—it is hard to imagine a closer or less remote relationship—just as nortel strikes me as an easy case in the other direction it may not always be easy to figure out on which side of the remotenesscloseness line a situation falls but this court finds it unnecessary to make any blackandwhite pronouncement in order to dispose of the challenge here mounted to plaintiffs standing comment your name your email

involving venezuelan official the securities and exchange commission commission today charged four individuals with ties to a new york city brokerage firm in a scheme involving millions of dollars in illicit bribes paid to a highranking venezuelan finance official to secure the bond trading business of a stateowned venezuelan bank according to the sec’s complaint filed in federal court in manhattan the global markets group at brokerdealer direct access partners dap executed fixed income trades for customers in foreign sovereign debt  dap global generated more than  million in revenue for dap from transaction fees – in the form of markups and markdowns – on riskless principal trade executions in venezuelan sovereign or statesponsored bonds for banco de desarrollo económico y social de venezuela bandes  a portion of this revenue was illicitly paid to bandes vice president of finance maría de los ángeles gonzález de hernandez who authorized the fraudulent trades “these traders triggered a fraud that was staggering in audacity and scope” said andrew m calamari director of the sec’s new york regional office  “they thought they covered their tracks by using offshore accounts and a shadow accounting system to monitor their illicit profits and bribes but they underestimated the sec’s tenacity in piecing the scheme together” the sec’s complaint charges the following individuals for the roles in the kickback scheme tomas alberto clarke bethancourt who lives in miami and is an executive vice president at dap  known as “tomas clarke” he was responsible for executing the fraudulent trades and maintaining spreadsheets tracking the illicit markups and markdowns on those trades iuri rodolfo bethancourt who lives in panama and received more than  million in fraudulent proceeds from dap via his panamanian shell company which then paid gonzalez a portion of this amount jose alejandro hurtado who lives in miami and served as the intermediary between dap and gonzalez  hurtado was paid more than  million in kickbacks disguised as salary payments from dap and he remitted some of that money to gonzalez  haydee leticia pabon who is hurtado’s wife and received approximately  million in markups or markdowns on bandes trades that were funneled to her from dap in the form of sham finders’ fees in a parallel action the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york today announced criminal charges against gonzalez as well as clarke and hurtado according to the sec’s complaint the scheme began in october  and continued until at least june   bandes was a new customer to dap brought in by dap global executives through their connections to hurtado  as a result of the kickbacks to gonzalez dap obtained bandes’ lucrative trading business and provided gonzalez with the incentive to enter into trades with dap at considerable markups or markdowns without regard to the prices paid by bandes  gonzalez used her senior role at the caracasbased bank to ensure that its bond trades would continue to be steered to dap  as the scheme evolved over time the traders deceived dap’s clearing brokers executed internal wash trades interpositioned another brokerdealer in the trades to conceal their role in the transactions and engaged in massive roundtrip trades to pad their revenue  for example the sec alleges that in january  the traders and gonzalez arranged for two fraudulent roundtrip trades with bandes as both buyer and seller  these trades – which lacked any legitimate business purpose – caused bandes to pay dap more than  million in fees a portion of which was diverted to gonzalez for authorizing the blatantly fraudulent trades  the sec further alleges that giving rise to the adage of no honor among thieves clarke and hurtado frequently falsified the size of dap’s fees in their reports to gonzalez which enabled the traders to retain a greater share of the fraudulent profits the sec’s complaint charges clarke bethancourt hurtado and pabon with fraud and seeks final judgments that would require them to return illgotten gains with interest and pay financial penalties the sec’s investigation which is continuing was conducted by wendy tepperman amanda straub and michael osnato of the new york regional office  the sec’s litigation will be led by howard fischer  an sec examination of dap that that led to the investigation was conducted by members of the new york office’s brokerdealer examination staff  the sec appreciates the assistance of the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york and the federal bureau of investigation press rel  commission announces panelists for credit ratings roundtable the commission today announced the panelists for its credit ratings roundtable which will be

 about risk foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value value investing style risk a value investing style subjects the fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market as of

also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
