description “in the heart of africa” is a set of fastplay wargames rules for the period of exploration and imperial conquest in tropical africa chronologically this corresponds roughly to the second half of the th century while geographically it covers the region between the zambezi river in the south and the edge of the sahara desert in the north – the classic “darkest africa” of the explorers this has been a popular period for skirmishing role playing and conventional wargames this is not surprising as it has a number of unique advantages it rivals the ancient and medieval periods in the enormous variety of possible armies each with its own distinctive – and often spectacular – appearance it shares the “boy’s own adventure” atmosphere of ordinary colonial gaming but is far more interesting as a game the africans have more tactical options to choose from than the zulu or dervish charge while the europeans have a less decisive advantage in weaponry and unlike many exotic and colorful periods it is relatively well known and accessible with plenty of primary sources available in english – livingstone stanley and several others are still household names to this day the army lists covered in the main rule book are the native kingdom the native warlord the peaceful villagers the warrior herdsmen the jungle cannibals the pygmies the zanzibaris the sudanese slavers the portuguese settlers the white explorers the egyptians the colonial expedition reviews there are no reviews yet be the first to review “in the heart of africa nd edition pdf” cancel replyyou must be
