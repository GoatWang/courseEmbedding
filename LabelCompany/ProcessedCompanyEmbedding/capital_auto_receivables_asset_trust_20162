utilized by fitch to determine the base case loss proxy fitch utilized conservative    vintage securitization loss data from the daimlerchrysler auto trust dcat platform to derive a loss proxy for this portion of the pool the loss proxy has increased relative to a due to weaker performance observed on outstanding ccart transactions performance weakening the santander consumer usa inc sc and cc portfolios along with ccart securitizations recorded rising delinquencies and cumulative net losses cnl yearoveryear yoy through  and the second quarter of  fitch took this into account when deriving the b proxy ccart pools have certain prime borrower characteristics but fitch classifies the platform as midprime based on historical loss performance to date and thus applied midprime loss multiples in its analysis stable ccsc receivables mix cc originations total  of the pool while core sc nonprime originations total  consistent with recent pools fitch utilized conservative nonprime core sc loss data to derive a loss proxy for the core sc portion of the pool sufficient credit enhancement ce initial hard ce totals  for the class a notes down from  in a ce for the class b through d notes is also marginally lower versus a excess spread is  consistent with a ce is sufficient to cover fitchs  base case proxy and modeled net loss levels for all the notes consistent collateral pool the collateral is fairly consistent with prior pools the weighted average wa fico score is  wa loantovalue ltv is  and new vehicles total  commercial contracts which typically perform stronger than retails contracts total  of the pool the pools collateral characteristics comprise elements of prime and nonprime consumer credits increasing extendedterm loans loans with terms of plus months total  down from a and prior transactions however  to  month contracts total  of the pool the highest level observed to date for the platform fitch applied a stress to the loss proxy to account for the risk posed by these loans due to limited performance history and weaker loan attributes and credit quality stable corporate health sc has been profitable each year since  including recent years fitch rates santander majority owner of sc via santander holding usa inc shusa afstable outlook consistent originationunderwritingservicing along with its cc division sc demonstrates adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance fitch deems sc capable to service this series legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of sc would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to b to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses we saw a potential downgrade of one category under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories potentially leading to distressed ratings under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from deloitte  touche llp the

class a notes fsf outlook stable  classes a notes aaasf outlook stable  class a notes aaasf outlook stable  class a notes aaasf outlook stable  class b notes aasf outlook stable  class c notes asf outlook stable  class d notes bbbsf outlook stable key rating drivers limited performance history cc was founded in  thus performance data are limited and were not utilized by fitch to determine the base case loss proxy fitch utilized conservative    vintage securitization loss data from the daimlerchrysler auto trust dcat platform to derive a loss proxy for this portion of the pool the loss proxy has increased relative to a due to weaker performance observed on outstanding ccart transactions performance weakening the sc and cc portfolios along with ccart securitizations recorded rising delinquencies and cumulative net losses cnl yearoveryear yoy through  and the second quarter of  fitch took this into account when deriving the b proxy ccart pools have certain prime borrower characteristics but fitch classifies the platform as midprime based on historical loss performance to date and thus applied midprime loss multiples in its analysis stable ccsc receivables mix cc originations total  of the pool while core sc nonprime originations total  consistent with recent pools fitch utilized conservative nonprime core sc loss data to derive a loss proxy for the core sc portion of the pool sufficient credit enhancement ce initial hard ce totals  for the class a notes down from  in a ce for the class b through d notes is also marginally lower versus a excess spread is expected to be  consistent with a ce is sufficient to cover fitchs  base case proxy and modeled net loss levels for all the notes consistent collateral pool the collateral is fairly consistent with prior pools the wa fico score is  wa ltv is  and new vehicles total  commercial contracts which typically perform stronger than retails contracts total  of the pool the pools collateral characteristics comprise elements of prime and nonprime consumer credits increasing extendedterm loans loans with terms of plus months total  down from a and prior transactions however  month contracts total  of the pool the highest level observed to date for the platform fitch applied a stress to the loss proxy to account for the risk posed by these loans due to limited performance history and weaker loan attributes and credit quality stable corporate health sc has been profitable each year since  including recent years fitch rates santander majority owner of sc via shusa afstable outlook consistent originationunderwritingservicing along with its cc division sc demonstrates adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance fitch deems sc capable to service this series legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of sc would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to b to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses we saw a potential downgrade of one category under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories potentially leading to distressed ratings under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from deloitte  touche llp the thirdparty due diligence focused on comparing or recomputing certain
