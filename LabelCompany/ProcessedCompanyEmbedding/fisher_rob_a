team our focus has been on how natural systems are responding to the anthropocene and what types of resiliency they have or lack as it relates to maintaining ecological integrity and biodiversity additionally through understanding individual species and community responses to perturbations through modern monitoring techniques we can determine appropriate management experiments or options to possibly recover resiliency geographically we have two foci the first is southern california where urbanization and conservation planning bring various direct and indirect drivers of ecological change and climate variability is currently extreme and drives landscape level drought and wildfires our second foci are the tropical islands of the pacific basin from palau and papua new guinea east to hawai’i these islands have also been driven by human change and are on the front line as extreme recent weather variability in the cyclone belt impact terrestrial ecosystems understanding how biodiversity was generated in this ecoregion is critical to managing its loss and our team focuses across time and space biogeography to understand these processes utilizing molecular tools tied to
