adults november   bookwomanjoan oak harbor wa age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  how important is a best friend to you we know deep friendships are important but townsend says many people do not know how to form them many people are isolated and have learned to live with just shallow friendships some just dont have the skill and abilities to go deep others put their energy into the opposite sex or family members townsend has written this book to help you with friendship in general and particularly those few deep friendships he wants you to experiences the highest level of good from our friendships townsend clarifies what he means by friend involving knowing liking and presence they are people with whom you entrust yourself youll need more than one person to provide all of the qualities you need different people have different strengths to offer he has caution and advice for pursuing friends of the opposite sex he explains that friendships need maintenance or will suffer and decline townsend believes that most best friendships are being underutilized not providing for either what they could with exploration and effort the friendship can be maximized townsend says your spouse as your only best friend is not enough we were not designed to have one person meet our deepest needs we were designed for community  townsend explains how to connect with people how to deepen the attachment such as venting talking about core values he also gives suggestions with respect to helping your friends not give them excuses for their behavior he writes about the social media world such as facebook and its role in friendship it may be great for updates but not for confrontations or serious dialogue townsend writes about relational honesty you are first to be truthful about yourself you are to be truthful about the other person he writes about fighting  the right way of healing he says time plus relationship and truth can heal just about everything  he has recommendations for creating an honest environment time is essential best friendships require time to grow and produce the great relationships we need  townsend says it is not good to have only family as best friends love your home love your family but you were designed to let nonfamily members into the deeper recesses of your heart and life  do all you can to befriend those in your family who will be the kind of friends townsend has described but beyond that he says make sure you are connected to people outside the comfort zone of your family  he ends his book with a challenge best friends are powerful because you have made yourself vulnerable they can be lifechanging positively or negatively the same goes for your influence on them choose your words carefully pay attention to their care there is a discussion guide at the end of the book although the advanced egalley i received did not have it included this short book is packed with encouragement and ideas for creating and sustaining best friends teens and young adults would certainly benefit from this book i received an advanced egalley of this book from worthy publishing for the purpose of this review was this review helpful
