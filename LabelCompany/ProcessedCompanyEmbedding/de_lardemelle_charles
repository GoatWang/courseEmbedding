eagle funds title portfolio manager charles edouard de lardemelles experience title portfolio manager founding partner company international value advisers llc job details we manage our clients assets with a dual attempt that is unusual in the shortterm  months our attempt is to try to preserve capital while in the longerterm  years ie over a full economic cycle we attempt to perform better than equity indices the msci all country world index in the case of our global strategy and the msci all country world exus index in the case of our international strategy the global strategy is typically used by investors who are looking for an all weather fund where we are given the latitude to decide how much we should have invested in the us versus outside the us the international strategy is typically used by investors who practice asset allocation and want to decide for themselves how much should be allocated to a domestic manager and how much should be allocated to a pure international ie nonus manager yet at the same time are looking for a lower risk  and lower volatility  exposure to international markets than may be obtained from a more traditional international fund we believe our investment approach is very different from the traditional approach of most investment managers we are trying to deliver returns that are as absolute as possible ie returns that try to be as resilient as possible in down markets while many of our competitors try to deliver good relative performance ie try to beat a benchmark and thus would be fine with being down  if their benchmark is down  why do we have such an unusual strategy which incidentally is not easy to carry out because we believe this strategy makes sense for many investors we are fond of the quote by mark twain there are two times in a mans life when he should not speculate the first time is when he cannot afford to the second time is when he can we realize that many investors cannot tolerate high volatility and appreciate that lifes bills do not always come at market tops this strategy also appeals to us at international value advisers since we eat our own cooking for a significant part of our savings invested in iva products and we have an extreme aversion to losing money title portfolio manager company first eagle funds job details company size less than  mil  employee range less than  additional
