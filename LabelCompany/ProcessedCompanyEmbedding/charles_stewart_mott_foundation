community organizing by crc staff march    comments charles stewart mott foundation from community service to community organizing by kirk macdonald foundation watch march  pdf available here fw     summary antiamerican filmmaker michael moore may be the most famous celebrity from flint michigan but he has not made the greatest impact on his community that honor would go to the philanthropist charles stewart mott whose foundation is a major donor to flint area charities mr mott believed in strong communities but it is unlikely that he believed in the political strategy of “community organizing” as it’s practiced today what would mott think of the advocacy groups and activist training academies that promote the concept of “community organizing”—and that get funding from mott’s foundation   the charles stewart mott foundation is a large and wellestablished philanthropic foundation and like many of its kind it gives large sums of money to organizations of the left the foundation funds the hardleft tides center  since  and tides foundation  since  it supports the carnegie endowment for international peace  since  the george sorosendowed open society institute  since  and the children’s defense fund established by marian wright edelman  since  the jimmy carter center receives mott grants  in  and so does the united nations foundation  in  some philanthropic foundations as different as soros’s leftist open society institute and the conservative lynde and harry bradley foundation support projects that represent the intentions of their donors but too many foundations pursues goals contrary to any reasonable interpretation of their founders’ intent surely that is the case with the charles stewart mott foundation the donor charles stewart mott died in flint on feb   he was  years old mott’s life embodied the great era of american entrepreneurship that culminated in a commitment to community and philanthropy mott was born in newark new jersey on june   his grandfather founded mott’s apple juice and his father owned a struggling axlemaking company that became successful after mott moved its operations to flint mott sold the company to general motors corp in  and became a company vice president he accepted payment in gm stock which made him the company’s largest individual stockholder a conservative republican mott was a threetime mayor of flint in the following decade and ran unsuccessfully for governor of michigan in  his investments in a profitable automobile company during the booming s made him a very wealthy man and in  he established a family foundation endowing it with gm stock worth  mott committed himself to the betterment of his community he established medical and dental clinics for local children and gave to the boy scouts and ymca in  the mott foundation partnered with flint public schools to provide schoolbased educational and recreational activities for adults and children yearround and in the evenings this became the model for the socalled “community education” movement which spread across the nation mott’s financial contributions to flint were so great that some of his contemporaries quipped that he should have renamed the city mott something of a pennypincher mott ran his foundation as a oneman show wrote historian waldemar nielsen in his  book the golden donors mott selected the foundation’s investments picked the grantees and personally wrote out the checks in  mott gave his foundation  million in gm stock mott received many honors in his final years president eisenhower named him international big brother of the year for improving the lives of young people he received the american legion’s medal for distinguished service and he was honored by the american federation of labor the american schools and colleges association the michigan society of professional engineers and the michigan legislature the mott foundation did not produce an annual report until  the year of its founder’s death the foundation’s mission statement sums up the character of its philanthropy “we recognize that our obligation to fellow men does not stop at the boundaries of the community in an even larger sense every man is in partnership with the rest of the human race in the eternal conquest which we call civilization” mott’s family and foundation at the end of  the charles stewart mott foundation reported assets of nearly  billion it is the th largest us foundation while it continues to make substantial contributions to community organizations in the flint area ninety grants totaling  million in  the foundation’s grantmaking has gone national and international  grants totaling  million in  unfortunately like so many large foundations in the late s and s the charles stewart mott foundation began to embrace the causes of the left over time the foundation’s staff grew large over  in  and was “professionalized” and its board was expanded to include new people who had no recollection of the founder or his views on giving charles stewart mott became the name of the foundation not the memory of the man the donor’s beliefs and intentions were further undermined by one of his sons stewart rawlings mott  one of the most famous liberal heirs of the s stewart mott tried to influence the grantmaking at his father’s foundation at the same time that he established a separate foundation the stewart r mott charitable trust later foundation mott’s widow ruth rawlings mott created the ruth mott foundation stewart mott and his elderly father were not close stewart studied engineering at massachusetts institute of technology but then hitchhiked around the world for a year he then switched to columbia university studying the liberal arts while living on a chinese junk “after graduating from columbia university in  stewart stirred up his first controversy when he returned to flint michigan and established a planned parenthood birth control clinic” wrote author david callahan “soon he was fighting with his father as he tried to push the family foundation – the charles stewart mott foundation – in a more liberal direction” see fortunes of change the rise of the liberal rich and the remaking of america wiley  stewart created advocacy groups including one called people’s politics which promoted leftwing activism on race and civil liberties and women’s issues he wanted to reform the pentagon and funded two groups the project on military procurement and the farleft center for defense information mott’s capitol hill mansion on maryland avenue in washington dc became a fundraising salon for his causes he delighted in rejecting his michigan roots took pride in not driving a gm car and once donated  to a group in detroit that was trying to prevent gm from building a new auto plant stewart rawlings mott listed himself as a “philanthropist” in the manhattan telephone directory his preferred selfdescription “avantgarde philanthropist” wouldn’t fit in the space available stewart was a guiltridden leftist who felt burdened by his personal wealth “i spend on myself what i think i could have earned and after taxes i give everything else away that’s how i make peace with my conscience” the son gave money to promote research on extrasensory perception esp arms control and civil liberties gay rights and feminism birth control abortion and sex research he gave generously to sen eugene mccarthy’s  bid to replace president lyndon johnson and he was the largest single donor to sen george mcgovern who tried to unseat president richard nixon in  nixon’s white house counsel charles colson put the younger mott on nixon’s “enemies list” saying of him “nothing but big money for radiclib candidates” the foundation today the philanthropy of the cs mott foundation focuses increasingly today on national and international grantmaking it contributes to social justice nonprofits groups building civil society in central and eastern europe and south africa and environmental organizations in  thirty percent of mott grants— grants totaling  million—went to its division called “pathways out of poverty” the mott annual report describes one of these “pathways” in ways saul alinsky would have approved the goal “to enhance the power and effectiveness of the community–organizing field in order to strengthen and sustain the involvement of low–income communities in shaping their futures” the objective “strong and effective community–organizing networks at the national regional and state levels that foster community engagement and positive change in poor communities” the foundation devotes much of its resources to advancing these alinskyinspired community organizing groups among its grantees are the center for community change a whopping  since  national council of la raza  since  the acornaffiliated american institute for social justice  since  the national training and information center  since  pacific institute for community organization  since  the gamaliel foundation  since  local initiatives support corporation  since  the alinskyfounded industrial areas foundation  since  midwest academy  since  and interfaith worker justice  since  the foundation also funds environmental groups among them are nature conservancy  since  friends of the earth  since  world resources institute  since  environmental defense fund  since  and sierra club foundation  since  mottfunded think tanks include the liberal aspen institute  since  and center on budget and policy priorities  since  the labor union affiliated economic policy institute  since  the far left institute for policy studies  since  and the alan guttmacher institute which is the research arm of planned parenthood  in  helping alinskyite groups like so many other leftwing philanthropies the charles stewart mott foundation unquestioningly accepts the virtue of community organizing groups inspired by rules for radicals author saul alinsky the foundation funds the inyourface tactics of modern community organizing no fan of the political right alinsky once remarked that “radicals are most adept at breaking the necks of conservatives” since  the foundation has given almost  million to the thuggish gamaliel foundation which advocates for open borders immigration governmentsubsidized housing and nationalized health care as capital research center author david hogberg writes gamaliel targets local churches in inner cities organizing their congregations to fight political battles in their communities many of the “community organizations” it helps to create become effective local powerbrokers that win battles to increase local and state spending for health transportation and welfare entitlements guided by a belief that the ends justify the means gamaliel is willing to practice deception to win the confidence of local church pastors for purposes they would not approve helping the poor is part of the mission of innercity churches but the mission of the gamaliel foundation is to advance a farleft political agenda that provides little benefit to the poor churches openly proclaim their mission but gamaliel operates by using stealth tactics foundation watch july  the mott foundation has given  million to the acornaffiliated american institute for social justice aisj which collapsed after acorn filed for bankruptcy in late  published the magazine social review and trained community organizers in the art of political agitation since  mott has given  to the industrial areas foundation iaf a group with dozens of affiliates nationwide and overseas that was founded by saul alinsky alinsky referred to iaf’s training institute as a “school for professional radicals” it works to mobilize church congregations using its own organizers to turn the church into a powerful advocacy organization that will deploy the sanctity of religion to demonize and shame its adversaries the chicagobased midwest academy has gotten  from mott since  established by heather and paul booth the academy trains radical activists heather booth was herself trained at iaf she has been a highranking democratic party operative and has established a number of activist organizations including the scandalridden citizen action and its successor organization usaction paul booth was a founder and former national secretary of students for a democratic society the s era antiwar group he is now an aide to gerald mcentee president of the powerful public sector union afscme the mott foundation has made its largest financial commitment of almost  million since  to the center for community change another nonprofit recruitment and training center for political activists the mission of ccc which is headed by acorn alumnus deepak bhargava is “to build the power and capacity of lowincome people especially lowincome people of color to change their communities and public policies for the better” ccc says it aims to create “vibrant communitybased organizations led by the people most affected by social and economic injustice” to assist “neglected populations” to put “an end to the failed ‘on your own’ mentality of the political right” and to institute “a new politics based on community values” interfaith worker justice since  the cs mott foundation has donated a smaller sum——to interfaith worker justice iwj but like its grants to other community organizing groups mott jumpstarts radical activism in local communities by ”raising consciousness” in religious communities and labor unions according to discoverthenetworksorg founded in  interfaith worker justice iwj is a chicagobased faith coalition that advocates what it terms “worker justice” which is the labor equivalent of social and economic justice iwj’s progressive agenda intertwines the global growth of new labor’s power with openborders immigration policy in the united states the organization sees itself as promoting the welfare of both domestic and foreign workers iwj was created by its executive director kim bobo a longtime trainer for the midwest academy she also helped to write the academy’s training manual working in partnership with the aflcio iwj has created a national network of more than  interfaith committees student groups and workers’ centers according to discoverthenetworks the genesis for the partnership was bobo’s meeting with aflcio president john sweeney which was arranged through her connection with msgr jack egan a cofounder of the catholic campaign for human development a funder of “direct action” community groups and a former board member of alinsky’s industrial areas foundation iwj also works with rev jim wallis’s faith in public life fpl network and with the los angelesbased clergy and laity united for economic justice clue clue has created the new sanctuary movement nsm a coalition of openborders groups that helps illegal immigrants facing deportation iwj claims that “militarystyle workplace raids” unfairly “discriminate against people who appear ‘foreign’” “tear families and communities apart” and “are counterproductive at a time of economic crisis” bobo and iwj are also in the forefront of the effort to unionize walmart in  and  iwj advocated for the misnamed employee free choice act efca which would deprive union members of secretballot voting by substituting “cardcheck” authorization bobo describes efca as “a moral imperative and a civil and human right” that would help “level the playing field in the workplace” it is iwj’s position that as people of faith we believe that walmart should be a good employer and a good neighbor all of our faith traditions – christian jewish muslim – have statements urging employers to pay wages that can support families provide benefits for families ensure that workers are treated with respect and dignity on the job guarantee workers’ right to organize and challenge sweatshops at home and abroad conclusion during his long life charles stewart mott was an exemplary philanthropist he strongly supported efforts to improve community and civic life but he understood these concepts differently than the current program officers at the charles stewart mott foundation it’s too bad that for them “community organizing” is a paid occupation for radical activists kirk macdonald is a canadian freelance writer fw         is acorn trying to rig the  election by matthew vadum the obama administration is working closely with acorn to give democrats an unfair advantage in the november elections newly uncovered government documents suggest former acorn attorney estelle h rogers now director of advocacy at acornaffiliated project vote has been collaborating with the obama white house and the department of justice to step up enforcement of the national voting rights act nvra also known as the motorvoter law doj has been criticized for refusing to enforce section  of nvra which requires states to remove the names of ineligible felons the dead and nonresidents from voter rolls rogers wants more vigorous enforcement of section  which requires states to register voters at welfare offices welfare recipients are inclined to support democrats project vote founder sanford newman acknowledges his group’s work helps the left almost exclusively as i reported in my book subversion inc “while our work is nonpartisan it is realistic to assume that upward of  percent of the people we register on unemployment and other social service distribution lines will oppose politicians who have supported cuts in the programs on which they rely” he said “they are likely to vote democratic in most instances” project vote is the unit of the infamous acorn network that president obama worked for in  when he ran a successful voter drive in illinois that helped to cement his status as a rising star of the activist left obama trained acorn activists and represented acorn in court as the group’s lawyer project vote believes voter fraud is nothing to be worried about according to emails released to judicial watch under the freedom of information act rogers wrote doj official robert weiner on feb   asking him to “make some headway with attorney general eric holder in enforcing section  of the nvra” in the email rogers writes it is “deeply disappointing” that doj had not yet filed any section  lawsuits rogers also writes that “we have received oral assurances from assistant attorney general thomas perez on several occasions that enforcement action was imminent” less than a month later the doj filed the first such lawsuit against rhode island on march   rogers wrote doj official thomas perrelli asking him to review and “make improvements” to a document she was sending following another meeting held on march   between project vote and the doj on section  compliance in an earlier email dated april   rogers wrote to doj official sam hirsh about a meeting scheduled for three days later attendees included cecelia muñoz thenwhite house director of intergovernmental affairs and recently promoted to director of the domestic policy council muñoz was previously chairman of the farleft center for community change a saul alinskyinspired group similar to acorn she was also on the us programs board of george soros’s open society institute and on the board of atlantic philanthropies which until recently was run by soros protégé gara lamarche other attendees were project vote official nicole kovite zeitler whose job is to lobby for stronger enforcement of section  of the nvra also attending were spencer overton deputy assistant attorney general in the office of legal policy and tino cuellar special assistant to the president for justice and regulatory policy in a previous document dump judicial watch discovered that rogers was involved in the doj hiring process in multiple emails from  rogers recommends prospective employees to a doj official last year at least five acorn leaders visited the white house rogers visited on march   according to the white house visitors database she met with shasti conrad a senior aide to obama adviser valerie jarrett

corporation that ran acorn’s network of  affiliated groups filed bankruptcy in  after ordering its state chapters to incorporate themselves separately in order to carry on acorn’s work acorn front

httprdffreebasecomnsmeasurementunitdatedpercentage  if youre writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
