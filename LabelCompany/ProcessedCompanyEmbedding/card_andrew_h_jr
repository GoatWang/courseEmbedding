said today that the administration was following a meticulously planned strategy to persuade the public the congress and the allies of the need to confront the threat from saddam husseinthe rollout of the strategy this week they said was planned long before president bushs vacation in texas last month it was not hastily concocted they insisted after some prominent republicans began to raise doubts about moving against mr hussein and administration officials made contradictory statements about the need for weapons inspectors in iraqthe white house decided they said that even with the appearance of disarray it was still more advantageous to wait until after labor day to kick off their planfrom a marketing point of view said andrew h card jr the white house chief of staff who is coordinating the effort you dont introduce new products in august advertisement continue reading the main story a centerpiece of the strategy white house officials said is to use mr bushs speech on sept  to help move americans toward support of action against iraq which could come early next year continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story everybody felt that was a moment that americans wanted to hear from him said karl rove mr bushs chief political adviser sept  will also be a time mr rove said to seize the moment to make clear what lies aheadtoward that end in june the white house picked ellis island in new york harbor not governors island as the place where president bush is to deliver his sept  address to the nation both spots were considered white house advisers said but the television camera angles were more spectacular from ellis island where the statue of liberty will be seen aglow behind mr bushwe had made a decision that this would be a compelling story either place said dan bartlett the white house communications director we sent a team out to go and look and they said this is a better shot and we said okin the same way mr bushs sept  remarks about  minutes in length are to serve as the emotional precursor for a tougher speech about iraq that the president is to deliver to the united nations general assembly the following daythe fact is theres a pretty abysmal relationship between saddam hussein and the united nations said mr bartlett who added that mr hussein had flouted everything the un has stood forthe president is going to be very direct and articulate a history of defiance mr bartlett saidboth speeches are in final drafts although mr bush spent time reviewing the united nations speech on thursday night on air force one as he returned to washington from indiana hes trimming it up so its in his cadence mr rove said advertisement continue reading the main story the sept  speech a half hour or less in length was written by a team that included mr bushs chief speechwriter michael gerson condoleezza rice the national security adviser secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld and secretary of state colin l powell the sept  speech was written by mr gerson and karen p hughes the former counselor who still closely advises mr bush from texason capitol hill meanwhile the administration has begun a fullscale lobbying campaign on the day after labor day the opening of washingtons political new year mr bush summoned a skeptical congressional leadership to the white house to enlist their support for action

tenet gave evidence on iraqi military capacity to the top four congressional leaders some of whom have said the administration has provided no proof that the threat from mr hussein is imminentthat was thought of as a necessary step as was having the leadership down as was the necessity of providing a higher level of intelligence mr rove saidanother senior administration official said the white house lobbying campaign on capitol hill would include notsosubtle mentions of the regrets experienced by those lawmakers like former senator sam nunn who did not vote for the  use of force resolution before the persian gulf warthe white house wants a resolution approving the use of force in iraq to be approved in the next four to five weeksin the end it will be difficult for someone to vote against it the administration official saidwhite house officials said they began planning more intensively for the iraq rollout in july advisers consulted the congressional calendar to figure out the best time for iraq hearings while ms hughes even as she was driving back to texas discussed with mr bush the outlines of his sept  speechby august with congress out of town and the united nations not convening until september white house officials decided to wait out the month even as final planning continued by phone between advisers in washington and at mr bushs ranch in texas advertisement

officials refused to say today whether mr bush would build on his united nations speech and directly address the nation about his planned course in iraq stay tuned mr bartlett saidbut some republicans said that a speech to the nation was inevitable and necessaryat some time theyre going to have to talk directly to the people said michael k deaver president ronald reagans longtime communications
