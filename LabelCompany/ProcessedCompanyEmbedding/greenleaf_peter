morey stettner  reprints like many ceos peter greenleaf knows that disagreements will inevitably arise among smart driven executives he says the best leaders serve as aligners who bring people together to pursue a shared vision even if they hold different views on how to get there greenleaf  became chief executive of sucampo pharmaceuticals scmp in march  a a year later he and his executive team discussed the bethesda mdbased biopharmaceutical firms strategy there was some debate over how we were building the company greenleaf recalled part of that was our acquisition strategy should we look at accretive deals that build our financial stability or dilutive deals that take longer but strengthen our drug pipeline the leadership team consisting of eight execs split evenly on the issue facing what greenleaf calls a strategic bifurcation the ceo resolved the matter by convening an offsite meeting we got together with just this one agenda item for one full day he said we werent going to leave the room until we had alignment the group decided to pursue accretive deals four months after that meeting sucampo announced an allcash tender offer to acquire rtech ueno a japanese pharmaceutical firm he praises his team for not just reaching agreement on what to do but also following through rapidly he credits the groups ability to engage in respectful discussion listen well and trust each other workers become owners with roughly  employees sucampo makes amitiza for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome after the company was founded in  and had some success greenleaf came aboard in  as a change agent to propel sucampos growth in his first six months as ceo greenleaf overhauled the management team he retained key insiders while bringing in newcomers many of whom he knew from his past jobs in the pharmaceutical industry people were joining a company with somewhat dated success he said our goforward strategy was totally different greenleaf and his new leadership team instituted an employee stockoption plan most of the workforce now doubles as owners we put a lot of time and attention into drafting the right longterm ownership plan he said the message is youre part of this company and your future rides on it see the vision to boost employee engagement greenleaf sought everyones input on the firms mission and values staffers completed online surveys and met in groups to hash out what they felt the company should stand for our employees helped create it and craft it into a statement that everyone can believe in greenleaf said he learned earlier in his career the importance of articulating and pursuing an ambitious vision as a product marketing manager at centocor biotech in the late s greenleaf helped convince the firms leaders and its board of directors of the marketing potential of a promising drug remicade that had hit regulatory headwinds we were tenacious in presenting our proposal he said and we were able to take remicade from concept to launch to help patients it became a  billion drug and i was fortunate to be able to set the vision and stay long enough — for six years — to see it through every year you have to go back and sell
