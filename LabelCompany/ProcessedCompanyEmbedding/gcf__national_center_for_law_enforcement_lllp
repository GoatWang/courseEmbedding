strategies conceived or in process of conception to reverse deforestation and degradationthe provincial government of west kalimantan has adopted three principles strategies for the development and implementation of redd these being  reducing deforestation through continuous improvement in local government policies and institutions including law enforcement and management of technical implementation units upt’s current upts already established include the upt on forest inventory and mapping land and forest fire control unit the national parks unit the institute for watershed management the forest resources conservation center the institute for monitoring of forest production and the forestry information center   creating incentives for better forest management and removing incentives that lead to deforestation from private parties who exploit natural resources that belong to the public  establish a green investment award to companies in the field of forestry plantation agriculture and mining in implementing zero burning and reduced impact logging ril policies establish a mechanism for environmental assessment through an integrated team consisting of ngos

forestry planninginstitutional framework content currently unavailable content currently unavailable content currently unavailable redd safeguards overview social rights  tenure transparency  participation benefits sharing environmental biodiversity ecosystem services target population and rights recognitionsocial groups reached by the redd program and number of people directly benefitedthe social groups targeted for outreach by the redd program are a indigenous peoples who have traditional ownership rights to land  forest areas impacted by the redd program and  social groups who may or may not be indigenous peoples who directly impact the land  forest areas through their daily activities both legal and illegal ie collecting firewood logging conversion to agriculture grazing other social groups include those who rely on the supply of forest products to support their own industry ie smallscale logging mills  manufacturers agricultural industry supply of meat in this way the redd program is aimed at benefiting those social groups who directly impact the forest and those groups who act as part of the ‘supplychain’ of forest products the number of people directly benefiting is not able to be quantified at this time because the program itself is still under development  implementation phase characterized by pilot projects identified in point    procedures taken by proponent and evidence that redd program acknowledges the rights and role of indigenous peoples and local communitiesin west kalimantan the west kalimantan malay customary council the council of indigenous dayak and the ethnic alliance are both active and respected entities it is together with these entities that the government is active in capacity building technical assistance and technology transfer with the goal that social institutions can be strengthened in line with government institutions in order to strengthen the ability to calculate carbon stocks and establishment of a forestry database in order to effectively implement communitybased forest management  it is envisaged that redd will be able to preserve a balanced forest function in terms of economy and ecology while directly benefiting both local and global communities needs identified for rights recognition improvementthere is a need for analysis of current legal frameworks national and regional to address rights recognition incorporating land and carbon ownerships rights in particular as relates to local and indigenous communities and regional and special autonomy laws  this framework would need to be harmonized across provincial and central government regulations landforest tenure administration and relation with reddlegal support and protection of forest tenureas outlined in benefits sharing currently the only way to establish forest tenure which could be used to develop either voluntary or compliance redd projects ie establish long term carbon rights is via the central government regulated system of land tenure licenses  permits  clear responsibilities capacity and authority for forest tenure administrationauthorities are devolved from the national forestry law and regulated by the system of land tenure licenses  permits outlined previously in all cases permits granted by the governor  regent bupati are subject to approval  recommendation by the minister subsequently in almost all cases the final authority for forest tenure comes in the form of a ministerial decree forest utilization license in the case of forestbased activities issued by the minister of forestry or land use permits for oil palm issued by the minister of agriculture  actions planned or developed by governments to solve issues related to land tenure uncertainties within redd priority areas  to be definedrelation of forest tenure solving and redd objectivesactionsthe relation between forest tenure and redd is central to redd objectives  actions and importantly being one of the objectives equitable benefits sharing as the process to establish tenure is reflected in the parties receiving benefits under the current mechanism this point is also reflected in national vs regional redd objectives in the sense that the current focus on meeting national emissions reductions should not be at the expense of meeting regional development the harmonization of these factors is inherent in the provincial spatial plan although the impact of the impending norwaybacked moratorium will also need to be addressed in terms of redd objectives  actions and the impact of the moratorium on tenure recognition of communities and indigenous peoples’ rightsthe recognition of communities and indigenous people’s rights is considered a top priority within provincial redd development it is also an extremely complex issue given its relationship to the national forestry law and lack of clarity regarding recognition of traditional rights in the indonesian legal context it is widely hoped that through development of fpic mechanisms the recognition of community and indigenous people’s rights will be able to be strengthened  participation of communities and indigenous peoples in forest tenure definitionforest tenure definition is established by the forestry law  in  forestry ministry central government under this law community  indigenous forest is incorporated as a subset of state national forest there are various ngo’s and community groups active in lobbying this definition and asserting stronger participation of communities and indigenous people’s groups in this definition and its impact on redd and redd’s alternatives definition of legal aspects related to property and rights to forest carbon in redd project areasas outlined in benefits sharing property rights ie rights to land are administered by the central government and are required prior to establishing rights to forest carbon under regulation p currently voluntary redd project developers are using ‘utilisation of wood forest produce’ iuphhk licenses to establish carbon rights although none have yet sold verified carbon credits and it is widely agreed although not yet established that legislated community hutan rakyat and indigenous ownership hutan adat both by ministerial decree could be used to establish both property and carbon rights for communities under a voluntary scheme conflict resolution measures in place  to be definedneeds identified  to be determined transparency and participation mechanismswhat actions have been taken to guarantee free prior and informed consent  to be definedbriefly describes mechanisms for consultation and continuous participation addressedgiven that more than  of the socioeconomic conditions in west kalimantan are dependent on the forests and resultant ecosystem services the government has taken the initiative to ensure as much as possible the participation of local communities and their representatives in addition to working with the west kalimantan malay customary council the council of indigenous dayak and the ethnic alliance the government of west kalimantan has encouraged consultation and participation via the following activities development of strategic natural assessment klhs and watershed forum das with multistakeholder involvement including ngo’s communities media universities professional associations and service agencies forest rangers pamhut comprised of indigenous people to secure forest in several districts engagement of the ‘redd community’ in order to achieve this the government is engaged with a number of ngos including oedas who are assisting in coordinating activities and building on opportunities which will be available to local communities including pilot models information on transparency of redd programtransparency is built upon the efforts to the west kalimantan government as outlined aboveneeds identified for improvement in participation and transparency  to be determined benefit sharing mechanismsdescribe the broad picture of how redd program addresses social and economic wellbeing of forest dependent communities currently the redd program is seeking to find the best ways through which to address the social and economic wellbeing of forest dependent communities fpic is a key part of this but so too is certainty on national policy and international carbon markets without certainty on carbon markets and supporting national regulations it will not be possible to say that redd can address the economic well being of forest dependent communities as it will not be possible to value the communities principle ‘asset’ carbon naturally social and economic wellbeing are interlinked with pathways to support social wellbeing needing to be supported by economic drivers  mechanisms description of the pes or benefit sharing mechanisms currently in place or planned concrete elementscurrently the only legislated benefit sharing mechanism in indonesia is as outlined in forestry ministry decree pmenhutii central government which stipulates the procedures for granting business license for the utilization of absorption andor storage of carbon in production forest and protected forests this license must be held in order to establish carbon rights and cannot be held as an independent license – it must be held in addition to a separate license outlined in the below table as permits through which the licenseholder establishes an underlying right to the land itself the first  license types are ‘utilisation of wood forest produce’ iuphhk licenses including natural forest logging ha plantation forests ht ecosystem restoration re – note this can also be used for pes and community plantation forest htr points  refer to legislated community and indigenous ownership note this ownership is not inherent  automatic – community  indigenous groups would need to attain mini terial decree in order to establish a legal right to the land which could be used to ascertain carbon rights under p with the possible exception of papua and aceh although this is ongoing note that p is currently under review pending additional input from the ministry for finance no distributions have as yet been made under this scheme describe evidences for participation of stakeholders in the development of the mechanismsp was widely hailed as the first benefit sharing mechanism legislated by any national government however it is widely considered that the mechanism could have benefitted further from more comprehensive stakeholder participation both from within government itself and affected stakeholder groups as mentioned above this regulation is currently under review  needs identified  a comparison of different benefit sharing mechanisms being discussed  developed internationally this would be most effectively done by coordination of the gcf secretariat with gcf members important points would include more detailed analysis of the realities of potential beneficiaries ie ‘on the ground’ and technical mechanisms on the checks and balances on the flow of redd funds and benefitsenvironmentalecosystem servicesone of the potential

article analysis green climate fund steps up to reduce deforestation and forest degradation key insights from the th meeting of the gcf board in songdo korea share tweet  shares  stephen leonard svleo friday  jul  shares  related stories progress and preservation – a dichotomous struggle is redd playing fair the cost of missed opportunities forests people and data south korea  the green climate fund gcf recently adopted two new decisions intended to reduce global emissions from deforestation and forest degradation as well as to support forest restoration and conservation in developing countries via redd these two new decisions relate to the gcf’s role in financing development of policies and preparatory activities in developing countries and the gcf’s policy related to making payments for verified emission reductions achieved through such policies and measures  context of the gcf it has been a long trek to get to this point at the international level the work on redd started as early as  and the international framework was finalized between  and  the un climate convention standing committee on finance has more recently been undertaking work to move the finance discussion forward since  and much groundwork has been done through initiatives led by the world bank undp unep and the fao such as the forest carbon partnership facility and the unredd programme since efforts to curb forest loss and restore and conserve forests commenced through redd there has been more than usd  billion provided to countries across asia africa and central and south america mostly on behalf of the governments of norway germany the uk and the us now more funding likely several hundreds of millions of usd is expected to come from the gcf however despite all these efforts only one country brazil has been able to show a decrease in deforestation but this trend has been reversed with a recent growth in deforestation the complexities associated with redd and its lack of emissions reductions results has thus caused many to question the potential for the framework to mitigate climate change attempts to achieve these objectives by relying on private sector finance and carbon markets negligible to nonexistent have been marred with controversy associated with on the ground realities of rights of indigenous peoples and local communities these tensions remain with deep divides persisting on topics such as carbon markets offsets lack of respect for indigenous rights and continued uncertainty related to land tenure in many countries despite this slowing halting and reversing forest cover and carbon loss remains a global priority the un sustainable development goal  seeks to achieve this by  reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and restoring and conserving forests was also identified as a priority action in the paris agreement the global community is wellaware of the importance of forests to the climate change agenda and heavy reliance is being placed on forest and land use to achieve the goals outlined by the paris agreement gcf relating to early phases of redd the first decision made at the recent th meeting of the gcf board in songdo korea addressed the type of support to be provided by the gcf to enact the enabling conditions policies and measures required to support phases  and  of redd redd redd resultsbased finance the multibillion dollar fund will support countries to develop strategies and action plans reference levels to measure emissions forest monitoring systems and safeguard systems as well as land tenure reform and will put emphasis on issues related to gender indigenous peoples rights and environmental integrity the gcf intends to makes it a priority to enhance countries’ capacities to safeguard the rights of local and indigenous communities and to seek strict adherence to social and environmental safeguards the gcf says it will ensure relevant stakeholders and civil society groups are consulted with particular attention paid to the rights of indigenous peoples it will focus on investments that build local and longlasting capacities and stakeholder engagement processes the gcf will support projects and programs which target the following previously forested lands to reduce pressure on forests by increasing productivity of agricultural lands through more efficient and proven technologies reforestation and agroforestry and restoration of natural forests managed forests targeting forests in proximity to the agricultural frontier this may come in the form of sustainable forest management for timber or non‐timber forest products payments for ecosystem services and ecotourism and primary forests recognizing land tenure rights strengthening law enforcement measures creating large‐scale protected areas maintaining the livelihoods and cultural values of forest‐dependent people and long‐term conservation of these forests and the ecosystem services they provide the decision also identifies that the gcf will engage with the private sector through its private sector facility through this facility the gcf considers that it may provide support by providing funding and instruments to generate credit lines with improved loan conditions for sustainable agricultural practices conditional to maintaining natural forests andor increasing forest areas financing technical assistance to small‐scale farmers to improve capacities and generate opportunities to engage in deforestation‐free supply chains and providing guarantees to reduce market risks and other risks inherent to the forestry and land use sectors including climate variability at this point in time the gcf’s approach to engagement with the private sector is still in its infancy work will commence in the coming months to further develop a policy on the way in which the fund interacts with the private sector likely including the topic of trading in forest carbon tosi mpanu mpanu of the democratic republic of the congo drc a leading board member working on this issue underscored the intention of the gcf to become a global leader on this topic it was emphasized by mpanu mpanu and other board members that funding should not be limited to just a few countries but to all the countries that require support to achieve emissions reductions from forests germany’s board member karsten sachs emphasized the need to ensure clarity on the comparative advantage of the gcf over other funds proving finance on the same subject he elaborated that further work needs to be done on the cohesion and complementarity with initiatives such as the fcpf and unredd sachs also emphasized the importance of support for work by germany and the importance of strengthening the role of the private sector including through supply chain management the decision was welcomed by representatives of indigenous peoples who reinforced that land rights are the basis of success for interventions of this type they emphasized the need to ensure prevention of risks arising from implementation and their desire to see support from the gcf in strengthening land rights payments for forest emissions reductions the second decision was on the topic related to payment for results – meaning verified emissions reductions achieved by following the processes set out by the unfccc framework related to redd the decision was entitled “pilot program for redd results based payments” paris agreement getting down to business in bonn this was a more technical decision than the previous one and one in which the gcf board members ensured their unfccc expert negotiators were present to provide consul on including the us norway malaysia and brazil the resultsbased payments decision contained the following aspects as the “key procedural and technical elements” a access modality requests would be channeled through accredited entities of the gcf albeit acting in a more limited role b financial valuation of results proposed a uniform and fixed price of usd  per ton co eq for the pilot program c size of the request for payments rfp proposed allocating between usd  million and usd  million for the pilot program it was noted that as of june   countries have completed their reference levels and the technical analysis by the unfccc and four countries have submitted redd results to the unfccc secretariat with a potential volume of emissions reductions from countries ranging between  and  million tonnes of co eq over the last two to four years d double payment and double financing considered by the gcf secretariat to be where a country receives both support for activities pertaining to phases  and  of redd and payments for the results achieved during the same periods in phase  proposing that this can be managed through appropriate control policies ie registry systems e use of proceeds proposed that countries receiving redd resultsbased payments rbps should reinvest the proceeds in activities in line with countries’ nationally determined contributions ndcs f ownership legal title and implications on ndcs the emissions reductions paid for by the gcf under the pilot program are proposed not to be transferred to the gcf and should be retired in other words it’s a ‘non market’ approach g eligibility date for results and length of the rfp concerns the eligibility date of results past or future for payments the secretariat suggested the pilot only consider recent expost results the length of the entire process could take up to two years from the launch of the request for payments to the distribution of payments h scale of implementation proposals should be designed to achieve tons of emissions reductions or enhanced removals at national or in the interim subnational level i forest reference emission levels  forest reference levels frelfrl and results the gcf proposes to employ a scorecard to create a bridge from unfccc technical analysis processes to gcf rbp payments j operationalization of the cancun safeguards noting differences between the cancun safeguards and the gcf environmental and social standards countries applying for resultsbased payments will have the primary responsibility of demonstrating how the cancun safeguards have been addressed and respected in the implementation of the redd activities through their summary of information the aes working with the countries will prepare and document an assessment describing how the gcf interim standards have been met and applied in the redd activities again a scorecard will play an important role the secretariat identified the need to better understand the size of the pilot the eligibility date the distribution of payments and the application of the scorecard the board members approached the issue with caution recognizing the complexities sensitivities and history of international negotiations on the topic caroline leclerc of canada one of the champions leading the process mentioned the complexities and the interlinkages of topics as well as the fact that the board is not in a place to fully agree on all the parts of the proposed decision mpanu mpanu mentioned that the price may be a complicated issue as it costs many countries more per ton than usd  to reduce emissions through the forest and land use sector the board members commenced putting forward different positions making it clear that there was not going to be agreement on many issues diverse positions and concerns arose on various topics including eligibility dates transfer the size of the gcf envelope price double financing assessment and the content of the scorecard next steps following a full day of consultations and closed room negotiations the board finally took note of the progress made it asked the secretariat to undertake further analysis to finalize the draft request for further consideration on proposals at the th meeting of the board which will be held in cairo egypt this september pmrv participatory monitoring for redd put to the test the gcf approach to forests on paper at least seems encouraging in many ways this major global fund is seeking at this point in time to look beyond merely economic incentives such as markets and carbon trading to holistic landscape and crosssectoral approaches with broad stakeholder engagement the fund seems to embrace both market and nonmarket approaches although these decisions are about redd specifically the gcf is making efforts to look beyond the limitations associated with the current redd framework concerning matters such as addressing drivers of deforestation it is also seeking to enhance respect for rights in recent years there has been a significant improvement of the fund’s approach to indigenous peoples’ rights this is reflected in the recent decisions taken and the ongoing work related to a standalone indigenous peoples policy expected to be put forth at the next board meeting it is also noteworthy that the gcf is progressively laying the groundwork to engage in more depth on carbon tradingrelated interventions which will no doubt in due course give rise to increasing controversy and potential for reputational risk to the fund the proof however will be in the project approval implementation monitoring and evaluation the gcf is still on a learning curve when it comes to project implementation with  projects now approved and valued at around usd  billion very little funding has started to flow and getting money out the door has been challenging projects approved by the gcf have come under some criticism for lacking consultations with stakeholders and the fund will need to ensure that these issues do not reoccur as it moves further into the realm of forests and
