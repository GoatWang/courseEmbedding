truck which i am restoring who would have thought that one could purchase a brand new engine for less money than overhauling an old one jegs price was the best that i found it was delivered in about three days in perfect condition the small pallet and crate was strapped to an industry standard size pallet and floor loaded in the truck the driver was pleasant and professional the engine is perfect all of the accessories bolted right up to it i havent run the engine yet but the quality appears to be excellent in fact i suspect that it will be better than the original overall im very pleased
