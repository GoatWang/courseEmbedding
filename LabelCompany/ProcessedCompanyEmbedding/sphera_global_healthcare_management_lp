pharmaceutical industries ltd nyse teva tase teva is not good and the share price does not lie sphera global healthcare management lp managing partner ori hershkowitz told globes the day after erez vigodman took up his post as president and ceo of the company teva has a product that accounts for more than half of its profit copaxone which is about to lose its patent and other products that account for a large percentage of its profit and which will face generic competition by the end of the decade hershkowitz adds tevas working assumption is that  will be a low year in profits and that they will grow afterwards the assumption relies on switching  of patients to threetimesaweek copaxone i agree with momenta pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq mnta which is developing a generic version of copaxone that tevas forecast for switching patients is too aggressive and overoptimistic the more patients that teva is able to switch to threetimesaweek copaxone the milder will be the reaction of tevas share price to the launch of generic copaxone says hershkowitz if they succeed in switching  of patients the approval of generic copaxone will send the share price down by over  he estimates related articles copaxone provided  of tevas operating profit copaxone sales fall in us in q but rise worldwide teva cant fall much further vigodman is right medicine for teva hershkowitz is not enthusiastic about tevas new therapeutic entities nte plan either i do not think that they will generate enough growth he says i estimate that more than half of the ntes will never reach market and of those that do make only  will have more than  million in sales the ntes are part of the strategy introduced by former teva ceo jeremy levin levin is one of the smartest men in the pharmaceuticals industry i was optimistic when he was appointed and i was very wrong says hershkowitz levin brought in a clique of middle managers who joined the existing middle managers and introduced a strategy that is divorced from reality and does not meet the logic of the pharmaceutical industry did the board of directors force this strategy on him or did levin choose it himself i think that the former possibility is more likely globes what can vigodman do hershkowitz what levin should have done is no longer possible for vigodman the biotech index which tracks the companies that teva could acquire is up  since the start of the levin era and the acquisitions options are very limited vigodman can finally implement the promised streamlining plan but streamlining wont boost the share price growth engines are needed for that he can sell nonstrategic assets such as the growing otc venture for which he can get a good price and use the proceeds to acquire strategic assets that will contribute to profits nevertheless tevas share is cheap given its riskreward profile isnt it worth buying its very cheap assuming that profits are maintained but if the company does not carry out some kind of initiative to bring in profitgenerating growth engines and the ones it has lose their patents there will be no profits and the share price will no longer be cheap there is uncertainty now and things will be very bad if 7 of the profits disappear and there is great uncertainty about what is going to replace them published by globes online israel business news  wwwglobesonlinecom  on february
