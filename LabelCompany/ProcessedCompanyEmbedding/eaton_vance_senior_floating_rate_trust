while the default rate is a lagging indicator the distress ratio – defined as the percentage of performing loans trading below  – can often paint a clearer pict ure about the path of forward default

t remain low and below average in an historical context this view aligns with the latest splcd quarterly survey of loan managers with the latest poll showing that participants have cut forecasts of nearterm loan defaults though the current credit c ycle may indeed be in its later innings decent economic data now and the potential for supportive trumpera policies ahead should shift default risk from the nearer term to something further out market pricing indicates positivebutnonetheless very limited price appreciation potential from here the average price of the index ended march at  with

component of returns – as the fed projects three quarterpoint rate hikes with month libor at the average floor in the loan market and month libor at  the higher income potential that may follow the next fed rate hike will likely continue to draw investor attention looking ahead we believe the markets technical ba lance remains tipped toward one of strength and we think its likely that asset
