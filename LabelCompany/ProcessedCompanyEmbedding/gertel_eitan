results conference call just a quick reminder todays call is being recorded and now at this time i will turn things over to jerry rawls executive chairman jerry s rawls  executive chairman thank you matt and good afternoon everyone we appreciate youre taking the time to listen to our conference call today a replay of this call should appear on our website within eight hours an audio replay will be available for two weeks by calling area code  for domestic or area code  for international and then enter the id number  i need to remind all of you that any forwardlooking statements in todays discussion are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our annual and quarterly sec filings actual events and results can differ materially from any forwardlooking statements in addition the company undertakes no obligations to update any forwardlooking information presented in addition unless otherwise indicated all results discussed are on a nongaap basis a complete reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap results may be found in our earnings press release and in the investor relations section of our website we have prepared some slides for todays earnings call you can view them by connecting to the investor relations page of our website at finisarcom click on investors then scroll down and click on webcast archives youll see a listing for todays third quarter  earnings call revenues for our just completed third fiscal quarter were  million an increase of  million over the prior quarter revenue growth was primarily driven by the demand for  gigabit and  gigabit transceivers for datacom applications as well as transceivers for fourth generation wireless base station installations and now with that ill let kurt review the rest of the numbers kurt kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jerry datacom revenue increased by  million or  compared to the preceding quarter telecom revenue decreased by  million or  compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to the impact of one month of the annual telecom price reduction that typically takes effect on january  and a decrease in demand for transceivers for telecom applications driven by sluggish carrier capex levels in the third quarter we had one  or greater customer our top  customers represented  of total revenues compared to  in the preceding quarter nongaap gross margins decreased to  from  in the preceding quarter primarily driven by the impact of one month of the telecom price reduction and the impact of substantial yield loss for a new optical engine product for supercomputing applications that we started to ramp into production during the quarter nongaap operating expenses decreased  million to  million from  million in the preceding quarter nongaap operating income increased  million to  million or  of revenues compared to  million or  in the preceding quarter primarily as the result of higher revenue and lower operating expenses nongaap income was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  in the preceding quarter average diluted shares for nongaap purposes totaled  million for nongaap purposes the interest expense for our  million of  convertible notes was approximately  in the third quarter this interest expense is the only impact of these converts in our nongaap diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count third quarter capital expenditures totaled  million this was less than our prior forecast of approximately  million capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  million in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the continued construction of the second building on our new wuxi china factory we expect the second building to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter and we expect to have all remaining volume manufacturing move from shanghai to wuxi and requalified with the customers by the end of our second quarter of fiscal  we will continue to perform rd and npi manufacturing work in shanghai as well as some corporate functions cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased  million to  million at the end of the third quarter nongaap taxes are estimated at  for the fourth quarter and  to  for fiscal  weighted average fully diluted shares for the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to be approximately  million for nongaap purposes there are a number of noncash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits which we exclude from nongaap results these totaled  million last quarter to include all these items as required under gaap we generated net income of  million or  per diluted share compared to a net loss of  million or  per diluted share in the preceding quarter that concludes my comments and ill turn it over to eitan eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director thanks kurt we expect revenues for our fourth quarter will be in the range of  million to  million please note that the fourth quarter of fiscal  will have  weeks compared to  weeks in prior quarter however the positive benefit of revenues for extra week in the quarter will be partially offset by the impact of the chinese new year which occurred in february we expect nongaap gross margins to be approximately  primarily due to the impact of full three months of the annual telecom price reductions nongaap operating expenses are expected to increase primarily due to the extra week relative to the prior quarter nongaap operating margins are expected to be approximately  to  nongaap earning per diluted share are expected to be in the range of  per share to  per share as a reminder our first quarter of fiscal  will once again have  weeks relative to  weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we continue to believe in the longterm growth prospects of the company finisar revenue is driven primarily by growth in the worldwide demand for bandwidth with ever increasing distribution and use of video images and digital information in addition finisar continues to benefit from growth in cloud services which drive networking hardware upgrades of existing data centers and build outs of new hyperscale data centers and now with that i am going to turn back over the call to matt to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and at this time we will take a question from joseph wolf with barclays please go ahead joseph wolf  barclays capital inc thanks guys question about the guidance the range implies a broad range of revenues very little on the margin side is there a large order in there that you are factoring into that guidance or is there some sort of mix that i am not seeing on the margin side of the guidance kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well again the guidance is reflective of the fact that – the revenue guidance is reflective of the fact that well have the one extra week offset by the impact of chinese new year the gross margin guidance was reflective of the fact that we will have  weeks of expenses as well as well have the full three months of the telecom price reduction joseph wolf  barclays capital inc so there could be some variability in the mix thats the kind of impact is kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well there is always variability of mix joseph wolf  barclays capital inc but its not one big contract out there thats providing us with that big range kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer no we typically provide a range about that wide weve widened it up a little bit this quarter just to reflect the fact that weve got  weeks instead of  weeks joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay understood i wanted to go in a little bit more detail into the  gig side it sounds like the hyperscale data centers are still doing well and i was hoping if you could talk to us a little bit about the pricing dynamic and the competitive forces going on in that market in terms of other players given the growth prospects there jerry s rawls  executive chairman well as you point out that market is still going strong there are an awful lot of  gig transceivers in the qsfp form factor that are being consumed by a number of the big cloud services operators and its competitive market its like all the markets that we participate in it has a number of competitors and its all about performance its all about economics so i dont know how to describe it much differently than that joseph wolf  barclays capital inc is there similar pricing pressure to the telecom side of the business right now jerry s rawls  executive chairman well the telecom pricing pressure comes mostly at the end of a calendar year where we have negotiations with the big equipment companies for prices that go for a yearly – for  months there are a few exceptions to that but for the most part we negotiate sort of month agreements in the telecom business so thats behind us now joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay thank you operator at this time well take a question from james kisner with jefferies llc james m kisner  jefferies llc hi guys thanks for taking my question so just wanted to start with the gross margin impact from the yield loss would you mind – could you quantify that a little bit for us and does your guidance for the coming quarter assume that yield loss and i guess relatedly like maybe you could talk about the revenues associated with this opportunity if theyre coming in next quarter or did you see any this quarter how big is it et cetera kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well id say the impact this quarter of that yield loss was probably about  basis points in terms of the – and certainly were working on improving that yield but as of today we havent made as much progress as wed like so i think we will continue to be challenged this quarter but hopefully by the time we get into q well start to see some of the benefits in terms of the revenue opportunity i think the revenue opportunity right now is still relatively small versus our overall business but certainly its a business that we hope once we improve the yield that well be able to ramp and sell a lot more but its still a pretty small part of our business even though its having a big impact on our gross margins james m kisner  jefferies llc great okay id love to hear a little bit – we just heard about  gig  gig strength in datacom is it fair to say that it is driven by the ramp of cfp is that becoming a more substantial revenue contributor i guess im assuming its a lot bigger than the vcselbased gig could you give us any kind of texture on whether or not cfp is contributing perhaps you can tell us kind of the rough proportion of  gig revenues coming from cfp jerry s rawls  executive chairman lets see our crossover for cfp to cfp is – were not quite there but were almost there and we had substantial growth in cfp but we also had – we had a very good quarter for the cfps james m kisner  jefferies llc thats interesting are you seeing any – and i assume the cfps are going to systems that are not with your largest datacom customer are you seeing the cpec  module out there any kind of competition from that jerry s rawls  executive chairman i dont really have a lot of good data on that one just – we dont see much of it but i know that they are being sold and i couldnt comment on the volumes i couldnt comment on the impact if there is an impact on our business i just dont know james m kisner  jefferies llc okay last question just telecom obviously its a very challenging environment for everybody here so you are not alone but any thoughts on the outlook for the year  yearoveryear decline i mean is that how we should think about telecom sort of through this year or is there a reason to think that telecom could get significantly better thanks eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i mean the way were guiding telecom for next quarter we say it is pretty much flat with this quarter and maybe with the  weeks its slightly up but no significant change quarteroverquarter there are some new products that have come into the market right now from us and as they ramp through the year we should see an improvement but most improvement like we were talking before what will be the driver for telecom will be the metro but it still has few quarters to go before it becomes meaningful for the revenue in that segment james m kisner  jefferies llc all right thanks guys ill pass it i appreciate it operator at this time we will take a question from mark sue with rbc capital markets mark sue  rbc capital markets llc thank you gentlemen you made some really strong improvement in operating expenses reductions during the quarter and then i am trying to get a sense of what part of that is actual changes that youve taken out in opex or is it really rather expenses moving from quartertoquarter kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think there are several factors certainly we are focused on trying to keep opex relatively flat given the kind of gross margins so that we can improve our operating margins so there is certainly a lot of focus on that we did benefit some this quarter based on the continuing strengthening of the dollar so i think thats part of it and we did have some expenses that we thought wed spend this quarter on rd project materials that got pushed into next quarter so id say its a combination of all three of those things mark sue  rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and gentlemen on the gross margin recognizing the telecom price reductions the mix in the volume are you also starting to see intensifying competition on  gig and potentially  gig and so there is some preemptive not – thought to kind of maintain your market share in these two transport speed implied in the gross margin kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think as jerry mentioned  gig and i assume youre talking ethernet side datacom side so  gig and  gig continues to be a very competitive space and obviously were working hard to maintain our margins despite any pricing pressure that we see mark sue  rbc capital markets llc okay lastly as it relates to competition and industry structure jerry now that youve had a chance to look at the  on jdsu what are your thoughts in terms of consolidation and youre more interested less interested as to say your thoughts on just going at it alone or offsetting some price competition with greater scale jerry s rawls  executive chairman well we continue to believe that consolidation is important in our industry and it would be attractive to achieve consolidation but with respect to jdsu or any other company i dont think we have any particular comments to make operator mr sue did you have anything further mark sue  rbc capital markets llc thank you operator at this time we will take a question from kent schofield with goldman sachs kent s schofield  goldman sachs  co great thank you just one from me around the web scale guys and i guess in particular kind of the web  guys can you just talk a little bit structurally about your visibility there and then just kind of the activity that you are seeing on the go forward as we look at some of the capex estimates going forward they are slowing some but just want to get a sense for how you are thinking about that and how your visibility has evolved over time jerry s rawls  executive chairman well one of the frustrations of that web  sector is that all of the revenue that goes into it at least from our end is sort of dependent upon construction projects and the construction projects have many facets there is physical structure there is electrical distribution there is air conditioning there is the wiring there is all of the hardware that goes in and if any one of those runs late then the whole project runs late and you get – and our optics after you got all the stuff in place get plugged in and now you connect everything so forecasting has been a challenge because our customers in these construction projects have been challenged with having predictable schedules and so i – the business is strong the market has still a lot of demand percentage growth may be slower in the future than it has been in the past ive read predictions like that but the absolute magnitude of the growth is greater than it has been in the past and or we expect it to be so its a big market becoming a much bigger market so we are still paying a lot of attention there and we just wish that there was a little less volatility if thats the right word in the shipment patterns that we have with the big web  operators kent s schofield  goldman sachs  co thank you jerry for the color operator and at this time we will take a question from subu subrahmanyan with juda group subu subrahmanyan  the juda group thank you i have two questions first on the  weeks versus  weeks i know you had mentioned that there is some benefit in the  weeks partially offset by chinese new year if we look out to july and if you just look historically if you return back to a week quarter has that traditionally meant kind of a revenue decline or less of an increase how has that worked out historically and how do you expect it to play out this year kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well subu we changed our fiscal year two years ago in fiscal  and so for most fiscal years we have  weeks in every quarter and its only once every four years to five years that the fourth quarter will have  weeks so weve never had this experience before but as you think about q given the fact that q will have  weeks and q will have  weeks then i would expect revenues would decline just based on the pure number of weeks in the quarter subu subrahmanyan  the juda group and is it linear kurt i mean  weeks and  weeks this is  difference should we think about that or is it not that linear kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well again i think in this quarter youve got the benefit of  weeks and some partial offset as the result of chinese new year so you have to take that delta and then apply it and then if there was a weektoweek basis certainly we would expect some level of growth going from q to q so once youve adjusted for  weeks versus  weeks you should layer in a little bit of growth subu subrahmanyan  the juda group understood and then gross margin i think you mentioned that the impact of the low yield was about  basis points you have some ongoing impacts so if i look past april you dont have the telco price reductions going into july the capex starts to level off hopefully the yield issues which still continue to impact this quarter start to lighten how should we think about gross margin trend line past the april quarter kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say we obviously dont provide guidance but typically first quarter gross margin is higher than fourth quarter gross margin so hopefully that pattern continues subu subrahmanyan  the juda group and then how should we think about the impact of if the yield issues are fixed and the capex declines just those two factors what kind of a swing factor do those create on gross margin kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer its hard to break that down because obviously if the yield improves then were also shipping more units and so some of that offsets each other but certainly weve seen in the past again we can look at this historically meaningful improvement in the first quarter gross margin over the fourth quarter subu subrahmanyan  the juda group understood and final question on telco jerry eitan this quarter the level of telco revenues is the lowest revenue in five years since you started breaking it out and i know i understand the carrier capex challenges and still waiting for metro but how do you think about this business in terms of investing in telco given it continues to decline as a percentage of revenue and hitting kind of multiyear lows at a time where the market is not healthy but for your competitors its not as challenging as it seems for you as well eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i think currently subu were investing in the more strategic products that we think is going to have the growth and obviously in the product thats not going to give us the return on investment were reducing the level of rd so obviously we have big investments going in coherent and some level of roadms and other things and sfp so we choose our products and we try to match what we expect from the growth and what we expect the best return to be subu subrahmanyan  the juda group i understand just weve been in that  million to  million for a long time now were closing probably closer to  million im just wondering from a run rate perspective as things get better should this be  of revenues or i mean  is it a  million run rate just trying to understand given the steep declines weve seen in telecom what the real run rate of this business is as you start getting back to some growth areas eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director well i think if you look at the longterm im still hoping that this thing will be coming back to the  million level i cant tell you exactly when that will happen its actually its all the rampup of new product its the impact of all the upgrades in the metro and actually some of the telecom products spreading and going into nontelecom application with telecom type product so all those combined together should help grow the revenue but on the longterm i expect that to be in the  million level subu subrahmanyan  the juda group okay go ahead thank you operator and at this time we will hear from simon leopold with raymond james simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc thank you very much i wanted to just check on this just keep our lives simple in terms of the opex trend with the extra week youre suggesting april would be around  millionish  million  million and then july operating expenses should be similar to the january level is that the way we should think about it kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say operating expenses most of it is variable so as you looked at that i would say youre probably going to increase about  million or so this quarter and then that  million would go back down the following quarter but then there is obviously kind of a normal growth rate of operating expenses and the third quarter we just finished we were at a pretty historically low level given some of the push out in the project material on the rd side so id say there will be some growth in fiscal q versus fiscal q simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc okay thank you and then you talked about the web scale guys i havent heard much mention of submarine exposure and i know a number of the oems your customers on the systems side have been taking about submarine opportunities both literally under ocean or opportunities at landing sites i am wondering if you could give us some sense of how big an opportunity that is for your business and what the growth trends are eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i think simon the answer to that is i dont know because a lot of the equipment that goes in the edge of the submarine line is the regular equipment we sell to other telco applications so we know there are some submarine lines looking at equipment from us but we dont know how much of it is going to either one of the applications some of them are starting to look at the high data rate coherence and things like that but there is still time to go for that to be meaningful but the rest of it i wouldnt know how to break it down simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc and does that fall in your telco or your datacom segment eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director well i think majority of it is in the telco side but again i dont have the visibility to that simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc okay and then several quarters back the increased exposure to china and china backhaul affected your gross margin i am just wondering where those projects are in light of what looks like flattening capex in calendar  in china as china mobile slows and maybe telecom and unicom ramp can you talk a little bit about the dynamic of china and how that affects your business eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director well the backhaul equipment which we talked at wireless we talked about china was slightly up this quarter not much and we predict it to be slightly up again but not in any significance so the level is flat to slightly up over the prior quarter and the quarter looking forward and the margin impact of those is the same as it was before its below our corporate average simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc okay and then youve talked about longterm targets particularly the gross margin trending towards the mid range i just want to do a check on how you feel about those targets and whether we should think about trending towards the mids over a period of a couple years or whether you feel like you can exit fiscal  significantly higher just want to get an idea what kind of slope we should think about towards the longerterm targets kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well certainly weve got a ways to go given our guidance in q of approximately  but were certainly aiming to get back to the mids but i think weve got a couple of years to get there so we should see some improvement from the  range in fy  we hope obviously it depends on revenue growth and mix but weve got a couple of years where we need to continue to prove it to get to where we really want it to be simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc great thank you for taking my questions operator and at this time well take a question from patrick newton with stifel patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes thank you for taking my questions i wanted to dive a little bit into the opex side in your prepared remarks you talk about significantly decreasing operating expenses but then during this kind of qa you talked about that january is at historically low levels given some pushouts of rd projects so should we think about finisar as being in a period or perhaps exiting a period where theyve invested aggressively in rd and we should start to see that line item growth be below the revenue growth rate that youre in somewhat of a harvest mode or conversely should we tend to think that opex should relatively pace the revenue growth rate over an intermediate term period kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer were hoping to keep operating expenses relatively flat so that we get some leverage to that extent and our goal is to ultimately drive that close to  of revenue over time that will obviously depend on – when we get there will obviously depend on the pace on revenue growth but certainly were looking to get some level of leverage on the operating expense line realizing that some quarters are going to lumpy and some are going to be up and some are going to be down so its not going to necessarily be a straightline but we certainly are driving towards getting some operating leverage at the operating expense line patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thats helpful and then i guess jerry i wanted to dig into datacom mix in the quarter and how we should think about it on a goforward basis you did talk about hyperscale being up a little bit i think wireless you did talk about some sequential growth can you give us a little bit on your thoughts on enterprise business on the fiber channel storage side of the business and then also any thoughts that you have on the transaction between avago and emulex and does that change the competitive landscape or impact your customer base at all jerry s rawls  executive chairman lets see datacom in general i would say the enterprise part of the business is mostly gigabit ethernet and gigabit ethernet continues to be a good product and revenues we expect for the quarter will be up a bit in that sector its not – the gig and gig have pretty specific targets but theyre not really enterprise they tend to be hyperscale or the client sides of routers but overall enterprise seems to be doing well with moderate growth rates the fiber channel sector i mean its again not a rapidly growing sector overall but one of the things that were seeing now is much more rapid take of gig fiber channel most of our shipments for several years now have been gigabit fiber channel and the gig was sort of limited to the switch makers but were not starting to ship gigabit fiber channel to a number of the equipment suppliers of the storage arrays and host bus adapters et cetera so we expect that gig will be greater than gig shipments here probably within the next year patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc any comments on of avago emulex jerry s rawls  executive chairman oh avago emulex i dont have – i dont really have a view of that one emulex has been a good customer of ours for a long time on the other hand now we – avago is a competitor in that datacom space and so my guess is that is there is going to be some decisions that have to be made there but in general any customer any one of the equipment companies wants to have at least two sources of supply even if one is internal so i would expect that we will still have an ongoing relationship with emulex patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay great thank you for taking my questions good luck operator at this time well move to troy jensen with piper troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker hey thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter gentlemen a quick one for jerry one of your competitors in datacom had a problem with the gig components in the quarter so i was wondering if you saw a benefit in either the january quarter revenues or the april quarter guidance due to share gains at this web  company jerry s rawls  executive chairman we think so but nobody told us exactly thats been a – there is an element of security and maybe you can even say secrecy that goes with some of the web  competitors i mean the competitor – guys that are in the web  business building out these data centers and theyre trying to protect information about their business and their activities so its always that we have very specific information about why is our business going up or why was our business going down in this case it was going up so troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker all right thats fair maybe a follow up for eitan all right sorry to interrupt then a follow up for eitan can you just give an update on how the samples of the g coherent cfp modules have been received and just also on the timing when you think that ramps eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i would say were shipping samples to customers customers who have received our sample have very good response they are very happy with our performance in some cases theyre surprised of the performance but its early days its really at alpha stage and as far as the program versus our schedule i would say plusminus couple of weeks were on schedule so we expect to continue with the program and continue with our ramp its a significant product program from us and again were excited about the performance the level we can achieve from this module troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker all right perfect good luck gentlemen operator at this time well move to jorge rivas with craighallum please go ahead jorge e rivas  craighallum capital group llc good afternoon thanks for taking my question so a complicated question but i will ask it anyway because your datacom mix is higher its ever been so if we were to exclude the impact from the yield loss from the optical engine and it sounds like the impact on the mix from the wireless transceivers its been the same the past couple of quarters this would suggest that your rest of the business gross margins are not even close to what you did about a year ago which was about  so i wonder if you can walk me through whats going on in the rest of the business are you seeing more pricing pressure in datacom or is it just that telecom given the lower base of revenues youre experiencing probably onetime pretty low gross margins for this quarter and we would eventually expect that to go back where it was once telecom picked up if you can just walk through whats going on with the gross margin it would be great jerry s rawls  executive chairman well the biggest change over that period when our gross margins have gone from  to  has been in the gig ethernet if you recall if we go back year and a half ago we had virtually – i dont know if we didnt have  of the market we had  or  of the market we were an early entry we had a cfp gig lr device that that was fully functional it contained an ic set that we designed here at finisar and there was no other functional ics in the industry and so our sales were growing very rapidly our margins were exceptionally high we were on allocation for several quarters and – but all that came to an end as merchant semiconductor companies were able to correct the errors in their chips and produce functional chips and so then a number of competitors were empowered they entered the market at substantially lower prices and so we had – our prices had to come down to be competitive so that has been the largest impact on our margins over the last year year and a half jorge e rivas  craighallum capital group llc thank you jerry really appreciate it and then just going on the business if we split it out by speeds  has it changed from last quarter meaning that gig is the fastest growing part of the business and gig remains the largest portion of revenues jerry s rawls  executive chairman yes jorge e rivas  craighallum capital group llc its still the same jerry s rawls  executive chairman its still the same jorge e rivas  craighallum capital group llc okay all right thats all for me thanks guys jerry s rawls  executive chairman thanks operator at this time well go to ted moreau with barrington research ted j moreau  barrington research hi great thank you guys just want to follow up on this gig cfp comment that you just had jerry given some of your competitors or many of your competitors are may be a little bit earlier competing in the cfp versus what they were on the cfp and the original cfp can you just talk about what are going to be the dynamics of winning opportunities is it going to be time to market performance price and then how do you see a more competitive cfp business impacting your overall business jerry s rawls  executive chairman lets see cfp is going to be an exciting product area it is exciting for us right now in that we are shipping everything we can build if we could double our output we could sell double our output but we are increasing our capacity demand is strong equipment companies are designing blades that have cfp ports because they can double the density on their blades and i think its an exciting market now the margins there will never be as high as they were with our original cfp because we have competitors and in cfp we were the only game in town so – but the margins are quite good i mean its not like its a bad product its a good product and we think the demand is going to be strong as equipment companies convert their boxes to having these high density blades i mean theres still a lot of ports for cfp there is a lot of ports even that are being shipped from the oems but theres a lot of ports in the field that were shipped where blades were not fully populated and for the expansion of networks in central offices they continue to buy cfps and plug them in the cfp slots so were going to see cfp revenue for quite some time but cfp is clearly growing faster ted j moreau  barrington research okay and how does cfp margins compare to corporate average jerry s rawls  executive chairman higher ted j moreau  barrington research okay jerry s rawls  executive chairman cfp is higher than the corporate average ted j moreau  barrington research okay great and then one other question you were talking about – there was a question about consolidation in the industry and if you were to play a role in consolidation what would you be looking for i mean would you look to just simple gain scale would it be to eliminate a competitor to make it a less challenging competitive environment would it be to pickup a technology what are your thought process there and jerry s rawls  executive chairman all of the above i mean any consolidation move could accomplish any one of those things or multiple of them and the more of the factors that you could make a positive contribution through some acquisition i mean that makes it more attractive that means there is more value there so ted j moreau  barrington research okay thank you very much operator moving forward well hear from michael genovese with mkm partners michael e genovese  mkm partners llc great thanks i just have one question youve already indicated somewhat how we should think about q revenues so if we look beyond the current quarter two quarters out – on the gross margins two quarters out are you willing to say that the q should mark the bottom and then we should be up in q sequentially a bit kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well again were not providing guidance for that but historically q has had better gross margins than q michael e genovese  mkm partners llc okay thats all i have thanks operator dmitry netis with william blair has the next question dmitry g netis  william blair  co llc thank you for squeezing me in a couple of quick ones from me i was just wondering the depreciation expense that was going through the gross margin due to construction of the facility in china when does that kurt begins to alleviate and is that a multiyear effect is that a couple of quarter effect kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well ill answer it in two ways i think capital expenditures after this quarter should start to decline as i mentioned the building – the second building should be done this quarter and so i would expect capital expenditures to start to decline as a result of that in terms of depreciation i expect depreciation to continue to increase because again comparing current capex levels with whats rolling off five years – that you spent five years ago so depreciation will continue to increase but capex should come down and the rate of change of the depreciation should start to be less dmitry g netis  william blair  co llc and how much basis points did that contribute in the quarter that effect of depreciation expense in the gross margin kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well again in this quarter depreciation went up i think about  so dmitry g netis  william blair  co llc okay all right excellent thank you and then again a quick one on telecom side i know a lot of questions have been asked on that front but im just curious like the competitors – one of the major competitors there had seen their roadm business actually snap back sequentially – i dont know if you could – were willing to talk about your roadm business but it sounds from the numbers that that business had declined so i dont know why youre not seeing exactly the positive impact of perhaps even the g metro deployment with att ciena reported this morning and talked about some metro projects already in effect i know there is verizon metro and thats potentially where you will be playing with the flexgrid roadms what im trying to sort of get to is is it different architecture on the roadm side that will begin to give you growth in that business and you just sort of excluded at the moment from the current metro projects that are going on if you could comment on those two major carriers deployments that would be helpful eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i dont think we are excluded from any deployment our roadm business we dont break it down but its doing fine its not growing tremendously but its pretty flat quarteroverquarter and we have a significant share in the market i dont think our share has changed in the market in any meaningful way and we actually have high expectation for the market going forward for more roadm playing actually in the metro project that youre talking about so i dont think at all we lost any step in this markets and i think our new products are playing very well but we havent seen growth yet and thats what were looking for but the product line itself is working fine dmitry g netis  william blair  co llc okay thank you and if i may and i apologize for being that specific i recall again going back a few years top three customers of yours were cisco alcatellucent and huawei and cisco is sort of hanging in there and certainly had a nice quarter and perhaps you were seeing the wind of that this quarter as well and then going into the next quarter but what about the alcatellucents and huaweis i mean are you seeing other customers replacing them are you seeing them snapping back how are these major customers of yours are performing at the moment are you happy with that performance eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director look i mean the only thing i can say we cant talk about specific customers we cant comment on what customer does versus others all i can say we have share in all of them and when everybody wins – when everybody – when each one of them wins i mean we benefit from one versus the other and maybe in some different weights or ratios but we do but i cant comment on a specific customer versus others operator we have time for one more question in the queue we will go to dave kang with b riley david kang  b riley  co llc thank you good afternoon first of all regarding your datacom sales increasing  i was wondering if you can go over the mix between g g and wireless kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer so g grew the most followed by wireless and then g david kang  b riley  co llc okay ill say wireless was number two and what about – for your – the outlook should we expect similar dynamics for g and g to be growing faster than wireless in the first quarter kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer its always hard to tell quartertoquarter but i think we think that g and g are going to be growth drivers next quarter id say we expect wireless to be slightly up but our clarity into that business is not perfect david kang  b riley  co llc got it and then moving to telecom i was wondering – eitan already talked about wss but what about tunable xfp and if you can just – if youre not going to break it out specifically can you just tell us what the rough mix is between wss plus tunable xfp in terms of overall telecom sales kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer again were not going to break it out productbyproduct i would say tunable xfp was slightly down in the quarter david kang  b riley  co llc and how much is the g telecom or g and below telecom kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer again were not going to break out the details of that we break out telecom we break datacom and well talk directionally about every product line but were not going to break it out eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director we dont have any meaningful telecom below g anyway david kang  b riley  co llc okay all right and then did you talk about price decline what the actual price decline was kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer well we said last december nothing has changed since then it was at the higher end of the  to  range david kang  b riley  co llc got it got it and i was wondering if you can tell us emulex what their percentage of revenue kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer no we cant tell david kang  b riley  co llc you cant okay got it thank you operator that does conclude the questionandanswer session at this time ill turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks jerry s rawls  executive chairman

statements in addition the company undertakes no obligations to update any forwardlooking information presented today in addition unless otherwise indicated all results discussed are on a nongaap basis a complete reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap results may be found in our earnings press release and in the investor relations section of our website we have prepared some slides for todays earnings call you can view them by connecting to the investor relations page of our website at finisarcom click on investors under the heading latest financial results you will see a listing for todays fourth quarter and fiscal year  earnings call revenues for our fiscal fourth quarter were  million an increase of  million or  over the prior quarter revenue growth was primarily from the extra or th week in our fourth quarter partially offset by the impact of chinese new year and with that ill let kurt review the rest of the numbers kurt kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jerry datacom revenue increased by  million or  compared to the preceding quarter telecom revenue increased by  million or  compared to the preceding quarter in the fourth quarter we had one  or greater customer our top  customers represented  of total revenue compared to  in the preceding quarter nongaap gross margin increased to  from  in the preceding quarter primarily due to the improvement in yields for a new optical engine product for supercomputing applications as you may recall we started to ramp up this product in the third quarter of fiscal  and it had negatively impacted gross margin during that quarter these improvements are partially offset by the impact of the full three months annual telecom price reduction that typically takes effect on january  nongaap operating expenses increased  million primarily due to the extra week of salaries in q relative to q higher rd project materials associated with the qualification of new products and higher sales and marketing expenses due to the higher revenue levels as you may recall in the third quarter rd expenses were lower than originally forecast due to the pushout of some of these project materials into q and beyond nongaap operating income increased  million to  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the preceding quarter as a result of the higher gross margin nongaap income was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  in the preceding quarter average diluted shares for nongaap purposes totaled  million for nongaap purposes the interest expense for our  million of  convertible notes was approximately  in the fourth quarter this interest expense is the only impact of these converts in our nongaap diluted earnings per share as no shares are added to the fully diluted share count fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled  million this was less than our prior forecast of approximately  million as the timing of some of the expenditures associated with the wuxi building were pushed into the first quarter capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  million in the first quarter construction of the second building of our new wuxi china factory is now complete including the fitout of the two of the four floors however at this time weve decided to fit out the remaining two floors starting in the first quarter this work will be completed by the end of fiscal  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment increased  million to  million at the end of the fourth quarter nongaap taxes are estimated at approximately  in fiscal  weighted average fully diluted shares for the first fiscal quarter are expected to be approximately  million shares for nongaap purposes there are a number of noncash or infrequently occurring charges and benefits which we exclude from our nongaap results these totaled  million last quarter if we included all these items as required under gaap we generated net income of  million or  per diluted share compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share in the preceding quarter that concludes my comments and ill turn it over to eitan eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director thanks kurt we expect revenues from our first quarter to be in the range of  million to  million as a reminder our first quarter of fiscal  will be once again a week quarter relative to a week quarter in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we expect our nongaap gross margins to be approximately  primarily as a result of the benefit of increased weekly volumes partially offsetted by the impact of increased competition nongaap operating expenses are expected to be approximately  million to  million salaries will be lower from only having  weeks in this quarter other expenses will be pushed a bit higher by higher rd project material spending for new product qualification an increase in the employer portion of payroll taxes from the annual vesting of employee rsus which occurs in june every year and the cost associated with our biannual sales conference nongaap operating margins are expected to be approximately  to  and nongaap earning per diluted share are expected to be in the range of  to  per share we continue to believe in the longterm growth prospects of the company finisars revenue is driven primarily by the growth in worldwide demand for bandwidth with the ever increasing distribution and use of video images and digital information in addition finisar continues to benefit from the growth in cloud services which drives networking hardware upgrades of existing data centers and the buildout of new hyperscale data centers and now with that im going to go to turn the call back to shannon to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator yes sir thank you and our first question comes from mr alex henderson with needham  company alex henderson  needham  co llc hey guys can you give us a little bit of more granularity on some of the individual products and what segments are improving what segments are under pressure what youre seeing in terms of scaledout data center builds whats going on with the roadm business those type of metrics there wasnt a whole lot about products in the discussion kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we said both datacom and telecom grew so i think in general we talked about that i think again the strength or the growth in datacom was primarily in gig and gig and we did have some falloff in our wireless business on the telecom side i think we saw a little bit of growth in the wss as well as i think tunable was a little bit of growth alex henderson  needham  co llc within the wireless i assume thats mainly cpri common public radio interface are you expecting that to continue to come off i assume that the ran radio access network builds are moderating a little bit this year from last year is that the right way to think about that kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think right now we think wireless in this coming quarter relative to prior quarter will be flat to slightly down given the  weeks versus the  weeks alex henderson  needham  co llc okay and just one last question on the weeks stuff can you give us your sense is it right to think of that as  over  thats the percentage adjustment or is it right to think of that as some modestly lower adjustment than that when were thinking about the top line kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer again as you think about the fourth quarter we obviously had the benefit of the th week but that was partially offset by the chinese new year and so if you look at the growth that we had q to q that was about  million so when youre thinking about the next quarter its hard to exactly say what the impact of both those things were but i think thats something you can use that metric alex henderson  needham  co llc it sounds like a  to  number is probably the right number to use in the comp kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i dont think theres anything else i can say alex henderson  needham  co llc okay ill cede the floor thank you operator and our next question comes from mark sue with rbc capital markets mark sue  rbc capital markets llc thank you if i look at it year over year a year ago you had  weeks this year youll have  weeks so the comparisons are more reasonable and then the midpoint of that is actually a decline on a yearoveryear basis so are there particular products youre seeing more of a slowdown on a yearoveryear basis kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer if youre comparing the forecast for this q i believe to last years q we did have a big spike in last years q because of wireless and as we noted wireless has been down and we expect it to be probably flat to down a little bit again this quarter based on the week to week basis mark sue  rbc capital markets llc okay and kurt if we look at the wireless weakness last year i think some of that was related to china and their ramp in g and the mix of products there what are we seeing in terms of china this year as they expand their g networks if you could give us some color that would be helpful eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director if youre talking about – mark youre talking about the wireless in china the cpri ware so thats what we said the majority of the wireless for us is going in china we expect that for us to be flat to slightly down and the rest of the year well see how it evolves we dont know exactly mark sue  rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and lastly as we think about just the steady state in the growth in the data centers and your opportunities there any thoughts of recalibrating how we should be thinking about opex on an annual basis of sales and marketing and also rd kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer again we continue to invest heavily in rd i think new products are the lifeblood of the company so well continue to do that as ive said several times i think our ultimate goal is to get opex to approximately  of revenue but weve got a ways to go there and that will be driven mainly by increases in revenue and some leverage on the operating expense line but operating expenses will continue at some pace going forward mark sue  rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful thank you and good luck operator next question comes from patrick newton with stifel please go ahead patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc good afternoon jerry eitan and kurt and thank you for taking my questions jumping right in kurt i guess i was a little bit surprised that youre only guiding for a gross margin increase  basis points sequentially coming off of the full impact of telecom pricing in the april quarter what is driving this are you seeing more aggressive datacom pricing are there any mix assumptions that youve baked in that are impacting the margin guide and can you elaborate a little bit i think it was during eitans prepared remarks where you stated that youre seeing some increased competition can you elaborate on that kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i think again as we said for the guide whats driving the positive increase is the additional weekly volumes that we expect given its overall revenue is relatively flat but wed have  weeks versus  weeks so youve got a higher weekly volume which helps gross margin as eitan alluded to we are seeing increased competition and i think thats the offsetting factor to margins patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc has that increased in telecom versus datacom has that increased in a certain speed g g g is that across the roadms wss anywhere that you can point to where its more exacerbated jerry s rawls  executive chairman no its mostly in the datacom space patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc in singlemode versus multimode jerry s rawls  executive chairman i would say its both singlemode and multimode patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thats helpful and then can you elaborate a little bit on your g business can you help us perhaps understand the relative contribution to datacom versus telecom segments and then could you give us an update on both kind of your product roadmap for the qsfp and also the coherent cfp i believe you were shipping samples last quarter and i would love to get your thoughts on when we could see volume shipments of that product kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer to talk about gig datacom again its an important part of our business it grew last quarter i think weve said its below  of revenue but its still a meaningful part of our revenue and ill let eitan talk a little bit about gig cfp coherent eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director patrick last quarter we started shipping – demonstrating basically alpha products and weve continued ramping our shipment to customers and as we said before we see that being more meaningful to our revenue towards the end of the calendar year so we continue to ship units for gig application and gig application in a cfp format patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then just last one if i may is can you comment on how we should think about datacom versus telecom in the july quarter relative to the flattish sequential overall revenue guide kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think again in q well be losing the benefit of the th week but we do think that most of the growth will come from gig datacom patrick m newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you for taking my questions good luck operator next question comes from james kisner with jefferies llc james martin kisner  jefferies llc hi guys thanks for taking my questions just back to this question of datacom competition obviously inovyte  filed today and theyre obviously growing very fast in the datacom space and im wondering if these are one of the guys that youre seeing from a competition from at a higher level in these large scaledout data centers how are you feeling about your market share do you expect to maintain that or might you back away from some of this business if pricing gets a bit irrational and just could you comment more on sort of the competition and particularly in the hyperscale data centers thanks jerry s rawls  executive chairman the hyperscale data centers are a little bit different than enterprise in that they often will accept products that are good enough and dont necessarily have to meet all of the industry specifications the bell core specs et cetera and so that means that they will accept offerings from less than tier  companies and so there is a bit more competitive pressures that go into that space and so – but nevertheless we expect to maintain our market share were the largest supplier in the world and were the largest supplier into that space and our expectations are that we will be – we will absolutely be competitive and were going to maintain our market share james martin kisner  jefferies llc so just on gig it sounds like that was down sequentially would you attribute that to lumpiness is there any kind of potential thats already happening wait for effect for jerry s rawls  executive chairman its lumpiness we expect that gig is going to be very strong next quarter we had one particular customer who we expected to ship more to and they had predicted but part of the lumpiness of their acceptance pattern shifted out to the next quarter james martin kisner  jefferies llc okay and on gig it sounds like that was up sequentially im wondering is that mostly driven by cfp i think where are we in this cfp versus cfp transition can you give us a little detail on that jerry s rawls  executive chairman its both strength in cfp and cfp we still sell more cfp and therere more cfp slots out there to fill than there are cfp but as you might expect more and more hardware designs are being created with cfp sockets so we think over the next year or two cfp is going to continue to increase and it will eventually overtake cfp but right now theyre both alive well and doing and strong in revenue but still cfp is larger james martin kisner  jefferies llc okay last one and ill pass just wss modules that strength is that potentially the green shoots of the metro deployments of gig or just seasonality or just any kind of say longhaul versus metro just any kind of color on the wss strength and whether or not you expect that to kind of continue through the year would be very helpful thanks kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think – again i think wss did grow in the fourth quarter and i think our expectations are its going to grow again in the first quarter i dont know if eitan wants to add some color or commentary eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i think the growth weve seen todate is from existing product that we were shipping before and we start to seeing ramp from new products from a lot of our dual product lines so we expect that to be favorable for the wss as we move along the year james martin kisner  jefferies llc all right thanks very much operator next question comes from subu subrahmanyan from the juda group subu subrahmanyan  the juda group thank you my first question is just if i try to quantify the impact of the extra week offset by chinese new year i think in the past kurt you had mentioned that that would be approximately a low doubledigit million positive impact is that the right way to think about it and would your  million have been essentially flat quarteroverquarter somewhere in the  million  million number and would this quarters midpoint be up about  is that the right way to think about it kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer its hard to exactly say what the impact of the th week and chinese new year but i would say in general if we had – without the impact of that i think last quarter would have been relatively flat so then you can – we obviously have already given you our forecast for q subu subrahmanyan  the juda group sure and was telco a little bit better and datacom a little bit lower than expected if you look at sort of how april played out kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think jerry mentioned that we had some lumpiness at one gig customer that was a little bit lower than expected so i think thats true and i also think wireless was probably a little bit lower than expected and we saw again a little bit of strength in wss and tunable despite the fact that we had the full three months of the telecom price reduction subu subrahmanyan  the juda group understood and on the higher competition comment i know you mentioned that it was both singlemode and multimode is it at the higher speeds as well as at gig gig is it sort of across the board on speeds is it more gig and wireless can you give us some sense of where that higher competition is jerry s rawls  executive chairman its gig its wireless and its gig as well because remember gig is really four lanes of gig so the basic technology is still gig technology and its not at gig subu subrahmanyan  the juda group okay understood and then final question on web scale can you talk about the webscale players as a percent of revenue sort of where theyre trending to and with the talk about gig servers gig in the data center when do you think that starts to become sort of a demand driver it seems like aggregation speeds in the data center today are still mostly at gig im wondering gig in the data center when do you start to think of that as a real revenue driver jerry s rawls  executive chairman it will happen in the second half of this year as well start seeing much more gig xgig in data centers and i think it will be really exciting into calendar year  overall that data center market is still the fastest growing segment in all of optics so it is quite an opportunity subu subrahmanyan  the juda group and so if i look at this quarter up kind of low singledigit percent quarter over quarter if you ex out the timing issues do you expect that trend line to continue jerry given gig opportunity going into the second half of the year jerry s rawls  executive chairman we expect that our datacom business is going to continue to grow and we expect that its going to be the strongest part of our business led by a hyperscale or web  data center but the challenge in that space is that there arent hundreds of customers there are a handful of customers and each one of them has their own characteristics of forecasting accepting delivery et cetera and they often are related to construction projects which have at least historically been pretty lumpy in terms of their stops and starts or unexpected delays subu subrahmanyan  the juda group understood thank you very much operator next question comes from troy jensen with piper troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker hi guys thank you a quick one for eitan and then i want to follow up with jerry but eitan given we saw some growth in wss and tunables id just like to gauge your confidence of a telco metro optical cycle starting whether its beginning of next year with a little bit of build in the second half but just your conviction on this now versus three months ago eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i think its safe to say we dont change the date i think the meaningful demand from this is beginning of next calendar year as the deployment i dont think have started significantly right now but it is happening from all the public announcements you see its happening and what was the other question troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker just a followup for jerry then on the datacom business id be curious to know like how good is the visibility there whether you can comment on how accurate they are for these rolling forecasts or has the booktobill been above one recently anything you can help us out with visibility would be great jerry s rawls  executive chairman booktobill is above one visibility in datacom it varies some most of our customers particularly enterprise customers are we operate on justintime hubs and so we have by classic definition no visibility on the day they want the product they pull it out of the hub they send us an electronic notice we ship them an electronic invoice and the transaction is complete but there was no visibility beyond the fact that they had given us a forecast and that we had inventory there available to pull with the web  group we have some inventory hubs that we provide but much of it is on orders that are shipped based on a purchase order so theres a little visibility there but it varies but overall in datacom visibility is limited to what our customers tell us theyre going to pull or theyre going to take troy d jensen  piper jaffray  co broker all right got it congrats and good luck in the july quarter jerry s rawls  executive chairman thanks operator we next move to joseph wolf with barclays joseph wolf  barclays capital inc thank you i wanted go back to the data center which i know has gotten a lot of attention but just the comments on the gig happening i wanted to verify that thats your second half of the calendar  and then could you just give us a little bit more detail have all the major hyperscale guys standardized on gig or do you think that some of the lumpiness is a decision thats waiting for to build out at gig versus a gig rollout jerry s rawls  executive chairman most of them almost all are taking gig products all will take gig products joseph wolf  barclays capital inc so the lumpiness  is it just a timing issue or its not an architecture decision jerry s rawls  executive chairman i think its an architecture decision its what switches did they buy what servers did they buy what are the slots that theyve invested in and then what is their transition plan to transition to the next faster piece of equipment and i think there are a number of them that are – theres been lots of publicity about broadcom and their tomahawk chipset and its availability in the second half of this year and systems that will actually be built and deployed with it so that will provide gig ports and multiples of gig its xgig so its mostly architectural joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay thats helpful and then i guess kurt i was just curious if you look at the mix i know theres some variability here and youve talked about building out the second two floors in china whats the plusses and minuses we could expect in gross margin going out for the year what would be a best case scenario if you got some operating leverage – or gross margin leverage on some volume through the china facility at the end of fiscal  kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer forecasting margin beyond one quarter is a very difficult thing there are just too many variables that go into it revenue growth product mix increases in capex so were not comfortable doing that so all i can provide you is our guidance for this quarter joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay thank you jerry s rawls  executive chairman having said that we wouldnt invest all that money in that beautiful new factory in china if we didnt think it was going to help kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer we think its going to help in that we think were going to have continued increased volume and we need the space and thats why were building out the two additional floors joseph wolf  barclays capital inc okay thats helpful thank you operator and well take our next question from ted moreau with barrington research theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc yes thank you i was just wondering you guys indicated that competition for your wireless products was picking up a little bit and i know that those products had historically been lower margin products so im just wondering at what point you decided to walk away from that business in wireless are you anywhere near that decision and then how aggressive can you be in terms of pricing in that product line jerry s rawls  executive chairman were going to be in that business as long as we can make money in that business and if the day comes when prices get so low that we say its not profitable to continue then well stop but generally we have a lot of capacity and when theres a lot of demand we can sell our capacity and get a reasonable price for it theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay and then kind of getting and stay on this gross margin topic what would it take to get gross margins up to say a  or  range i know you dont want to give a timeframe but can you get there based on simply volume do you need execution of all these cost improvements in wireless and optical engine and other products to get there or do we need a relief of the competitive dynamics what are going to be the big catalysts here or what could be kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think all of those factors are very important and i think they could all have a the big impact on margins both positively and negatively so i dont think we can again really forecast beyond the current quarter but well take it one quarter at a time theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc i understand that but im just kind of – is it possible to rate the factors or rank the factors that could potentially improve the gross margins to say at  or  jerry s rawls  executive chairman the product mix is always probably the most important factor probably followed by volume kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer those i think would be the two biggest i agree with jerry theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc and final question are there any products that are on the horizon that youre going to introduce i know you guys talked about all the rd to drive new product development is there anything on the horizon that you feel like could give you some more favorable pricing dynamics kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the area were clearly investing the most in relates to gig cfp and then i think as eitan talked about we expect to see more of those revenues in next calendar year eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director but in general i would say all the products we have the highest gross margin come from our newer product and the big coherence is a product line i mean the cfp currently is the first product of it so in the future we see more and more impact of those products coming into the mix of the gross margin and they affect it positively theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay jerry s rawls  executive chairman but were excited also about a whole series of products that are based on lane rates of  gigabits or  gigabits so multiples of  gigabits  x  gigabits is  gigabits  x  gigabits is  gigabits theres a number of products that will use the gigabit technology to provide really enormous bandwidth and our product portfolio in that area i dont – there are a number of products that will be introduced here over the next six months to nine months theodore joseph moreau  barrington research associates inc okay okay good luck gentlemen thank you so much operator and well take our next question from simon leopold with raymond james victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc hi guys this is victor chiu in for simon i wanted to ask a little bit about operating expenses i understand the opex in the next quarter will have these exceptional expenses from sales conference and the restricted stock units but how do we think about opex on a normalized basis going forward kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer again i think some of these expenses will definitely continue a lot of these expenses project material expenses that weve talked about related to qualification of the new product thats going to continue for many quarters some of that relates very much to the cfp that eitan talked about but also in the following second quarter we have our annual merit increases so i expect that to have a meaningful impact typically merit increases equate to approximately  million on the opex line so there will be some increases but as i mentioned earlier our ultimate goal is to get some operating leverage and ultimately reduce our opex to something around  of revenue but thats going to take some time and some revenue growth to get there so ive talked about in the past by early part of next fiscal year hopefully victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc okay thats helpful thank you i wanted to ask you how do you guys – what are you guys thinking about the g market for intradata center optics and kind of your timing for how long it takes to develop in terms of timing and ramp i guess jerry s rawls  executive chairman youre asking about intradata centers that means inside the data center victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc yes right right jerry s rawls  executive chairman its going to develop rapidly as equipment is deployed that has gig slots for optics to plug into it will develop it will follow those switches and those servers and thats going to happen – its going to start in a big way in the second half of this calendar year and will go into next fiscal – or next calendar year we expect it to be a very strong and very robust market victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc when do you expect to introduce the form factors like the clr or the psm is that the same timeframe jerry s rawls  executive chairman psm probably is next year thats single mode most of the – a lot of the offerings that were going to have in the space will be single mode in lr or will be multimode in sr victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc okay jerry s rawls  executive chairman sr as they refer to it victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc okay thats helpful and regarding the competitive piece i just wanted to dig just a little bit more there i guess who do you consider your key competitors inside the data center is it still the oclaro jdsu is avago still one of the guys that you see when youre talking about that space also jerry s rawls  executive chairman in the data center market the market share leaders for years have been finisar and avago and that hasnt changed but in the web  space theres a number of new entrants that are at least offering products there some more successfully than others but i still think that – but i dont think market share in the datacom space has changed victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc okay so its primarily in the web  space then correct jerry s rawls  executive chairman yes victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc great and lastly i just wanted to see if i could get a sense of your view around acquisitions maybe not any specific acquisitions although i think some people have one in mind specifically but just trying to get a sense of your priorities your logical priorities regarding the consolidation in the sector in general and your thoughts on consolidation jerry s rawls  executive chairman we are a modestly or moderately acquisitive company weve done i think since our ipo maybe  acquisitions most of them were pretty small most of them were for specific technologies and i am certain we will do more acquisitions in the future consolidation would be one motivation to do an acquisition and i believe strongly in consolidation as an important part of a healthy market but i cant predict when any consolidation transaction is likely to be available so were interested victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc okay great thank you operator and we move next to richard shannon with craighallum richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc hi guys thanks for taking my questions a couple from me first of all i think you referenced gross margins doing a little better than expected due to better yields in the optical engine im wondering how good those are compared to overall corporate averages and where you think that can go and really where can the volumes go and can we see a positive mix shift from that a quarter or two down the road kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer what i would say is we talked last time about how it was having about  basis points impact on our margin in q and i think we made great strides during this quarter to make up most of that and i think in general in terms of thinking about gross margin in the future i wouldnt bake in any additional material improvement on the overall gross margin based on that certainly with all our products though we continue to work on reducing costs and improving yields but again this is still as of now a relatively small part of our business but hopefully it will grow over the coming years but we have made some good progress over the last quarter richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay and is this a product that were seeing from just a single customer or are there more than one or do you expect more than one here in the near future jerry s rawls  executive chairman most of our revenue comes today from a couple of customers but we have a number of them that are lined up in the wings that are either in some stage of evaluation or qualification richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay is there any timeframe by which this becomes a meaningful product category for you like a year out as an example any clarity you can give for this on that jerry jerry s rawls  executive chairman we have high hopes in this area because we think it is a pretty amazing product to be able to supply as much bandwidth in as small a package as these optical engines do i think is a very attractive packaging alternative for anybody building a system or building a motherboard so our expectations are that were going to see dramatic growth in this product line over the next couple of years maybe forever we just think that its a product whose time has come and the applications for it are going to increase every year richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay i appreciate the detail there jerry i have one followon question here on the topic of cfp coherent how would you play out the competitive environment here where do you think your share will sit or your share rank any general thoughts as we look out a couple quarters a year or so how should we view that eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director we think we have a very competitive product we think from the best of our knowledge is we have the only product in the market thats already sampling that does gig and gig on the same device as it is today so your limitation is on your dsp not on the optics and going forward our plan is to get a significant market share what that will be time will tell but were treating it extremely seriously all the components are made inside so we are fully vertically integrated on the product and as we come into ga the full product is going to be manufactured in our asian facility so its planned to be a significant ramp for us richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay eitan how important is it to have a gig versus just gig for that product category eitan gertel  chief executive officer  director i think its more important on the later generations than immediate but when people are getting the product they have both capabilities available for them day one from us effectively if you can run gig your cost per bit is close to  than what you run on gig because the cost of the hardware is the same but i think from that point of view its important but the timing when people are actually utilizing the gig versus the gig will depend on the customers themselves but we believe getting into the market with a product that enables it day one is a significant improvement or significant edge richard cutts shannon  craighallum capital group llc okay great i appreciate the detail guys thank you much operator and our next question comes from alex henderson with needham  company alex henderson  needham  co llc i get a followup great so im a little confused about exactly whats going on in wuxi if somebody could give us a little bit more clarity around it it sounds like on the one hand you had a little bit less capex in the quarter that just occurred that you are accelerating capex spend for the upcoming quarter a little bit above what you had expected before is that a function of you changing the rate at which youre building those new rooms out and therefore choosing to alter the pattern of the spend in order to facilitate that or is that going to cause – are you behind schedule or on schedule relative to the original timeline for the build completion that you had originally scheduled for the end of april and relative to that extra capacity is that a reflection – should we read into it a reflection of faster transition out of shanghai and into this building where are we on actually shutting down the shanghai side of it but could you give us some of the pings and pongs on that its hard for us externally to track it kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so lets first talk about the capex related to our original plan for the second wuxi building including fitting out the first two floors again that capex is just lumpy and a little bit of it got pushed into the first quarter but that building is done now and those two floors are fitted out and were in the process of starting to move stuff into those floors and i think as weve said before that will take probably several more quarters for that to move that out and at that time then our shanghai facility will be primarily just a rd and npi facility so we expect that to be completed lets say in the next six months or so once some of the qualifications are done in terms of fitting out the additional two floors thats a decision were making now so that its finished by the end of next fiscal year so that we can be ready to hopefully accommodate additional volumes in fiscal  and so a lot of these decisions to add facility or add capacity you need to be thinking at least  months in advance and thats what were doing alex henderson  needham  co llc okay so just so i understand the costs associated with this transition weve been carrying around a lot of costs for training bussing people back and forth between the various facilities i assume that some of these costs that youve been carrying start to fall out as you bring up the capacity over the next couple of quarters is that the right way to think about it and isnt your cost structure substantially lower here than it is in shanghai therefore shouldnt those two factors help you deliver an improvement in margins as we go over the next two quarters or three quarters other things being equal kurt adzema  executive vice president and chief financial officer i do think well see some benefit once we have completely moved manufacturing out of shanghai which again we expect in about six months once the qualifications are done and so we should see some benefit from that so i think thats important in terms of any difference between wages in wuxi and wages in shanghai i mean right now as we sit weve already filled up our full building in wuxi so weve already seen some of that benefit so that small incremental amount of stuff that still needs to get moved from shanghai to wuxi will we see a little bit of benefit sure but weve already seen some of that benefit because we moved a complete building and we filled up that building with workers that are in wuxi right now alex henderson  needham  co llc is it fair to say that a good part of the pressure in your margins over the last  months has been a result of some of this transitionary pressure and as this falls out you should get some of that margin back that youve given up or is that too naive that its a really function of product and volumes and you actually have had competitive pressures that are altering the equation and i guess at the end of the day are you guys more or less or just about the same in terms of how bullish you are about your business it sounds really muddled to us from the comments you dont want to seem to want to commit to any meaningful trajectory on change on anything whether its product lines or growth or cost structure why so muddled jerry s rawls  executive chairman i apologize for being muddled we are optimistic about our business were building new factories because we think were going to need the volumes we expect that optics are going to continue to grow and the principal driver right now is the web  space and then next year its going to be big in telecom with all of the metro buildouts so i apologize again we dont want to be muddled we are optimistic so we dont give guidance beyond the next quarter and thats been our policy for a long time so alex henderson  needham  co llc that was very helpful thank you jerry it just helps to get defensive whether you guys are bullish or nervous thanks operator and ladies and gentlemen that does conclude todays questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr jerry rawls for closing remarks jerry s
