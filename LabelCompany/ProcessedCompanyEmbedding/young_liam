benefits of failure date thursday june   time  –   doors open location trouwamsterdam address wibautstraat  amsterdam can we benefit from failure is there live after modernism can dystopia be productive is there a future for architecture criticism in the last two years failed architecture has explored the dark and disastrous side of architecture from long neglected industrial ruins and abandoned new towns to britain’s riottorn neighborhoods and the corporate takeover in selloutcities throughout our series of talkshows ‘failed architecture’ was almost unanimously by architects and nonarchitects alike regarded as an oxymoron architecture itself cannot fail people and politics are the main causes for malfunctioning buildings and areas and therefore architects can never be held solely responsible for the criticism that their creations rightly or wrongly are exposed to during our season finale the last talkshow before the summer we move beyond the ruin porn and blind futurism of yesteryear and will bring a wide range of perspectives on the success of failure the resilience of architecture and the architect’s responsibility in a ravaged world leave a comment name required
