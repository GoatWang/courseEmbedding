competition from companies offering the same products and services as flagship there are five categories that include companies offering some variation of the products and services offered by flagship · institutionbased primary and specialty healthcare service suppliers comprised of either single hospital or clinics or a network of medical centers aiming to provide personalized access to emergency episodic or chronic care these competitors provide guidance services that primarily include access to their institutions resources the institutions most often determine which physician will see the patient examples include the executive registry of most leading hospitals and clinics and pinnacle healthcare · concierge medicine generally refers to a model whereby patients essentially pay an annual fee for special service rendered primarily by a primary care physician individual physicians charge an annual fee to an exclusive set of patients in their region the program allows primary care doctors to reduce their practice size and increase the time spent with participants in the program this service is designed for patients who are seeking personalized healthcare alternatives and from physicians who are tired of dealing with health care insurance providers and hmos examples include mdvip and md · best physician identifiers are third parties utilizing a combination of physician rankings by the media and cross references among physicians to identify best physicians typically there is a membership fee charged to both the patient for access and the physicians for listing in these arrangements physicians are typically chosen based on the list published by medical institutions with which the physicians are affiliated examples include best doctors and mediguide · web search services compile and offer lists of physicians with basic information about each physician this may includes services that compile lists of physicians and basic information about each physician an example is webmd · billing and insurance facilitators services include review of benefits negotiation of procedures and claim disputes on behalf of the memberpatient an example is health advocate
