opinion of management all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of only normal recurring adjustments the results of operations presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the  months ending december     use of estimates in the preparation of the financial statements   the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap which requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods presented we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods  green endeavors inc and subsidiaries notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited note  – summary of significant accounting policies   cash and cash equivalents   investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents as of march   and december   green had no cash equivalents   inventory   inventory consists of items held for resale and is carried at the lower of cost or market cost is determined using the first in first out “fifo” method  management has determined that no reserve is required at march     property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment are stated at historical cost depreciation is generally provided over the estimated useful lives using the straightline method as follows   leasehold improvements shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life computer equipment and related software years    furniture and fixtures years    equipment years    vehicle years    signage years      longlived assets   we periodically review the carrying amount of our longlived assets for impairment an asset is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not considered recoverable the asset is adjusted to its fair value fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flow there were no impairments of longlived assets as of march   and december     fair value measurements   the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices fair value measurements do not include transaction costs a fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories     level  quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities    level  observable marketbased inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data    level  unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data    revenue recognition   there are two primary types of revenue for the company  providing hair salon services and  selling hair salon products revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed or the product is delivered all revenue sources are domestic in some cases such as the sale of gift cards revenue is deferred until the gift card is redeemed   deferred revenue   deferred revenue arises when customers pay for products andor services in advance of receiving the product or service green’s deferred revenue consists solely of unearned revenue associated with the purchase of gift certificates for which revenue is recognized  green endeavors inc and subsidiaries notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited only when the service is performed or the product is delivered as of march   and december   deferred revenue was  and  respectively   advertising   the company expenses advertising production costs as they are incurred and advertising communication costs the first time the advertising takes place for the three month period ended march   and  advertising costs amounted to  and  respectively   stockbased compensation   green recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments as stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the restricted stock award option or purchase right and is recognized as expense less expected forfeitures over the requisite service period which typically equals the vesting period because the employee is expected to and has historically received shares of common stock on or about the date of the employee stock option grant date as part of the exercise process the fair value of each stock issuance is determined using the fair value of green’s common stock on the grant date   income taxes   deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date also greens practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense green is  consolidated into its parent company sakl and therefore does not file an income tax return its financial amounts are consolidated into the sakl income tax returns as of march   and december   a  valuation allowance has been placed against the deferred tax asset and therefore is not reflected on the balance sheets   net loss per share   net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the specified period diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares during the specified period for the three months ended march   there were  potential common shares not included in the diluted net loss per share calculation as their effect would be antidilutive such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce net loss per share   recent accounting pronouncements   management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates which are not yet effective will not have a material impact on green’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows upon adoption   note  – inventory   green’s inventory consists of items held for resale

dictate a maximum numbers of convertible shares the ability to settle these obligations with shares would be unavailable causing these obligations to potentially be settled in cash this condition creates a derivative liability under asc  the company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under asc  derivatives and hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion features should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings if the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under asc  the instrument is evaluated under asc  debt with conversion and other options for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature  embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the company’s balance sheet the company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change the company has estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives for convertible debenture using a multinomial lattice model as of march   as of march   the fair market value of the derivatives aggregated  and recorded a gain on market to market of  using the following assumptions estimated  year

of products the third subsidiary landis experience center llc is a retail aveda™ experience center   revenue   we generate revenue through the sale of services and products in the hair salon industry for the three month periods ended march   and  we had net revenue of  and  respectively   three months ended march   and    the following table shows the change in service revenue by salon for the three month periods ended march   and        three months ended march    increase decrease over prior period salon         dollar  liberty heights                          marmalade                     city creek                                                    as can be seen from the above table our three locations experienced an increase of  in service revenues for the three month period ending march   over the comparable period of service sales for  this increase is mostly resulting from an increase in staff that are now producing at sustainable levels   the following table shows the change in product revenue by salon for the three month periods ended march   and        three months ended march    increase decrease over prior period salon         dollar  liberty heights                        marmalade                     city creek                                                  as can be seen from the above table our three locations experienced a decrease of  in product revenues for the three month period ended march   over the comparable period of product sales for  this decline in product revenue is primarily due to the companys senior staff spending more time in our training programs for new artists   costs of revenue   three months ended march   and    the following table shows cost of revenue by type as a percentage of related revenue for the three month periods ended march   and      three months ended march  revenue type       service       product         the above table shows the cost of services revenue as a percentage of service revenue increasing by  for the three month period ended march   over the comparable period for  this increase in service cost is primary due to the company having more  new employees who have become senior stylists and are earning a higher commission rate the  decrease in product costs as a percentage of product sales for the same comparable periods is primarily due to normal fluctuations in the purchase price of product   operating expenses   three months ended march   and    the following table shows general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   and        three months ended march          salaries and wages               rent             advertising             credit card merchant fees             insurance             utilities and telephone             professional services             repairs and maintenance             dues and subscriptions             office expense             travel             investor relations and company promotion             other               total general and administrative expenses                 the above table shows an increase of  in general and administrative expenses as can be seen above there are several increases and decreases in the various categories the most notable of which are those of professional services and investor relations and company promotion for an aggregate increase of  in the three month period ended march   compared to the three month period ended march    salaries and wages increased due to new management employment contracts  expenses related to professional services and investor relations and company promotions are not cyclical or recurring in nature and increased due to the timing of strategic decisions   depreciation expense for the three months ended march   was  compared to  for the comparable three months ended march   the increase of  is primarily due to certain fixed assets being added during the previous year   other income expense   three months ended march   and    other income expense for the three months ended march   was  compared to  for the three months ended march   an increase of  the increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense and a reduction of the loss on stock subscription receivable of      liquidity and capital resources   cash and investments in marketable securities as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of  of cash compared to  as of december   our primary sources of cash during the three month period ended march   were customer payments for salon services and products our primary uses of cash were for payments relating to salaries rent general operating expenses and payments on notes payable   working capital we had a working capital deficit of  as of march   our current assets were  which consisted of  in cash  in accounts receivable  in inventory  in prepaid expenses and  in notes receivable our total assets were  which included  in property and equipment net and  in other assets our current  liabilities were  including  in accounts payable and accrued expenses  due to related parties  in the current portion of convertible notes and notes payable  in deferred revenue and rents and a  derivative liability our longterm liabilities were  consisting of notes payable our total stockholders’ deficit at march   was    working capital decreased by  as of march   compared to december   primarily due to the decrease in cash   cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities include net loss adjusted for certain noncash charges as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities for the three month period ended march   was  compared to  used in operating activities for the same period in    cash flows from investing activities cash flow from investing activities for the three months ended march   was  compared to  for the three months ended march   a  difference the change was due primarily to payment made to related party note receivable   cash flows from financing activities cash flow from financing activities for the three months ended march   was  compared to  provided by financing activities for the three months ended march   a change of  the decrease is attributable to the issuance of notes payable in prior periods   other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources   we have insufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities due to negative working capital of  as of march   historically we have funded our cash needs from a combination of revenues carried payables sales of equity and debt transactions since we are not currently realizing net cash flows from our business we may need to seek financing to continue our operations prospective sources of funding could include shareholder loans equity sales or loans from other sources though no assurance can be given that such sources would be available or that any commitment of support is forthcoming to date   we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future   we expect to purchase property or equipment as part of our normal ongoing operations   going concern   our audit opinion for the year ended december   expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses and negative working capital these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern management’s plans to address our ability to continue as a going concern include raising additional funds to finance the operating and capital requirements through a combination of equity and debt financings while we are making our best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations   impact of inflation   we compensate some of our salon employees with percentage commissions based on sales they generate accordingly this provides us certain protection against inflationary increases as payroll expense is a variable cost of sales in addition we may increase pricing in our salons to offset any significant increases in wages and cost of services provided therefore we do not believe inflation has had a significant impact on the results of our operations   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of march   and december   we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item aii of sec regulation sk   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not required for smaller reporting companies pursuant to item  of regulation sk   item  controls and procedures  evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   we carried out an evaluation required by rule a of the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer or ceo and the chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules e and de under the exchange act as of march     the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this quarterly report on form q in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is performed every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures and to modifying them as circumstances warrant   based on evaluation as of march   the ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   changes in internal control over financial reporting   based on managements most recent evaluation of our companys internal control over financial reporting management determined that there were no changes in our companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter   inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within green endeavors inc have been detected   part ii other
