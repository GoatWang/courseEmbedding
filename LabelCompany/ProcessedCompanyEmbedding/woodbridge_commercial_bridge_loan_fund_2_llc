commercial mortgage bridge loans home  finance   commercial mortgage bridge loansmay commercial mortgage bridge loans   financethere are several reasons why the mortgage bridge loans are so safethe company putting these deals together does extensive financial underwriting of the commercial real estate borrower to make absolutely sure they are in great financial position to be able to repay the loan interest and principal as agreed in many cases they have dealt with the same borrowers for many years and have a long track record with themyou as the lender are placed in first position on the mortgage note so you have priority over any other creditors and are fully securedthe commercial property is appraised conservatively by an independent appraiserthe maximum the borrower is allowed to borrow is   of the property’s value example  loantovalue ratio ltv so there is plenty of equity to fall back on in the super unlikely case that the property had to be foreclosed on the company guarantees in writing that it will make all payments of interest and principal to you the lender in case the underlying borrower does not make any interest or principal payments when due there is also a reserve fund already set aside with millions of dollars to make those payments even though it has never been usedthe mortgage bridge loan does not tradeand therefore your principal is always safe and you get your principal back in  months in contrast you may earn a  yield from a stock bond or mutual fund but that security can drop in value far more than  quickly wiping out the net impact of the yield you receive your stock bond or mutual fund may never recover so your principal is not secureif you have an ira or roth ira or sep ira or any other tax qualified plan you can roll it over to a self directed ira at provident trust which is set up to handle mortgage bridge loans and use the money to invest in the mortgage bridge programcall us at  for more information —about the
