undercurrent john allison‚Äôs unconventional wisdom about the financial crisis business  economics fall  by carl svanberg december   what caused the financial crisis here‚Äôs one answer representing conventional wisdom ‚Äúwe had weak regulation we had little oversight and what did it get us    a financial sector where irresponsibility and lack of basic oversight nearly destroyed our entire economy‚Äù that of course is president obama laying the blame for the financial crisis on the free market but does it make sense is it true no argues john a allison in his new book¬†the financial crisis and the free market cure why pure capitalism is the world economy‚Äôs only hope there are other books on the financial crisis why then bother with this one the answer is its author few people have greater understanding of the financial crisis than john allison mr allison has almost  years‚Äô worth of experience in banking including 9 years as the ceo for bbt during his time as ceo bbt‚Äôs assets grew from  billion to  billion this made it into one of the largest banks in the us it‚Äôs no mystery that he made it onto¬†harvard business review‚Äòs list of the top  most successful ceos in the world his widely recognized achievements and understanding of the free market were both reasons he recently became the new president of the cato institute mr allison‚Äôs experience in banking particularly during the financial crisis lends him credibility when he identifies government interference in the economy as the basic cause of the financial crisis indeed bbt didn‚Äôt engage in subprime lending precisely because mr allison early on recognized subprime loans as a hazardous product of a banking system thoroughly distorted by regulations as a matter of fact allison deems banking to be one of the most regulated industries in america‚Äîthe primary regulator being the federal reserve the federal reserve is the central bank of the united states a government entity whose authority to regulate interest rates by increasing or decreasing the money supply is enforced by the federal reserve act of 9 the federal reserve laid the foundation for the housing bubble in the early s by keeping interest rates artificially low and thereby making borrowing unusually affordable for a while interest rates were actually lower than the general rise in prices in effect people got paid to borrow money no wonder then that people were eagerly taking on unprecedented levels of mortgage debt on the premise that homeownership was a ‚Äúright‚Äù governmentsponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac guaranteed loans for as many americans as possible including lowincome families with little or no credit freddie and fannie thereby created a new and growing market for these socalled subprime loans‚Äîprecisely the sort of loans bbt refused to give freddie and fannie ended up guaranteeing loans worth trillions of dollars consequently millions of americans including many lowincome families jumped on the homeownership bandwagon and began bidding up prices for houses the housing bubble was born other forms of government interference contributed to inflating the housing bubble allison cites among others the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic encouraged banks to act irresponsibly by helping them realize that the government wouldn‚Äôt allow them to fail for the same reason most people wouldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt consider the reputation track record or financial status of their banks and while the fdic encouraged some banks to act irresponsibly the community reinvestment act forced other banks to lend to lowincome families who wouldn‚Äôt normally be able to afford it fearing that they had already expanded the monetary supply too much the federal reserve then raised the interest rates in  as expected those who had been thinking about buying a house gave up that idea because they now couldn‚Äôt afford a mortgage loan for the same reason many who for a time had been able to afford their mortgage loan were now instead forced to sell their house housing demand fell and so did housing prices the housing bubble burst the economy as a whole lost trillions of dollars soon defaults on loans led to failed banks this was the beginning of a long chain of events leading up to the great recession so much for the assertion that the financial crisis was caused by the lack of regulations and government oversight the free market isn‚Äôt to blame since there is no free market to blame the ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù of the real culprit‚Äîthe government‚Äîare all over the place what then is the cure to our current predicament a major part of the solution is to get the government out of banking the fed should not have the power to distort the interest rates by artificially increasing or decreasing the money supply interest rates should instead be determined by the market the government shouldn‚Äôt guarantee loans or force banks to give loans to people with bad credit instead the rational judgment and selfinterest of the bankers‚Äînot anyone‚Äôs need or desire for a house‚Äîshould determine who will get a loan for a house and under what conditions furthermore the government should not insure anyone‚Äôs deposits each person should protect his deposit with his own rational judgment if banks aren‚Äôt trustworthy no one will deal with them and competing banks will win their business instead this means that banks will have to earn the trust of their customers by spending years of building up a spotless reputation banks should not be bailed out by the government if they make mistakes or act irrationally they suffer the consequence not the taxpayers this will encourage banks to act more rationally with regard to their longrange profit the solution is in other words free banking as expected the very market forces which deliver the goods in every other industry will also deliver the goods in the banking industry allison‚Äôs analysis doesn‚Äôt stop at politics and economics he goes deeper arguing that the fundamental cause of the financial crisis is our society‚Äôs moral code most people think of homeownership as a desirable thing indeed it‚Äôs regarded as a part of the american dream it‚Äôs sometimes even regarded as a ‚Äúright‚Äù it is thought that we have a moral duty to sacrifice ourselves for the needy because they are needy therefore the government should help the poor and needy to get a loan for a house that‚Äôs how we ended up with freddie and fannie it‚Äôs also worth noting that the various government
