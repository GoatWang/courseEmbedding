in the press nicholas carlson jun    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print googlelets return to the case of jeff huber googles senior vice president of geo and commerce last week we published a story headlined depending on whom you ask this google exec is either weak or he just drew the short straw the story posed this question is huber as one source told us the weakest and least respected member on google ceo larry pages staff – or – has huber unfairly earned that reputation over the past year because he took on a difficult and sometimes messy job making some talkative enemies in the process in the week since weve spoken to several senior sources at google and its become clear that in the perspective of these longtime executives the answer is the latter  their view is that huber is a topnotch google executive who asked for the hardest challenge his boss could give him and he got it – in the form of nascent unproven products and an executive reporting to him that ended up being vastly underqualified for her job this is the story those sources told us google declined to comment we were unable to reach huber get the latest google stock price here continue reading »

illinoisdepartment of electrical and computer engineering university of illinois at urbanachampaign mobile nav jeff huber field report doug peterson story highlightsjeff huber bscompe  grew up on a small dairy farm near galena illinois today this ece illinois alumnus recently completed his th year as an executive with the searchengine giant google where he has played leadership roles in developing and improving landmark products such as google maps google earth and gmailhubers passion for computing goes back to age  when he took apart and reassmbled his parents apple ii computerhuber paid his way through college after his freshman year by selling computer supplies and software he simultaneously studied and operated his business fulltime through the business and technology center near campus and through this gained valuable entrepreneurship skills jeff huber bscompe ’ grew up on a small dairy farm near galena ill and has a vivid memory of standing in the cow yard as a young boy with manure coming to the top of his boots “there has to be a better way” he recalls thinking “i loved growing up on the farm but that moment convinced me that i should explore another option” that “other option” became computing today this ece illinois alumnus recently completed his th year as an executive with the searchengine giant google where he has played leadership roles in developing and improving landmark products such as google maps google earth and gmail he also led technology development for google ads the part of the business that transformed the company from a  billion business to a  billion business jeff huber at ece illinois huber was inspired by illinois’ pioneering work on internet technologies but his passion for computers goes back to age  when his family received its first apple ii computer  “to the horror of my parents i took it apart and then put it back together modifying it doing anything that could be done” he says  huber is the youngest of five children and his parents told each of them that the first year of college would be covered but they would have to make money to pay for rest of their education  this inspired huber to be an entrepreneur and start his own computer business at age  selling computer supplies and software as well as developing software when he came to illinois he continued to operate the company fulltime at the business and technology center a business incubator near campus  “it was a phenomenal experience” he says “i learned what it takes to be an entrepreneur how to create something from nothing and how to prioritize among the many things you can do” this early experience served him well when he worked as a vice president for both excitehome and ebay before joining google in  when he started at google the search engine had been established as a great product but he says the system for how google was going to make money was still “a bit of a backwater” with his leadership google ads flourished “a huge part of the task was defining the strategy and building the team and the culture to make it work” he says google encourages employees to spend  percent of their time pursuing passion projects so huber made bootstrapping google apps his side project he went on to lead development in google apps from  to  — a period when one of its most popular apps gmail took off gmail set itself apart from other email systems because of its massive amount of storage and ability to run email searches as he explains “if google could index every page on the web and give you a result back within  milliseconds why couldn’t people be able to find the attachment someone sent them last week in their email inboxes” in  huber moved to google maps where he already had some involvement when he first joined the company he helped google connect with and purchase a small company keyhole which served as a prototype for what became google earth —the system that allows people to view satellite and streetlevel images just about anywhere in the world in  he began looking for new challenges because as the head of google maps and commerce he ran a person organization in  locations around the world and that meant a lot of time spent on administrative chores “i wanted to get back to creating and building” he says therefore he switched to googlex the secretive division that tackles projects that seem more science fiction than reality google calls them “moonshots” and they include such highprofile projects as google glass wearable computing and selfdriving cars to qualify as a googlex project it has to be something that solves a huge problem affecting a billion or more people and uses breakthrough technology created at googlex that might lead to a radically innovative product within five to  years huber is a senior vice president in googlex’s life sciences area which has announced several initiatives one product is a contact lens that diabetics can use to continuously monitor glucose levels in tear fluid the contact lenses send glucose level readings to smartphones but a future version may allow wearers to do a “long blink” to trigger a visual display in the lens another project includes using nanoparticles to detect disease within the body with the first target being early diagnosis of cancer  googlex sets its sights high with these moonshots increasing the risk of failure — but also increasing the rewards of success  “with the ambitious projects were working on theres a percent chance of failure” huber says “but in the  percent where we succeed we can have a huge impact on the world ill take those odds any day” this story first appeared in the spring  issue of resonance ece illinois biannual magazine more field reports field report richard toepfer
