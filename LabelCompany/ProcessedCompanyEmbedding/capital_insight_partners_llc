starting an enterprise having  employees or less you will be a small business owner and in the company  million small businesses of which  million are self employed if you are a home based business you will be among the  of all small businesses yes a whooping  start a home business so you have to consider more than planning ahead finding a location  could be your home as a business location and getting the equipment and or inventory that you need to begin selling your merchandise or services starting a small employer or self employed business absolutely requires certain legal steps such as selecting the business legal structure and the licenses and tax registrations peculiar to your type of business some registrations are standard  ie uniform for all businesses including home online or for street vendors such as a general business license that is required by all businesses in addition to other specific licenses and tax registrations that your particular type of business needs if you are planning to start a business without employees there are about  million such businesses in the us and  of these nonemployer report less than  thousand per year in gross receipts here is a break down of what legal registrations you need legal business structure a small business is a very important venture considering they create  of all new jobs and about  new such businesses start each month or  million new startups per year in the us and more than  of all employees are small business employees so you have to make it a legal entity the government wants you to select a legal structure so you can be taxed accordingly for example a sole proprietorship is taxed differently from a limited liability company thus starting a business requires the selection of one of several structures but the most common are the following  sole proprietorship  limited liability company  corporation  c s or nonprofit  partnership  general and limited if you are starting a self employed business as most

you have questions about what structure to select you may want to educate yourself by reading this article about which one is the best for your situation example marie and juana wanted to start a marijuana business because of the two names composing the marijuana name but instead of being high decided to be law abiding and rolled the joint into a business online from home selling regular merchandise paraphernalia such as babies clothing and toys as well as seks  x omitted for obvious reasons toys from their website as well as on ebay and amazon or etsy marie and juana will have to select a legal structure first because all other tax and licenses registrations will be filed under that structure marie and juana can start as a general partnership a limited partnership an llc or a corporation the general partnership requires a business name registration  aka dba doing business as filing so general partnerships need at least a federal tax id number a business license and an assumed business name registration also called a fictitious business name or dba even if the business name is the personal name of one of the partners such as jones and associates the dba filing is a certificate that must be recorded and the main information in it is the business name the owners name and their addresses however if the partnership files a limited liability company or incorporates the name does not have to be registered on the other hand the small business is a sole proprietor it does need to file a business name registration only if the business name is different from the full owners legal name for example if the owners legal name is juana j jones and does business with that name without any other trade name eg juanas boutique she does not have to file a dba but janes boutique requires a dba registration despite that juana could file an llc or form a corporation and she would not have to file a dba self employed small businesses have an average of  annual gross income and the fastest growing freelance businesses are home businesses auto repair shops beauty salons dry cleaners and cleaning services but they are others including the latest ecigarettes e liquid or vape shops  after ten years only about  of small businesses survive but be of good cheer because this sector gross revenues are almost  trillion dollars an llc or corporation is a legal person a natural person like you and i has a social security number and a birth certificate a legal person is a person without a physical body but has a birth certificate that is created when the articles of organization for the llc or the articles of incorporation for the corporation is executed and filed with the state government  the articles can be  or more pages but normally it is just one page with the name of the corporate entity its officially declared business address and the registered agents name and address the register agent is a designated natural or legal person that receive the mail

forming an llc for example if the assumed business name is  deas xyztch capital insight partnersco this company name as well as any other business name must be filed with the clerk as a trade name registration and that requires a filing fee to be registered a trade registration is requred but if the owner wants to use the business name exclusively he or she cannot because anyone else can also file the same trade name nor does the trade name registration protects the owner from personal legal or financial liability as forming a limited liability company llc  it is perhaps a better choice to just incorporate for the same or a little higher fee because you will also have corporate protection for the business name and personal vs business liabilities eg if your business has debts the lender can sue you personally to obtain a judgment vs your personal assets as opposed in the case you were a corporation where the lender could only sue the corporation directly and if the limited liability company llc had no assets the lender could get nothing note that once you incorporate no one can register the limited liability company llc name at the state level q what if i am a very small company do i need a limited liability company llc a you do not need an llc however q does an llc without employees need a tax id number a an llc without employees may not need a tax id number but an llc with more than one owner does need one in addition if the llc is engaged in selling taxable items such as clothing it will need a sales state tax id number in addition to any other tax id q what if i an an out of state business do i still need to register and obtain a limited liability company llc a unless you have a location in the state you sell it is not required to form an llc there q when do i have to change my limited liability company llc a you may have to get a new tax id number if your status as a business changes for example if you change from sole owner to a partnership or from llc to corporation as well as when you buy a new business you need to get a new tax id under your business name or individual name q do i need to obtain a federal or state tax id number before forming a limited liability company llc or getting other licenses a q what are the benefits of havin a duns number a you can use it to your benefit by providing favorable business information to make it more likely to get a loan from a lender bank q do i need to pay sales tax to the state as an llc a paying sales tax depends on your state for example in oregon you dont need to pay sales tax but you still
