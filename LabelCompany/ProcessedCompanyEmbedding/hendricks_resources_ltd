mining dating back to the bronze age coal lead and copper mining flourished during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries following a period of relative decline the discovery of the tynagh lead zinc copper mine in  was followed by further discoveries at silvermines and gortdrum these mines have now closed but the development of the navan mine in  followed by the galmoy and lisheen mines means that ireland is a leading european producer of zinc and lead concentrates in europe httpwwwdcenrgovienaturalexploration base metal exploration discoveries continue with major companies including

policy is to support the development of irelands mineral resources provided this is done in an environmentally and socially responsible way the minerals development acts  to  are the principal legislative instruments which govern activity in this area  a new minerals development bill is currently being developed which will consolidate these acts and will also update and modernise many of their provisions the exploration and mining division emd is responsible for the administration of regulatory aspects of ireland’s minerals industry by means of a  system of prospecting licences and mining leases and licences  state mining facilities are negotiated on a case by case basis as required by section  of the minerals development act  which also applies to licences under the minerals development act  see section  of the  act key features • sole right of working minerals vested in the state • royalties fixed by individual agreement currently a percentage of net revenues for base metals and on tonnage extracted in the case of industrial minerals • private mineral owners receive compensation • corporation tax at  for mines and  on income and chargeable gains from general trading • capital allowances include exploration and development expenditure expenditure on plant machinery buildings up to  • immediate writeoff of exploration and development expenditure • cost of rehabilitation after closure is tax deductible   at the eu level the commission has recently launched an initiative aimed at acquiring secure supplies of raw material for european industry   irish exploration current outlook in february  hendrick resources and connemara mining plc cmc wwwconnemaramccom announced a joint venture which would begin exploration work on four cmc licenses on the wicklowwexford border a fifth license was added to the jv when cmc had fulfilled their first year commitment to the exploration  mining division prospecting licence terms the company can earn a  interest in these licences by spending € and may extend its option to  by investing a further € initial exploration has been completed with an airborne geophysical survey subsequent exploration will include ground geochemistry and geophysics with follow up drill testing the airborne magnetic electromagnetic  radiometric survey over the jv area started in april and was completed in may  total survey coverage was of  km  the survey was flown by terraquest geophysics a canadian company operating worldwide the new survey data is currently being combined with historical data on gold prospects in the area to inform the next phase of ground followup the first phase of this work will include regional soil sampling traverses over the zones identified from a combination of the new survey work and the historical datasets from previous operators  total field magnetics – merged with tara exploration  survey the results from the airborne survey have proven to contain many tantalizing targets which could fit to a variety of mineralization models some of these models are outlined below   generalised geological map for southeast ireland from gsi  map   the leinster granites to the west are
