the first quarter of  as increased yields on interestearning assets were offset by increases in costs of interestbearing liabilities as had been experienced in the first quarter of  increased yields on loans and investments reflected a higher interest rate environment in  additionally taxexempt securities were added to the portfolio in late  and early  with taxableequivalent yields higher than the portfolio average the cost of interestbearing liabilities has increased at a slower pace than the yields earned on interestearning assets in  as the market was initially slow to respond to interest rate changes provision for loan losses the company recorded a  thousand provision for loan losses for the three and six months ended june   compared with no provision expense for the same periods in  in calculating the required provision for loan losses both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses favorable historical chargeoff data combined with continued stable economic and market conditions resulted in the determination that a modest provision for loan losses in the second quarter of  was required to offset net chargeoffs and for loan growth experienced while asset quality metrics have improved throughout  and  as noted below the growth the company has experienced in its loan portfolio

over  investment securities gains totaled  thousand and  thousand for the three and six months ended june   compared with  and  million for the same periods in  as market conditions presented

with david meyer and i strongly recommend his firm to anyone who has a potential investment misconduct claim  rs esqcalifornia at a time in our life when we thought life would be easier because we had worked hard and carefully planned and saved for our golden years we discovered our stockbroker had lost our entire lifes savings we thought there was no hope of recovering any of it thats when we were referred to david meyer and associates mr meyer and his staff explained the arbitration process and gave us hope thanks to their hard work the arbitration and settlement process put us back on track they were a godsend when we needed them most  swkentucky i accepted an early retirement from my large employer after more than  years based on the recommendation of my stockbroker that i had plenty of

my coworkers were losing their retirement savings with the same brokerage firm i do not remember how i heard about david meyer  associates but they came to be my knight in shining armor hiring mr meyers law firm was probably the smartest thing ive done in my life dozens of my coworkers hired them too it took some time to get through the process but david and his firm did a great job for all of

that  he took on this large brokerage firmand won i have nothing but the highest praise for david meyer and his staff of very qualified people  rhohio we had never participated in any type of lawsuit
