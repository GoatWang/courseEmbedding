do you like bestkinvey provides me the opportunity to build hybrid web and iot apps using its platform without any need to setup and maintain a cloud based backend for the apps it takes care of the connection to the services and maintenance of the servers on its own i just need to focus on what the user experience should be when using the app it provides complete access to the enterprise applications via their service catalog and have a single protocol to query any language at the backend synchronized data is supported for a longer period of time so that my offline operations can be carried out without any problems or obstructions it uses data set which can optimize the performance of the app and uses less amount of internet data for the samewhat do you dislikeit lacks when it comes to running complex queries in the backend which are long scripts the performance gets downgraded at that time when the complex queries are getting executed and the processing time is long also it is not an ideal tool for someone who wants to build an app having customized backend with full controlrecommendations to others considering the productit offers a free trial to be used beforehand and decide if it suits your needs or notwhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedthe best thing about kinvey is that it can be instantly configured within seconds and rest apis can be implemented in the system successfully it also provides a faster bug analysis so that it doesn’t take much time to analyze the root cause of the bug and fix it multiple
