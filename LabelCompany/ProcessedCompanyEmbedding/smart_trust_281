prospectus blue sky estimated net annual first year distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding the estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge the actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities smart trust toggle navigation all solutions all solutions most popular the  habits of highly effective people your
