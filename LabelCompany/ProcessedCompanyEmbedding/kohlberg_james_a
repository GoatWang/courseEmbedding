encyclopedia   redirected from kohlbergs stages of moral development jump to navigation search lawrence kohlbergs stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the swiss psychologist jean piaget kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the university of chicago in  and expanded upon the theory throughout his life the theory holds that moral reasoning the basis for ethical behavior has six identifiable developmental stages each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by piaget who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages expanding on piagets work kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that it continued throughout the individuals lifetime a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research the six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels preconventional morality conventional morality and postconventional morality for his studies kohlberg relied on stories such as the heinz dilemma and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas he then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed rather than its conclusion and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages there have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values such as caring that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations by both decision makers and psychologists studying them of essentially intuitive decisions nevertheless an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of kohlbergs theory and according to haggbloom et als study of the most eminent psychologists of the th century kohlberg was the th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century as well as the th most eminent overall kohlbergs scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someones behavior is there should however be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible consistent and predictable from people at higher levels contents  stages  preconventional  conventional  postconventional  further stages  theoretical assumptions philosophy  formal elements  examples of applied moral dilemmas  criticisms  continued relevance  see also  references  further reading  external links stagesedit kohlbergs six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each preconventional conventional and postconventional following piagets constructivist requirements for a stage model as described in his theory of cognitive development it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities stages cannot be skipped each provides a new and necessary perspective more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them level  preconventional  obedience and punishment orientation how can i avoid punishment  selfinterest orientation whats in it for me paying for a benefit level  conventional  interpersonal accord and conformity social norms the good boygirl attitude  authority and socialorder maintaining orientation law and order morality level  postconventional  social contract orientation  universal ethical principles principled conscience the understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic lacking in sufficient attention to detail preconventionaledit the preconventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences the preconventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner a child with preconventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized societys conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring in stage one obedience and punishment driven individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves for example an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished the last time i did that i got spanked so i will not do it again the worse the punishment for the act is the more bad the act is perceived to be this can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering it is egocentric lacking recognition that others points of view are different from ones own there is deference to superior power or prestige an example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment for example a childs classmate tries to dare the child to skip school the child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished stage two selfinterest driven expresses the whats in it for me position in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider ones reputation or relationships to groups of people stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others but only to a point where it might further the individuals own interests as a result concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect but rather a you scratch my back and ill scratch yours mentality the lack of a societal perspective in the preconventional level is quite different from the social contract stage five as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individuals own needs or interests for the stage two theorist the worlds perspective is often seen as morally relative an example of selfinterest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore the child asks whats in it for me the parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores the child is motivated by selfinterest to do chores conventionaledit the conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults to reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to societys views and expectations the conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of societys conventions concerning right and wrong at this level an individual obeys rules and follows societys norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid however and a rules appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned in stage three good intentions as determined by social consensus the self enters society by conforming to social standards individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects societys views they try to be a good boy or good girl to live up to these expectations having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a persons relationships which now begin to include things like respect gratitude and the golden rule i want to be liked and thought well of apparently not being naughty makes people like me conforming to the rules for ones social role is not yet fully understood the intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that they mean well in stage four authority and social order obedience driven it is important to obey laws dictums and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three a central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong if one person violates a law perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules when someone does violate a law it is morally wrong culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones most active members of society remain at stage four where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force postconventionaledit the postconventional level also known as the principled level is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles postconventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life liberty and justice people who exhibit postconventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question because postconventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions their behavior especially at stage six can be confused with that of those at the preconventional levelcitation needed some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning in stage five social contract driven the world is viewed as holding different opinions rights and values such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people this is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning in stage six universal ethical principles driven moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws legal rights are unnecessary as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way as in the philosophy of immanuel kant this involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes if they believed what that other person imagines to be true the resulting consensus is the action taken in this way action is never a means but always an end in itself the individual acts because it is right and not because it avoids punishment is in their best interest expected legal or previously agreed upon although kohlberg insisted that stage six exists he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level further stagesedit in kohlbergs empirical studies of individuals throughout their life kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression this could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory kohlberg chose the latter postulating the existence of substages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality in particular kohlberg noted a stage ½ or  a transition from stage four to stage five that shared characteristics of both in this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable this stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—transcendental morality or morality of cosmic orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning kohlbergs difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage however led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage theoretical assumptions philosophyedit kohlbergs stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative capable of reason and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them the stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individuals actions or character arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments a position he calls formalism kohlbergs theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles despite being a justicecentered theory of morality kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia kohlbergs theory understands values as a critical component of the right whatever the right is for kohlberg it must be universally valid across societies a position known as moral universalism there can be no relativism moreover morals are not natural features of the world they are prescriptive nevertheless moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity according to kohlberg someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages for example an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments stage three to being a proponent of social contracts stage five on encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory however an individual will look to the next level realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last the process is therefore considered to be constructive as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individuals innate dispositions or a result of past inductions formal elementsedit progress through kohlbergs stages happens as a result of the individuals increasing competence both psychologically and in balancing conflicting socialvalue claims the process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called justice operation kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations equality which involves an impartial regard for persons and reciprocity which means a regard for the role of personal merit for kohlberg the most adequate result of both operations is reversibility in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation also known colloquially as moral musical chairs knowledge and learning contribute to moral development specifically important are the individuals view of persons and their social perspective level each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage the view of persons can be understood as the individuals grasp of the psychology of other persons it may be pictured as a spectrum with stage one having no view of other persons at all and stage six being entirely sociocentric similarly the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms examples of applied moral dilemmasedit kohlberg established the moral judgement interview in his original  dissertation during the roughly minute tape recorded semistructured interview the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses the dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision the participant is asked a systemic series of openended questions like what they think the right course of action is as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong the form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived a dilemma that kohlberg used in his original research was the druggists dilemma heinz steals the drug in europe criticismsedit one criticism of kohlbergs theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions carol gilligan has argued that kohlbergs theory is overly androcentric kohlbergs theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level  focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends men are likely to move on to the abstract principles and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved consistent with this observation gilligans theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice she developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring critics such as christina hoff sommers however argued that gilligans research is illfounded and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion kohlbergs stages are not culturally neutral as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures although they progress through the stages in the same order individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning rather than to those beliefs another criticism of kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements this often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage typically using more selfinterest driven reasoning ie stage two than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning ie stage four kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning carpendale has argued that kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules this view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives krebs and denton have also attempted to modify kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning social intuitionists such as jonathan haidt for example argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness law human rights or abstract ethical values thus the arguments analyzed by kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than kohlbergs theory suggests continued relevanceedit kohlbergs body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field one example is the defining issues test dit created in  by james rest originally as a pencilandpaper alternative to the moral judgement interview heavily influenced by the sixstage model it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test the likert scale to rate moral dilemmas similar to kohlbergs it also used a large body of kohlbergian theory such as the idea of postconventional thinking in  the dit was revised as the dit the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required such as divinity

kohlbergs stages of moral development from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from kohlbergs stages of moral development jump to navigation search lawrence kohlbergs stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the swiss psychologist jean piaget kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the university of chicago in  and expanded upon the theory throughout his life the theory holds that moral reasoning the basis for ethical behavior has six identifiable developmental stages each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by piaget who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages expanding on piagets work kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that it continued throughout the individuals lifetime a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research the six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels preconventional morality conventional morality and postconventional morality for his studies kohlberg relied on stories such as the heinz dilemma and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas he then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed rather than its conclusion and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages there have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values such as caring that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations by both decision makers and psychologists studying them of essentially intuitive decisions nevertheless an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of kohlbergs theory and according to haggbloom et als study of the most eminent psychologists of the th century kohlberg was the th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century as well as the th most eminent overall kohlbergs scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someones behavior is there should however be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible consistent and predictable from people at higher levels contents  stages  preconventional  conventional  postconventional  further stages  theoretical assumptions philosophy  formal elements  examples of applied moral dilemmas  criticisms  continued relevance  see also  references  further reading  external links stagesedit kohlbergs six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each preconventional conventional and postconventional following piagets constructivist requirements for a stage model as described in his theory of cognitive development it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities stages cannot be skipped each provides a new and necessary perspective more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them level  preconventional  obedience and punishment orientation how can i avoid punishment  selfinterest orientation whats in it for me paying for a benefit level  conventional  interpersonal accord and conformity social norms the good boygirl attitude  authority and socialorder maintaining orientation law and order morality level  postconventional  social contract orientation  universal ethical principles principled conscience the understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic lacking in sufficient attention to detail preconventionaledit the preconventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences the preconventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner a child with preconventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized societys conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring in stage one obedience and punishment driven individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves for example an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished the last time i did that i got spanked so i will not do it again the worse the punishment for the act is the more bad the act is perceived to be this can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering it is egocentric lacking recognition that others points of view are different from ones own there is deference to superior power or prestige an example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment for example a childs classmate tries to dare the child to skip school the child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished stage two selfinterest driven expresses the whats in it for me position in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider ones reputation or relationships to groups of people stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others but only to a point where it might further the individuals own interests as a result concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect but rather a you scratch my back and ill scratch yours mentality the lack of a societal perspective in the preconventional level is quite different from the social contract stage five as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individuals own needs or interests for the stage two theorist the worlds perspective is often seen as morally relative an example of selfinterest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore the child asks whats in it for me the parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores the child is motivated by selfinterest to do chores conventionaledit the conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults to reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to societys views and expectations the conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of societys conventions concerning right and wrong at this level an individual obeys rules and follows societys norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid however and a rules appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned in stage three good intentions as determined by social consensus the self enters society by conforming to social standards individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects societys views they try to be a good boy or good girl to live up to these expectations having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a persons relationships which now begin to include things like respect gratitude and the golden rule i want to be liked and thought well of apparently not being naughty makes people like me conforming to the rules for ones social role is not yet fully understood the intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that they mean well in stage four authority and social order obedience driven it is important to obey laws dictums and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three a central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong if one person violates a law perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules when someone does violate a law it is morally wrong culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones most active members of society remain at stage four where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force postconventionaledit the postconventional level also known as the principled level is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles postconventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life liberty and justice people who exhibit postconventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question because postconventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions their behavior especially at stage six can be confused with that of those at the preconventional levelcitation needed some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning in stage five social contract driven the world is viewed as holding different opinions rights and values such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people this is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning in stage six universal ethical principles driven moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws legal rights are unnecessary as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way as in the philosophy of immanuel kant this involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes if they believed what that other person imagines to be true the resulting consensus is the action taken in this way action is never a means but always an end in itself the individual acts because it is right and not because it avoids punishment is in their best interest expected legal or previously agreed upon although kohlberg insisted that stage six exists he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level further stagesedit in kohlbergs empirical studies of individuals throughout their life kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression this could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory kohlberg chose the latter postulating the existence of substages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality in particular kohlberg noted a stage ½ or  a transition from stage four to stage five that shared characteristics of both in this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable this stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—transcendental morality or morality of cosmic orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning kohlbergs difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage however led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage theoretical assumptions philosophyedit kohlbergs stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative capable of reason and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them the stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individuals actions or character arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments a position he calls formalism kohlbergs theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles despite being a justicecentered theory of morality kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia kohlbergs theory understands values as a critical component of the right whatever the right is for kohlberg it must be universally valid across societies a position known as moral universalism there can be no relativism moreover morals are not natural features of the world they are prescriptive nevertheless moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity according to kohlberg someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages for example an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments stage three to being a proponent of social contracts stage five on encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory however an individual will look to the next level realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last the process is therefore considered to be constructive as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individuals innate dispositions or a result of past inductions formal elementsedit progress through kohlbergs stages happens as a result of the individuals increasing competence both psychologically and in balancing conflicting socialvalue claims the process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called justice operation kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations equality which involves an impartial regard for persons and reciprocity which means a regard for the role of personal merit for kohlberg the most adequate result of both operations is reversibility in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation also known colloquially as moral musical chairs knowledge and learning contribute to moral development specifically important are the individuals view of persons and their social perspective level each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage the view of persons can be understood as the individuals grasp of the psychology of other persons it may be pictured as a spectrum with stage one having no view of other persons at all and stage six being entirely sociocentric similarly the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms examples of applied moral dilemmasedit kohlberg established the moral judgement interview in his original  dissertation during the roughly minute tape recorded semistructured interview the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses the dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision the participant is asked a systemic series of openended questions like what they think the right course of action is as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong the form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived a dilemma that kohlberg used in his original research was the druggists dilemma heinz steals the drug in europe criticismsedit one criticism of kohlbergs theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions carol gilligan has argued that kohlbergs theory is overly androcentric kohlbergs theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level  focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends men are likely to move on to the abstract principles and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved consistent with this observation gilligans theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice she developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring critics such as christina hoff sommers however argued that gilligans research is illfounded and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion kohlbergs stages are not culturally neutral as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures although they progress through the stages in the same order individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning rather than to those beliefs another criticism of kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements this often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage typically using more selfinterest driven reasoning ie stage two than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning ie stage four kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning carpendale has argued that kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules this view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives krebs and denton have also attempted to modify kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning social intuitionists such as jonathan haidt for example argue that individuals often make moral judgments without

constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the swiss psychologist jean piaget kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the university of chicago in  and expanded upon the theory throughout his life the theory holds that moral reasoning the basis for ethical behavior has six identifiable developmental stages each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by piaget who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages expanding on piagets work kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that it continued throughout the individuals lifetime a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research the six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels preconventional morality conventional morality and postconventional morality for his studies kohlberg relied on stories such as the heinz dilemma and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas he then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed rather than its conclusion and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages there have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values such as caring that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations by both decision makers and psychologists studying them of essentially intuitive decisions nevertheless an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of kohlbergs theory and according to haggbloom et als study of the most eminent psychologists of the th century kohlberg was the th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century as well as the th most eminent overall kohlbergs scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someones behavior is there should however be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible consistent and predictable from people at higher levels contents  stages  preconventional  conventional  postconventional  further stages  theoretical assumptions philosophy  formal elements  examples of applied moral dilemmas  criticisms  continued relevance  see also  references  further reading  external links stagesedit kohlbergs six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each preconventional conventional and postconventional following piagets constructivist requirements for a stage model as described in his theory of cognitive development it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities stages cannot be skipped each provides a new and necessary perspective more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them level  preconventional  obedience and punishment orientation how can i avoid punishment  selfinterest orientation whats in it for me paying for a benefit level  conventional  interpersonal accord and conformity social norms the good boygirl attitude  authority and socialorder maintaining orientation law and order morality level  postconventional  social contract orientation  universal ethical principles principled conscience the understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic lacking in sufficient attention to detail preconventionaledit the preconventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences the preconventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner a child with preconventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized societys conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring in stage one obedience and punishment driven individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves for example an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished the last time i did that i got spanked so i will not do it again the worse the punishment for the act is the more bad the act is perceived to be this can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering it is egocentric lacking recognition that others points of view are different from ones own there is deference to superior power or prestige an example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment for example a childs classmate tries to dare the child to skip school the child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished stage two selfinterest driven expresses the whats in it for me position in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider ones reputation or relationships to groups of people stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others but only to a point where it might further the individuals own interests as a result concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect but rather a you scratch my back and ill scratch yours mentality the lack of a societal perspective in the preconventional level is quite different from the social contract stage five as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individuals own needs or interests for the stage two theorist the worlds perspective is often seen as morally relative an example of selfinterest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore the child asks whats in it for me the parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores the child is motivated by selfinterest to do chores conventionaledit the conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults to reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to societys views and expectations the conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of societys conventions concerning right and wrong at this level an individual obeys rules and follows societys norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid however and a rules appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned in stage three good intentions as determined by social consensus the self enters society by conforming to social standards individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects societys views they try to be a good boy or good girl to live up to these expectations having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a persons relationships which now begin to include things like respect gratitude and the golden rule i want to be liked and thought well of apparently not being naughty makes people like me conforming to the rules for ones social role is not yet fully understood the intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that they mean well in stage four authority and social order obedience driven it is important to obey laws dictums and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three a central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong if one person violates a law perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules when someone does violate a law it is morally wrong culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones most active members of society remain at stage four where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force postconventionaledit the postconventional level also known as the principled level is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles postconventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life liberty and justice people who exhibit postconventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question because postconventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions their behavior especially at stage six can be confused with that of those at the preconventional levelcitation needed some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning in stage five social contract driven the world is viewed as holding different opinions rights and values such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people this is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning in stage six universal ethical principles driven moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws legal rights are unnecessary as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way as in the philosophy of immanuel kant this involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes if they believed what that other person imagines to be true the resulting consensus is the action taken in this way action is never a means but always an end in itself the individual acts because it is right and not because it avoids punishment is in their best interest expected legal or previously agreed upon although kohlberg insisted that stage six exists he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level further stagesedit in kohlbergs empirical studies of individuals throughout their life kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression this could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory kohlberg chose the latter postulating the existence of substages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality in particular kohlberg noted a stage ½ or  a transition from stage four to stage five that shared characteristics of both in this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable this stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—transcendental morality or morality of cosmic orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning kohlbergs difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage however led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage theoretical assumptions philosophyedit kohlbergs stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative capable of reason and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them the stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individuals actions or character arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments a position he calls formalism kohlbergs theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles despite being a justicecentered theory of morality kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia kohlbergs theory understands values as a critical component of the right whatever the right is for kohlberg it must be universally valid across societies a position known as moral universalism there can be no relativism moreover morals are not natural features of the world they are prescriptive nevertheless moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity according to kohlberg someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages for example an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments stage three to being a proponent of social contracts stage five on encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory however an individual will look to the next level realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last the process is therefore considered to be constructive as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individuals innate dispositions or a result of past inductions formal elementsedit progress through kohlbergs stages happens as a result of the individuals increasing competence both psychologically and in balancing conflicting socialvalue claims the process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called justice operation kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations equality which involves an impartial regard for persons and reciprocity which means a regard for the role of personal merit for kohlberg the most adequate result of both operations is reversibility in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation also known colloquially as moral musical chairs knowledge and learning contribute to moral development specifically important are the individuals view of persons and their social perspective level each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage the view of persons can be understood as the individuals grasp of the psychology of other persons it may be pictured as a spectrum with stage one having no view of other persons at all and stage six being entirely sociocentric similarly the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms examples of applied moral dilemmasedit kohlberg established the moral judgement interview in his original  dissertation during the roughly minute tape recorded semistructured interview the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses the dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision the participant is asked a systemic series of openended questions like what they think the right course of action is as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong the form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived a dilemma that kohlberg used in his original research was the druggists dilemma heinz steals the drug in europe criticismsedit one criticism of kohlbergs theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions carol gilligan has argued that kohlbergs theory is overly androcentric kohlbergs theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level  focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends men are likely to move on to the abstract principles and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved consistent with this observation gilligans theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice she developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring critics such as christina hoff sommers however argued that gilligans research is illfounded and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion kohlbergs stages are not culturally neutral as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures although they progress through the stages in the same order individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning rather than to those beliefs another criticism of kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements this often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage typically using more selfinterest driven reasoning ie stage two than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning ie stage four kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning carpendale has argued that kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules this view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives krebs and denton have also attempted to modify kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning social intuitionists such as jonathan haidt for example argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness law human rights or abstract ethical values thus the arguments analyzed by kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than kohlbergs theory suggests continued relevanceedit kohlbergs body of work on the stages of moral development has been

although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences the preconventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner a child with preconventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized societys conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring in stage one obedience and punishment driven individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves for example an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished the last time i did that i got spanked so i will not do it again the worse the punishment for the act is the more bad the act is perceived to be this can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering it is egocentric lacking recognition that others points of view are different from ones own there is deference to superior power or prestige an example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment for example a childs classmate tries to dare the child to skip school the child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished stage two selfinterest driven expresses the whats in it for me position in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider ones reputation or relationships to groups of people stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others but only to a point where it might further the individuals own interests as a result concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect but rather a you scratch my back and ill scratch yours mentality the lack of a societal perspective in the preconventional level is quite different from the social contract stage five as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individuals own needs or interests for the stage two theorist the worlds perspective is often seen as morally relative an example of selfinterest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore the child asks whats in it for me the parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores the child is motivated by selfinterest to do chores conventionaledit the conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults to reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to societys views and expectations the conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of societys conventions concerning right and wrong at this level an individual obeys rules and follows societys norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid however and a rules appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned in stage three good intentions as determined by social consensus the self enters society by conforming to social standards individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects societys views they try to be a good boy or good girl to live up to these expectations having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a persons relationships which now begin to include things like respect gratitude and the golden rule i want to be liked and thought well of apparently not being naughty makes people like me conforming to the rules for ones social role is not yet fully understood the intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that they mean well in stage four authority and social order obedience driven it is important to obey laws dictums and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three a central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong if one person violates a law perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules when someone does violate a law it is morally wrong culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones most active members of society remain at stage four where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force postconventionaledit the postconventional level also known as the principled level is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles postconventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life liberty and justice people who exhibit postconventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question because postconventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions their behavior especially at stage six can be confused with that of those at the preconventional levelcitation needed some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning in stage five social contract driven the world is viewed as holding different opinions rights and values such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people this is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning in stage six universal ethical principles driven moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws legal rights are unnecessary as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way as in the philosophy of immanuel kant this involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes if they believed what that other person imagines to be true the resulting consensus is the action taken in this way action is never a means but always an end in itself the individual acts because it is right and not because it avoids punishment is in their best interest expected legal or previously agreed upon although kohlberg insisted that stage six exists he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level further stagesedit in kohlbergs empirical studies of individuals throughout their life kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression this could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory kohlberg chose the latter postulating the existence of substages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality in particular kohlberg noted a stage ½ or  a transition from stage four to stage five that shared characteristics of both in this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable this stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—transcendental morality or morality of cosmic orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning kohlbergs difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage however led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage theoretical assumptions philosophyedit kohlbergs stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative capable of reason and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them the stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individuals actions or character arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments a position he calls formalism kohlbergs theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles despite being a justicecentered theory of morality kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia kohlbergs theory understands values as a critical component of the right whatever the right is for kohlberg it must be universally valid across societies a position known as moral universalism there can be no relativism moreover morals are not natural features of the world they are prescriptive nevertheless moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity according to kohlberg someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages for example an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments stage three to being a proponent of social contracts stage five on encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory however an individual will look to the next level realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last the process is therefore considered to be constructive as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individuals innate dispositions or a result of past inductions formal elementsedit progress through kohlbergs stages happens as a result of the individuals increasing competence both psychologically and in balancing conflicting socialvalue claims the process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called justice operation kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations equality which involves an impartial regard for persons and reciprocity which means a regard for the role of personal merit for kohlberg the most adequate result of both operations is reversibility in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation also known colloquially as moral musical chairs knowledge and learning contribute to moral development specifically important are the individuals view of persons and their social perspective level each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage the view of persons can be understood as the individuals grasp of the psychology of other persons it may be pictured as a spectrum with stage one having no view of other persons at all and stage six being entirely sociocentric similarly the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms examples of applied moral dilemmasedit kohlberg established the moral judgement interview in his original  dissertation during the roughly minute tape recorded semistructured interview the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses the dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision the participant is asked a systemic series of openended questions like what they think the right course of action is as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong the form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived a dilemma that kohlberg used in his original research was the druggists dilemma heinz steals the drug in europe criticismsedit one criticism of kohlbergs theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions carol gilligan has argued that kohlbergs theory is overly androcentric kohlbergs theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level  focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends men are likely to move on to the abstract principles and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved consistent with this observation gilligans theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice she developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring critics such as christina hoff sommers however argued that gilligans research is illfounded and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion kohlbergs stages are not culturally neutral as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures although they progress through the stages in the same order individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning rather than to those beliefs another criticism of kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements this often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage typically using more selfinterest driven reasoning ie stage two than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning ie stage four kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning carpendale has argued that kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules this view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives krebs and denton have also attempted to modify kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning social intuitionists such as jonathan haidt for example argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness law human rights or abstract ethical values thus the arguments analyzed by kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than kohlbergs theory suggests continued relevanceedit kohlbergs body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field one example is the defining issues test dit created in  by james rest originally as a pencilandpaper alternative to the moral judgement interview heavily influenced by the sixstage model it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test the likert scale to rate moral dilemmas similar to kohlbergs it also used a large body of kohlbergian theory such as the idea of postconventional thinking in  the dit was revised as the dit the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required such as divinity

stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the swiss psychologist jean piaget kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the university of chicago in  and expanded upon the theory throughout his life the theory holds that moral reasoning the basis for ethical behavior has six identifiable developmental stages each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by piaget who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages expanding on piagets work kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that it continued throughout the individuals lifetime a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research the six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels preconventional morality conventional morality and postconventional morality for his studies kohlberg relied on stories such as the heinz dilemma and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas he then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed rather than its conclusion and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages there have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values such as caring that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations by both decision makers and psychologists studying them of essentially intuitive decisions nevertheless an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of kohlbergs theory and according to haggbloom et als study of the most

 a transition from stage four to stage five that shared characteristics of both in this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable this stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—transcendental morality or morality of cosmic orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning kohlbergs difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage however led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage theoretical assumptions philosophyedit kohlbergs stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative capable of reason and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them the stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individuals actions or character arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments a position he calls formalism kohlbergs theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles despite being a justicecentered theory of morality kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia kohlbergs theory understands values as a critical component of the right whatever the right is for kohlberg it must be universally valid across societies a position known as moral universalism there can be no relativism moreover morals are not natural features of the world they are prescriptive nevertheless moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity according to kohlberg someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages for example an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments stage three to being a proponent of social contracts stage five on encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory however an individual will look to the next level realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last the process is therefore considered to be constructive as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individuals innate dispositions or a result of past inductions formal elementsedit progress through kohlbergs stages happens as a result of the individuals increasing competence both psychologically and in balancing conflicting socialvalue claims the process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called justice operation kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations equality which involves an impartial regard for persons and reciprocity which means a regard for the role of personal merit for kohlberg the most adequate result of both operations is reversibility in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation also known colloquially as moral musical chairs knowledge and learning contribute to moral development specifically important are the individuals view of persons and their social perspective level each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage the view of persons can be understood as the individuals grasp of the psychology of other persons it may be pictured as a spectrum with stage one having no view of other persons at all and stage six being entirely sociocentric similarly the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms examples of applied moral dilemmasedit kohlberg established the moral judgement interview in his original  dissertation during the roughly minute tape recorded semistructured interview the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses the dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision the participant is asked a systemic series of openended questions like what they think the right course of action is as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong the form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived a dilemma that kohlberg used in his original research was the druggists dilemma heinz steals the drug in europe criticismsedit one criticism of kohlbergs theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions carol gilligan has argued that kohlbergs theory is overly androcentric kohlbergs theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level  focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends men are likely to move on to the abstract principles and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved consistent with this observation gilligans theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice she developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring critics such as christina hoff sommers however argued that gilligans research is illfounded and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion kohlbergs stages are not culturally neutral as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures although they progress through the stages in the same order individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning rather than to those beliefs another criticism of kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements this often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage typically using more selfinterest driven reasoning ie stage two than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning ie stage four kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning carpendale has argued that kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules this view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives krebs and denton have also attempted to modify kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning social intuitionists such as jonathan haidt for example argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness law human rights or abstract ethical values thus the arguments analyzed by kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than kohlbergs theory suggests continued relevanceedit kohlbergs body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field one example is the defining issues test dit created in  by james rest originally as a pencilandpaper alternative to the moral judgement interview heavily influenced by the sixstage model it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test the likert scale to rate moral dilemmas similar to kohlbergs it also used a large body of kohlbergian theory such as the idea of postconventional thinking in  the dit was revised as the dit the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required such as divinity

objective summarize kohlbergs stages of psychosocial development key points lawrence kohlberg expanded on the earlier work of cognitive theorist jean piaget to explain the moral development of children which he believed follows a series of stages kohlberg defined three levels of moral development preconventional conventional and postconventional each level has two distinct stages during the preconventional level a childs sense of morality is externally controlled children accept and believe the rules of authority figures such as parents and teachers and they judge an action based on its consequences during the conventional level an individuals sense of morality is tied to personal and societal relationships children continue to accept the rules of authority figures but this is now because they believe that this is necessary to ensure positive relationships and societal order during the postconventional level a persons sense of morality is defined in terms of more abstract principles and values people now believe that some laws are unjust and should be changed or eliminated kohlbergs theory has been criticized for its cultural and gendered bias toward white upperclass men and boys it also fails to account for inconsistencies within moral judgments  term morality recognition of the distinction between good and evil or between right and wrong respect for and obedience to the rules of right conduct the mental disposition or characteristic of behaving in a manner intended to produce good results full text lawrence kohlberg expanded on the earlier work of cognitive theorist jean piaget to explain the moral development of children kohlberg believed that moral development like cognitive development follows a series of stages he used the idea of moral dilemmas—stories that present conflicting ideas about two moral values—to teach  to  yearold boys about morality and values the best known moral dilemma created by kohlberg is the heinz dilemma which discusses the idea of obeying the law versus saving a life kohlberg emphasized that it is the way an individual reasons about a dilemma that determines positive moral developmentafter presenting people with various moral dilemmas kohlberg reviewed people’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning according to kohlberg an individual progresses from the capacity for preconventional morality before age  to the capacity for conventional morality early adolescence and toward attaining postconventional morality once piagets idea of formal operational thought is attained which only a few fully achieve each level of morality contains two stages which provide the basis for moral development in various contexts kohlbergs stages of moral development kohlberg identified three levels of moral reasoning preconventional conventional and postconventional each level is associated with increasingly complex stages of moral development level  preconventionalthroughout the preconventional level a childs sense of morality is externally controlled children accept and believe the rules of authority figures such as parents and teachers  a child with preconventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized societys conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bringstage  obedienceandpunishment orientationstage  focuses on the childs desire to obey rules and avoid being punished for example an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished the worse the punishment for the act is the more bad the act is perceived to bestage  instrumental orientationstage  expresses the whats in it for me position in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others only to the point where it might further the individuals own interests as a result concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect but rather a you scratch my back and ill scratch yours mentality an example would be when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore the child asks whats in it for me and the parents offer the child an incentive by giving him an allowance level  conventionalthroughout the conventional level a childs sense of morality is tied to personal and societal relationships children continue to accept the rules of authority figures but this is now due to their belief that this is necessary to ensure positive relationships and societal order adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid during these stages and a rules appropriateness or fairness is seldom questionedstage  good boy nice girl orientationin stage  children want the approval of others and act in ways to avoid disapproval emphasis is placed on good behavior and people being nice to others stage  lawandorder orientationin stage  the child blindly accepts rules and convention because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society rules are seen as being the same for everyone and obeying rules by doing what one is supposed to do is seen as valuable and important moral reasoning in stage four is beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three if one person violates a law perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules most active members of society remain at stage four where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside forcelevel  postconventionalthroughout the postconventional level a persons sense of morality is defined in terms of more abstract principles and values people now believe that some laws are unjust and should be changed or eliminated this level is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society and that individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles postconventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life liberty and justice—and view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms rather than absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question because postconventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions their behavior especially at stage six can sometimes be confused with that of those at the preconventional level some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoningstage  socialcontract orientationin stage  the world is viewed as holding different opinions rights and values such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet the greatest good for the greatest number of people this is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise democratic government is theoretically based on stage five reasoning stage  universalethicalprincipal orientationin stage  moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles generally the chosen principles are abstract rather than concrete and focus on ideas such as equality dignity or respect laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws people choose the ethical principles they want to follow and if they violate those principles they feel guilty in this way the individual acts because it is morally right to do so and not because he or she wants to avoid punishment it is in their best interest it is expected it is legal or it is previously agreed upon although kohlberg insisted that stage six exists he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that levelcritiques of kohlbergs theorykohlberg has been criticized for his assertion that women seem to be deficient in their moral reasoning abilities when compared to men carol gilligan  a research assistant of kohlberg criticized her former mentor’s theory because it was based so narrowly on research using white upperclass men and boys she argued that women are not deficient in their moral reasoning and instead proposed that males and females reason differently girls and women focus more on staying connected and maintaining interpersonal relationships kohlbergs theory has been criticized for emphasizing justice to the exclusion of other values with the result that it may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions similarly critics argue that kohlbergs stages are culturally biased—that the highest stages in particular reflect a westernized ideal of justice based on individualistic thought this is biased against those that live in nonwestern societies that place less emphasis on individualismanother criticism of kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements this often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving or business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a lower developmental stage typically using more selfinterest driven reasoning ie stage two than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning ie stage four critics argue that kohlbergs theory cannot account for such inconsistencies prev

wc crain  theories of development prenticehall pp    chapter seven kohlbergs stages of moral development   biographical introduction an outstanding example of research in the piagetian tradition is the work of lawrence kohlberg kohlberg has focused on moral development and has proposed a stage theory of moral thinking which goes well beyond piagets initial formulations kohlberg who was born in  grew up in bronxville new york and attended the andover academy in massachusetts a private high school for bright and usually wealthy students he did not go immediately to college but instead went to help the israeli cause in which he was made the second engineer on an old freighter carrying refugees from parts of europe to israel after this in  he enrolled at the university of chicago where he scored so high on admission tests that he had to take only a few courses to earn his bachelors degree this he did in one year he stayed on at chicago for graduate work in psychology at first thinking he would become a clinical psychologist however he soon became interested in piaget and began interviewing children and adolescents on moral issues the result was his doctoral dissertation a the first rendition of his new stage theory kohlberg is an informal unassuming man who also is a true scholar he has thought long and deeply about a wide range of issues in both psychology and philosophy and has done much to help others appreciate the wisdom of many of the old psychologists such as rousseau john dewey and james mark baldwin kohlberg has taught at the university of chicago  and since  has been at harvard university piagets stages of moral judgment piaget studied many aspects of moral judgment but most of his findings fit into a twostage theory children younger than  or  years think about moral dilemmas one way older children consider them differently as we have seen younger children regard rules as fixed and absolute they believe that rules are handed down by adults or by god and that one cannot change them the older childs view is more relativistic he or she understands that it is permissible to change rules if everyone agrees rules are not sacred and absolute but are devices which humans use to get along cooperatively at approximately the same time or  yearschildrens moral thinking undergoes other shifts in particular younger children base their moral judgments more on consequences whereas older children base their judgments on intentions when for example the young child hears about one boy who broke  cups trying to help his mother and another boy who broke only one cup trying to steal cookies the young child thinks that the first boy did worse the child primarily considers the amount of damagethe consequenceswhereas the older child is more likely to judge wrongness in terms of the motives underlying the act piaget  p  there are many more details to piagets work on moral judgment but he essentially found a series of changes that occur between the ages of  and  just when the child begins to enter the general stage of formal operations intellectual development however does not stop at this point this is just the beginning of formal operations which continue to develop at least until age  accordingly one might expect thinking about moral issues to continue to develop throughout adolescence kohlberg therefore interviewed both children and adolescents about moral dilemmas and he did find stages that go well beyond piagets he uncovered six stages only the first three of which share many features with piagets stages kohlbergs method kohlbergs a core sample was comprised of  boys from both middle and lowerclass families in chicago they were ages   and  he later added to his sample younger children delinquents and boys and girls from other american cities and from other countries   the basic interview consists of a series of dilemmas such as the following heinz steals the drug in europe a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer there was one drug that the doctors thought might save her it was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered the drug was expensive to make but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make he paid  for the radium and charged  for a small dose of the drug the sick womans husband heinz went to everyone he knew to borrow the money but he could only get together about   which is half of what it cost he told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later but the druggist said no i discovered the drug and im going to make money from it so heinz got desperate and broke into the mans store to steal the drugfor his wife should the husband have done that kohlberg  p  kohlberg is not really interested in whether the subject says yes or no to this dilemma but in the reasoning behind the answer the interviewer wants to know why the subject thinks heinz should or should not have stolen the drug the interview schedule then asks new questions which help one understand the childs reasoning for example children are asked if heinz had a right to steal the drug if he was violating the druggists rights and what sentence the judge should give him once he was caught once again the main concern is with the reasoning behind the answers the interview then goes on to give more dilemmas in order to get a good sampling of a subjects moral thinking once kohlberg had classified the various responses into stages he wanted to know whether his classification was reliable in particular he wanted to know if others would score the protocols in the same way other judges independently scored a sample of responses and he calculated the degree to which all raters agreed this procedure is called interrater reliability kohlberg found these agreements to be high as he has in his subsequent work but whenever investigators use kohlbergs interview they also should check for interrater reliability before scoring the entire sample kohlbergs six stages level  preconventional morality stage  obedience and punishment orientation kohlbergs stage  is similar to piagets first stage of moral thought the child assumes that powerful authorities hand down a fixed set of rules which he or she must unquestioningly obey to the heinz dilemma the child typically says that heinz was wrong to steal the drug because its against the law or its bad to steal as if this were all there were to it when asked to elaborate the child usually responds in terms of the consequences involved explaining that stealing is bad because youll get punished kohlberg b although the vast majority of children at stage  oppose heinzs theft it is still possible for a child to support the action and still employ stage  reasoning for example a child might say heinz can steal it because he asked first and its not like he stole something big he wont get punished see rest  even though the child agrees with heinzs action the reasoning is still stage  the concern is with what authorities permit and punish kohlberg calls stage  thinking preconventional because children do not yet speak as members of society instead they see morality as something external to themselves as that which the big people say they must do stage  individualism and exchange at this stage children recognize that there is not just one right view that is handed down by the authorities different individuals have different viewpoints heinz they might point out might think its right to take the drug the druggist would not since everything is relative each person is free to pursue his or her individual interests one boy said that heinz might steal the drug if he wanted his wife to live but that he doesnt have to if he wants to marry someone younger and betterlooking kohlberg  p  another boy said heinz might steal it because maybe they had children and he might need someone at home to look after them but maybe he shouldnt steal it because they might put him in prison for more years than he could stand colby and kauffman  p  what is right for heinz then is what meets his own selfinterests you might have noticed that children at both stages  and  talk about punishment however they perceive it differently at stage  punishment is tied up in the childs mind with wrongness punishment proves that disobedience is wrong at stage  in contrast punishment is simply a risk that one naturally wants to avoid although stage  respondents sometimes sound amoral they do have some sense of right action this is a notion of fair exchange or fair deals the philosophy is one of returning favorsif you scratch my back ill scratch yours to the heinz story subjects often say that heinz was right to steal the drug because the druggist was unwilling to make a fair deal he was trying to rip heinz off or they might say that he should steal for his wife because she might return the favor some day gibbs et al  p  respondents at stage  are still said to reason at the preconventional level because they speak as isolated individuals rather than as members of society they see individuals exchanging favors but there is still no identification with the values of the family or community level ii conventional morality stage  good interpersonal relationships at this stage childrenwho are by now usually entering their teenssee morality as more than simple deals they believe that people should live up to the expectations of the family and community and behave in good ways good behavior means having good motives and interpersonal feelings such as love empathy trust and concern for others heinz they typically argue was right to steal the drug because he was a good man for wanting to save her and his intentions were good that of saving the life of someone he loves even if heinz doesnt love his wife these subjects often say he should steal the drug because i dont think any husband should sit back and watch his wife die gibbs et al  pp  kohlberg b if heinzs motives were good the druggists were bad the druggist stage  subjects emphasize was selfish greedy and only interested in himself not another life sometimes the respondents become so angry with the druggist that they say that he ought to be put in jail gibbs et al  pp   a typical stage  response is that of don age  it was really the druggists fault he was unfair trying to overcharge and letting someone die heinz loved his wife and wanted to save her i think anyone would i dont think they would put him in jail the judge would look at all sides and see that the druggist was charging too much kohlberg  p  we see that don defines the issue in terms of the actors character traits and motives he talks about the loving husband the unfair druggist and the understanding judge his answer deserves the label conventional morality because it assumes that the attitude expressed would be shared by the entire communityanyone would be right to do what heinz did kohlberg  p  as mentioned earlier there are similarities between kohlbergs first three stages and piagets two stages in both sequences there is a shift from unquestioning obedience to a relativistic outlook and to a concern for good motives for kohlberg however these shifts occur in three stages rather than two stage  maintaining the social order stage  reasoning works best in twoperson relationships with family members or close friends where one can make a real effort to get to know the others feelings and needs and try to help at stage  in contrast the respondent becomes more broadly concerned with society as a whole now the emphasis is on obeying laws respecting authority and performing ones duties so that the social order is maintained in response to the heinz story many subjects say they understand that heinzs motives were good but they cannot condone the theft what would happen if we all started breaking the laws whenever we felt we had a good reason the result would be chaos society couldnt function as one subject explained i dont want to sound like spiro agnew law and order and wave the flag but if everybody did as he wanted to do set up his own beliefs as to right and wrong then i think you would have chaos the only thing i think we have in civilization nowadays is some sort of legal structure which people are sort of bound to follow society needs a centralizing framework gibbs et al  pp  because stage  subjects make moral decisions from the perspective of society as a whole they think from a fullfledged memberofsociety perspective colby and kohlberg  p  you will recall that stage  children also generally oppose stealing because it breaks the law superficially stage  and stage  subjects are giving the same response so we see here why kohlberg insists that we must probe into the reasoning behind the overt response stage  children say its wrong to steal and its against the law but they cannot elaborate any further except to say that stealing can get a person jailed stage  respondents in contrast have a conception of the function of laws for society as a wholea conception which far exceeds the grasp of the younger child level iii postconventional morality stage  social contract and individual rights at stage  people want to keep society functioning however a smoothly functioning society is not necessarily a good one a totalitarian society might be wellorganized but it is hardly the moral ideal at stage  people begin to ask what makes for a good society they begin to think about society in a very theoretical way stepping back from their own society and considering the rights and values that a society ought to uphold they then evaluate existing societies in terms of these prior considerations they are said to take a priortosociety perspective colby and kohlberg  p  stage  respondents basically believe that a good society is best conceived as a social contract into which people freely enter to work toward the benefit of all they recognize that different social groups within a society will have different values but they believe that all rational people would agree on two points first they would all want certain basic rights such as liberty and life to be protected second they would want some democratic procedures for changing unfair law and for improving society in response to the heinz dilemma stage  respondents make it clear that they do not generally favor breaking laws laws are social contracts that we agree to uphold until we can change them by democratic means nevertheless the wifes right to live is a moral right that must be protected thus stage  respondent sometimes defend heinzs theft in strong language it is the husbands duty to save his wife the fact that her life is in danger transcends every other standard you might use to judge his action life is more important than property this young man went on to say that from a moral standpoint heinz should save the life of even a stranger since to be consistent the value of a life means any life when asked if the judge should punish heinz he replied usually the moral and legal standpoints coincide here they conflict the judge should weight the moral standpoint more heavily but preserve the legal law in punishing heinz lightly kohlberg  p  stage  subjects then talk about morality and rights that take some priority over particular laws kohlberg insists however that we do not judge people to be at stage  merely from their verbal labels we need to look at their social perspective and mode of reasoning at stage  too subjects frequently talk about the right to life but for them this right is legitimized by the authority of their social or religious group eg by the bible presumably if their group valued property over life they would too at stage  in contrast people are making more of an independent effort to think out what any society ought to value they often reason for example that property has little meaning without life they are trying to determine logically what a society ought to be like kohlberg  pp  gibbs et al  p  stage  universal principles stage  respondents are working toward a conception of the good society they suggest that we need to a protect certain individual rights and b settle disputes through democratic processes however democratic processes alone do not always result in outcomes that we intuitively sense are just a majority for example may vote for a law that hinders a minority thus kohlberg believes that there must be a higher stagestage which defines the principles by which we achieve justice kohlbergs conception of justice follows that of the philosophers kant and rawls as well as great moral leaders such as gandhi and martin luther king according to these people the principles of justice require us to treat the claims of all parties in an impartial manner respecting the basic dignity of all people as individuals the principles of justice are therefore universal they apply to all thus for example we would not vote for a law that aids some people but hurts others the principles of justice guide us toward decisions based on an equal respect for all in actual practice kohlberg says we can reach just decisions by looking at a situation through one anothers eyes in the heinz dilemma this would mean that all partiesthe druggist heinz and his wifetake the roles of the others to do this in an impartial manner people can assume a veil of ignorance rawls  acting as if they do not know which role they will eventually occupy if the druggist did this even he would recognize that life must take priority over property for he wouldnt want to risk finding himself in the wifes shoes with property valued over life thus they would all agree that the wife must be savedthis would be the fair solution such a solution we must note requires not only impartiality but the principle that everyone is given full and equal respect if the wife were considered of less value than the others a just solution could not be reached until recently kohlberg had been scoring some of his subjects at stage  but he has temporarily stopped doing so for one thing he and other researchers had not been finding subjects who consistently reasoned at this stage also kohlberg has concluded that his interview dilemmas are not useful for distinguishing between stage  and stage  thinking he believes that stage  has a clearer and broader conception of universal principles which include justice as well as individual rights but feels that his interview fails to draw out this broader understanding consequently he has temporarily dropped stage  from his scoring manual calling it a theoretical stage and scoring all postconventional responses as stage  colby and kohlberg  p  theoretically one issue that distinguishes stage  from stage  is civil disobedience stage  would be more hesitant to endorse civil disobedience because of its commitment to the social contract and to changing laws through democratic agreements only when an individual right is clearly at stake does violating the law seem justified at stage  in contrast a commitment to justice makes the rationale for civil disobedience stronger and broader martin luther king for example argued that laws are only valid insofar as they are grounded in justice and that a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws king also recognized of course the general need for laws and democratic processes stages  and  and he was therefore willing to accept the penalities for his actions nevertheless he believed that the higher principle of justice required civil disobedience kohlberg   p  summary at stage  children think of what is right as that which authority says is right doing the right thing is obeying authority and avoiding punishment at stage  children are no longer so impressed by any single authority they see that there are different sides to any issue since everything is relative one is free to pursue ones own interests although it is often useful to make deals and exchange favors with others at stages  and  young people think as members of the conventional society with its values norms and expectations at stage  they emphasize being a good person which basically means having helpful motives toward people close to one at stage  the concern shifts toward obeying laws to maintain society as a whole at stages  and  people are less concerned with maintaining society for it own sake and more concerned with the principles and values that make for a good society at stage  they emphasize basic rights and the democratic processes that give everyone a say and at stage  they define the principles by which agreement will be most just theoretical issues how development occurs kohlberg it is important to remember is a close follower of piaget accordingly kohlbergs theoretical positions including that on developmental change reflect those of his mentor kohlberg eg    ch  says that his stages are not the product of maturation that is the stage structures and sequences do not simply unfold according to a genetic blueprint neither kohlberg maintains are his stages the product of socialization that is socializing agents eg parents and teachers do not directly teach new forms of thinking indeed it is difficult to imagine them systematically teaching each new stage structure in its particular place in the sequence the stages emerge instead from our own thinking about moral problems social experiences do promote development but they do so by stimulating our mental processes as we get into discussions and debates with others we find our views questioned and challenged and are therefore motivated to come up with new more comprehensive positions new stages reflect these broader viewpoints kohlberg et al  we might imagine for example a young man and woman discussing a new law the man says that everyone should obey it like it or not because laws are vital to social organization stage  the woman notes however that some wellorganized societies such as nazi germany were not particularly moral the man therefore sees that some evidence contradicts his view he experiences some cognitive conflict and is motivated to think about the matter more fully perhaps moving a bit toward stage  kohlberg also sometimes speaks of change occurring through roletaking opportunities opportunities to consider others viewpoints eg  as children interact with others they learn how viewpoints differ and how to coordinate them in cooperative activities as they discuss their problems and work out their differences they develop their conceptions of what is fair and just whatever the interactions are specifically like they work best kohlberg says when they are open and democratic the less children feel pressured simply to conform to authority the freer they are to settle their own differences and formulate their own ideas we will discuss kohlbergs efforts to induce developmental change in the section on implications for education the stage concept piaget you will recall proposed that true mental stages meet several criteria they  are qualitatively different ways of thinking  are structured wholes  progress in an invariant sequence  can be characterized as hierarchic integrations and  are crosscultural universals kohlberg has taken these criteria very seriously trying to show how his stages meet them all let us consider these points one at a time  qualitative differences it seems fairly clear that kohlbergs stages are qualitatively different from one another for example stage  responses which focus on obedience to authority sound very different from stage  responses which argue that each person is free to behave as he or she wishes the two stages do not seem to differ along any quantitative dimension they seem qualitatively different  structured wholes by structured wholes kohlberg means that the stages are not just isolated responses but are general patterns of thought that will consistently show up across many different kinds of issues one gets a sense that this is true by reading through his scoring manual one finds the same kinds of thinking reappearing on diverse items for example one item asks why should a promise be kept as on the heinz dilemma children at stage  again speak in terms of obedience to rules whereas those at stage  focus on exchanging favors that are in ones selfinterest eg you never know when youre going to need that person to do something for you similarly as children proceed through the stages they keep giving responses that are similar to those to the heinz dilemma gibbs et al  pp  in addition kohlberg and his coworkers colby et al  have obtained quantitative estimates of the extent to which subjects respond in terms of one particular stage since some subjects might be in transition between stages one does not expect perfect consistency nevertheless kohlberg found that subjects scored at their dominant stage across nine dilemmas about twothirds of the time this seems to be a fair degree of consistency suggesting the stages may reflect general modes of thought  invariant sequence kohlberg believes that his stages unfold in an invariant sequence children always go from stage  to stage  to stage  and so forth they do not skip stages or move through them in mixedup orders not all children necessarily reach the highest stages they might lack intellectual stimulation but to the extent they do go through the stages they proceed in order most of kohlbergs evidence on his stage sequence comes from crosssectional data that is he interviewed different children at various ages to see if the younger ones were at lower stages than the older ones stages  and  are primarily found at the youngest age whereas the higher stages become more prevalent as age increases thus the data support the stage sequence crosssectional findings however are inconclusive in a crosssectional study different children are interviewed at each age so there is no guarantee that any individual child actually moves through the stages in order for example there is no guarantee that a boy who is coded at stage  at age  actually passed through stages  and  in order when he was younger more conclusive evidence must come from longitudinal studies in which the same children are followed over time the first two major longitudinal studies kohlberg and kramer  holstein  began with samples of teenagers and then tested them at threeyear intervals these studies produced ambiguous results in both most subjects either remained at the same stage or moved up one stage but there were also some who might have skipped a stage furthermore these studies indicated that some subjects had regressed and this finding also bothered kohlberg because he believes that movement through his stages should always be forward kohlbergs response to these troublesome findings was to revise his scoring method he had already become uncomfortable with his first b scoring manual believing that it relied too heavily on the content of subjects answers rather than their underlying reasoning and he had made some improvements on it so when these longitudinal findings emerged he decided to develop a much more precise and adequate scoring system and to some extent to revise his definitions of the stages to create the latest scoring manual kohlberg and his coworkers colby et al  worked with seven boys from his original  sample who had been retested every three or four years for  years it was during this work that kohlberg decided to drop stage  kohlberg then examined the hypothesis of invariant sequence for  other boys from his original sample who also had been retested at least twice every three or four years over the year period this time kohlberg and his colleagues colby et al  found no stageskipping and only about  percent of the subjects showed signs of regressing four recent longitudinal studies have obtained similar results although two have found somewhat more regression up to  percent see colby et al  in general then the new longitudinal studies seem to support the invariantsequence hypothesis kohlbergs new longitudinal study has also changed the earlier picture of moral development in other ways stage  had become the dominant stage by age  in the new scoring system however it is more difficult to achieve the higher stagesthe reasoning must be more clearly demonstratedand kohlberg finds that stage  does not become dominant until the boys are in their s and s stage  too only appears in the mids and never becomes very prevalent  hierarchic integration when kohlberg says that his stages are hierarchically integrated he means that people do not lose the insights gained at earlier stages but integrate them into new broader frameworks for example people at stage  can still understand stage  arguments but they now subordinate them to wider considerations they understand that heinz had good motives for stealing but they point out that if we all stole whenever we had a good motive the social structure would break down thus stage  subordinates a concern for motives to a wider concern for the society as a whole the concept of hierarchic integration is very important for kohlberg because it enables him to explain the direction of his stage sequence since he is not a maturationist he cannot simply say that the sequence is wired into the genes so he wants to show how each new stage provides a broader framework for dealing with moral issues stage  as mentioned transcends the limitations of stage  and becomes more broadly concerned with social organization stage  in turn sees the weakness of stage  a wellorganized society is not necessarily a moral one stage  therefore considers the rights and orderly processes that make for a moral society each new stage retains the insights of the prior stage but it recasts them into a broader framework in this sense each new stage is more cognitively adequate than the prior stage if kohlberg is right about the hierarchic nature of his stages we would expect that people would still be able to understand earlier stages but consider them inferior in fact when rest rest et al  rest  presented adolescents with arguments from different stages this is what he found they understood lowerstage reasoning but they disliked it what they preferred was the highest stage they heard whether they fully understood it or not this finding suggests perhaps that they had some intuitive sense of the greater adequacy of the higher stages werner we remember from chapter  described hierarchic integration as a process that occurs alongside differentiation and kohlberg believes his stages represent increasingly differentiated structures as well kohlberg points out that the stage  value on life for example has become differentiated from other considerations stage  respondents say that we ought to value life for its own sake regardless of its value to authorities stage  its usefulness to oneself stage  the affection it arouses in us stage  or its value within a particular social order stage  stage  subjects have abstracted this value from other considerations and now treat it as a purely moral ideal their thinking kohlberg says is becoming like that of the moral philosophers in the kantian tradition  p   universal sequence kohlberg like all stage theorists maintains that his stage sequence is universal it is the same in all cultures at first glance this proposal might be surprising dont different cultures socialize their children differently teaching them very different moral beliefs kohlbergs response is that different cultures do teach different beliefs but that his stages refer not to specific beliefs but to underlying modes of reasoning kohlberg and gilligan   for example one culture might discourage physical fighting while another encourages it more as a result children will have different beliefs about fighting but they will still reason about it in the same way at the same stage at stage  for example one child might say that it is wrong to fight when insulted because you will get punished for it while another says that it is all right to fight you wont get punished the beliefs differ but both children reason about them in the same underlying way in terms of the physical consequences punishment they do so because this is what they can cognitively grasp later on the first child might argue that fighting is bad because if everyone fought all the time there would be anarchy while the second child argues that people must defend their honor because if they dont everyone will be insulting everyone and the whole society will break down once again the specific beliefs differ reflecting different cultural teachings but the underlying reasoning is the samein this case it is stage  where people can consider something as abstract as the social order children regardless of their beliefs will always move to stage  thinking some time after stage  thinking because it is cognitively so much more sophisticated kohlberg then proposes that his stage sequence will be the same in all cultures for each stage is conceptually more advanced than the next he and other researchers have given his interview to children and adults in a variety of cultures including mexico taiwan turkey israel the yucatan kenya the bahamas and india most of the studies have been cross sectional but a few have been longitudinal thus far the studies have supported kohlbergs stage sequence to the extent that children move through the stages they appear to move in order edwards  at the same time people in different cultures seem to move through the sequence at different rates and to reach different endpoints in the united states most urban middleclass adults reach stage  with a small percentage using some stage  reasoning in urban areas of other countries the picture is fairly similar in the isolated villages and tribal communities of many countries however it is rare to find any adult beyond stage  edwards  kohlberg nisan and kohlberg  suggests that one can understand these findings in terms of piagetian theory cultural factors in this theory do not directly shape the childs moral thought but they do stimulate thinking social experiences can challenge childrens ideas motivating them to come up with new ones in traditional villages however there may be little to challenge a stage  morality the norms of care and empathy work very well in governing the facetoface interactions of the group thus there is little to stimulate thinking beyond this stage when in contrast young people leave the village and go off to the city they witness the breakdown of interpersonal ties they see that group norms of care and empathy have little impact on the impersonal interactions of city life and they see the need for a formal legal structure to ensure moral conduct they begin to think in terms of stage  morality furthermore as keniston  notes if young people attend the universities they may take classes in which the teachers deliberately question the unexamined assumptions of their childhoods and adolescences thus they are stimulated to think about moral matters in new ways moral thought and moral behavior kohlbergs scale has to do with moral thinking not moral action as everyone knows people who can talk at a high moral level may not behave accordingly consequently we would not expect perfect correlations between moral judgment and moral action still kohlberg thinks that there should be some relationship as a general hypothesis he proposes that moral behavior is more consistent predictable and responsible at the higher stages kohlberg et al  because the stages themselves increasingly employ more stable and general standards for example whereas stage  bases decisions on others feelings which can vary stage  refers to set rules and laws thus we can expect that moral behavior too will become more consistent as people move up the sequence generally speaking there is some research support for this hypothesis eg with respect to cheating but the evidence is not clearcut blasi  brown and herrnstein  some research has focused on the relationships between particular stages and specific kinds of behavior for example one might expect that juvenile delinquents or criminals would typically reason at stages  or  viewing morality as something imposed from without stage  or as a matter of selfinterest stage  rather than identifying with societys conventional expectations stages  and  again some research supports this hypothesis but there also are some ambiguous results blasi  several studies have examined the relationship between postconventional thinking and student protest in a landmark study haan et al  examined the moral reasoning of those who participated in the berkeley free speech movement in  haan found that their thinking was more strongly postconventional than that of a matched sample of nonparticipants but this f inding was not replicated for some other protests apparently because moral principles were not at stake keniston  pp   blasi  after reviewing  studies concludes that overall there is a relationship between moral thought and action but he suggests that we need to introduce other variables to clarify this relationship one variable may simply be the extent to which individuals themselves feel the need to maintain consistency between their moral thoughts and actions blasi  kohlberg and candee  moral thought and other forms of cognition kohlberg has also tried to relate his moral stages to other forms of cognition he has first analyzed his stages in terms of their underlying cognitive structures and has then looked for parallels in purely logical and social thought for this purpose he has analyzed his own stages in terms of implicit roletaking capacities capacities to consider others viewpoints kohlberg  see also selman  and rest  at first at stage  children hardly seem to recognize that viewpoints differ they assume that there is only one right view that of authorities at stage  in contrast they recognize that people have different interests and viewpoints they seem to be overcoming egocentrism they see that perspectives are relative to the individual  they also begin to consider how individuals might coordinate their interests in terms of mutually beneficial deals at stage  people conceptualize roletaking as a deeper more empathic process one becomes concerned with the others feelings stage  in turn has a broader societywide conception of how people coordinate their roles through the legal system stages  and  finally take a more idealized look at how people might coordinate their interests stage  emphasizes democratic processes and stage  considers how all parties take one anothers perspectives according to the principles of justice the moral stages then reflect expanded insights into how perspectives differ and might be coordinated as such the moral stages might be related to stages of logical and social thought which contain similar insights so far the empirical evidence suggests that advances in moral thinking may rest upon prior achievements in these other realms kohlberg  kuhn et al  for example children seem to advance to stage  overcoming their egocentrism in the moral sphere only after they have made equivalent progress in their logical and social thought if this pattern is correct we can expect to find many individuals who are logical and even socially insightful but still underdeveloped in their moral judgment implications for education kohlberg would like to see people advance to the highest possible stage of moral thought the best possible society would contain individuals who not only understand the need for social order stage  but can entertain visions of universal principles such as justice and liberty stage  kohlberg  how then can one promote moral development turiel  found that when children listened to adults moral judgments the resulting change was slight this is what kohlberg might have expected for he believes that if children are to reorganize their thinking they must be more active accordingly kohlberg encouraged another student moshe blatt to lead discussion groups in which children had a chance to grapple actively with moral issues blatt and kohlberg  blatt presented moral dilemmas which engaged the classes in a good deal of heated debate he tried to leave much of the discussion to the children themselves stepping in only to summarize clarify and sometimes present a view himself p  he encouraged arguments that were one stage above those of most of the class in essence he tried to implement one of kohlbergs main ideas on how children move through the stages they do so by encountering views which challenge their thinking and stimulate them to formulate better arguments kohlberg et al  blatt began a typical discussion by telling a story about a man named mr jones who had a seriously injured son and wanted to rush him to the hospital mr jones had no car so he approached a stranger told him about the situation and asked to borrow his car the stranger however refused saying he had an important appointment to keep so mr jones took the car by force blatt then asked whether mr jones should have done that in the discussion that followed one child student b felt that mr jones had a good cause for taking the car and also believed that the stranger could be charged with murder if the son died student c pointed out that the stranger violated no law student b still felt that the strangers behavior was somehow wrong even though he now realized that it was not legally wrong thus student b was in a kind of conflict he had a sense of the wrongness of the strangers behavior but he could not articulate this sense in terms that would meet the objection he was challenged to think about the problem more deeply in the end blatt gave him the answer the strangers behavior blatt said was not legally wrong but morally wrongwrong according to gods laws this was a sunday school class at this point blatt was an authority teaching the correct view in so doing he might have robbed student b of the chance to formulate spontaneously his own position he might have done better to ask a question or to simply clarify the students conflict eg so its not legally wrong but you still have a sense that its somehow wrong   in any case it seems clear that part of this discussion was valuable for this student since he himself struggled to formulate a distinction that could handle the objection he could fully appreciate and assimilate a new view that he was looking for the kohlbergblatt method of inducing cognitive conflict exemplifies piagets equilibration model the child takes one view becomes confused by discrepant information and then resolves the confusion by forming a more advanced and comprehensive position the method is also the dialectic process of socratic teaching the students give a view the teacher asks questions which get them to see the inadequacies of their views and they are then motivated to formulate better positions in blatts first experiment the students sixth graders participated in  weekly discussion groups blatt found that over half the students moved up one full stage after the  weeks blatt and others have tried to replicate these findings sometimes using other age groups and lengthier series of classes as often happens with replications the results have not been quite so successful upward changes have been smallerusually a third of a stage or less still it generally seems that socratic classroom discussions held over several months can produce changes that while small are significantly greater than those found in control groups who do not receive these experiences rest  one of blatts supplementary findings was that those students who reported that they were most interested in the discussions made the greatest amount of change this finding is in keeping with piagetian theory children develop not because they are shaped through external reinforcements but because their curiosity is aroused they become interested in information that does not quite fit into their existing cognitive structures and are thereby motivated to revise their thinking another kohlberg studentm berkowitz is examining actual dialogues to see if those who become most challenged and involved in the tensions of moral debate are also those who move forward although kohlberg remains committed to the cognitiveconflict model of change he has also become interested in other strategies one is the just community approach here the focus is not the individuals but groups for example kohlberg and some of his colleagues power and reimer  set up a special democratic high school group and actively encouraged the students to think of themselves as a community initially little community feeling was present the groups dominant orientation was stage  it treated problems such as stealing as purely individual matters if a boy had something stolen it was too bad for him after a year however the group norms advanced to stage  the students now considered stealing to be a community issue that reflected on the degree of trust and care in the group it will be interesting to see if the just community approach can promote further advances in moral thinking in the meantime this approach has aroused some uneasiness among some of kohlbergs associates in particular reimer et al  have wondered whether kohlberg by explicitly encouraging the students to think of themselves as a community is not practicing a form of indoctrination reimer says that he has talked to kohlberg about this and he has come away convinced that kohlberg is committed to democratic groups in which students are encouraged to think critically to discuss assumptions and when they feel it is necessary to challenge the teachers suggestions p  thus moral development remains a product of the students own thinking evaluation kohlberg a follower of piaget has offered a new more detailed stage sequence for moral thinking whereas piaget basically found two stages of moral thinking the second of which emerges in early adolescence kohlberg has uncovered additional stages which develop well into adolescence and adulthood he has suggested that some people even reach a postconventional level of moral thinking where they no longer accept their own society as given but think reflectively and autonomously about what a good society should be the suggestion of a postconventional morality is unusual in the social sciences perhaps it took a cognitive developmentalist list to suggest such a thing for whereas most social scientists have been impressed by the ways in which societies mold and shape childrens thinking cognitivedevelopmentalists are more impressed by the capacities for independent thought if children engage in enough independent thinking kohlberg suggests they will eventually begin to formulate conceptions of rights values and principles by which they evaluate existing social arrangements perhaps some will even advance to the kinds of thinking that characterize some of the great moral leaders and philosophers who have at times advocated civil disobedience in the name of universal ethical principles kohlbergs theory has provoked a good deal of criticism not everyone first of all is enthusiastic about the concept of a postconventional morality hogan   for example feels that it is dangerous for people to place their own principles above society and the law it may be that many psychologists react to kohlberg in a similar way and that this reaction underlies many of the debates over the scientific merits of his research others have argued that kohlbergs stages are culturally biased simpson  for example says that kohlberg has developed a stage model based on the western philosophical tradition and has then applied this model to nonwestern cultures without considering the extent to which they have different moral outlooks this criticism may have merit one wonders how well kohlbergs stages apply to the great eastern philosophies one also wonders if his stages do justice to moral development in many traditional village cultures researchers find that villagers stop at stage  but perhaps they continue to develop moralities in directions that kohlbergs stages fail to capture another criticism is that kohlbergs theory is sexbiased a view that has been thoughtfully expressed by one of kohlbergs associates and coauthors carol gilligan  gilligan observes that kohlbergs stages were derived exclusively from interviews with males and she charges that the stages reflect a decidedly male orientation for males advanced moral thought revolves around rules rights and abstract principles the ideal is formal justice in which all parties evaluate one anothers claims in an impartial manner this conception of morality gilligan argues fails to capture the distinctly female voice on moral matters for women gilligan says morality centers not on rights and rules but on interpersonal relationships and the ethics of compassion and care the ideal is not impersonal justice but more affiliative ways of living womens morality in addition is more contextualized it is tied to real ongoing relationships rather than abstract solutions to hypothetical dilemmas because of these sex differences gilligan says men and women frequently score at different stages on kohlbergs scale women typically score at stage  with its focus on interpersonal feelings whereas men more commonly score at stages  and  which reflect more abstract conceptions of social organization thus women score lower than men if however kohlbergs scale were more sensitive to womens distinctly interpersonal orientations it would show that women also continue to develop their thinking beyond stage  gilligan has made an initial effort to trace womens moral development since she believes that womens conceptions of care and affiliation are embedded in reallife situations she has interviewed women facing a personal crisisthe decision to have an abortion through these interviews gilligan has tried to show that women move from a conventional to a postconventional mode of thinking that is they no longer consider their responsibilities in terms of what is conventionally expected of them but in terms of their own insights into the ethics of care and responsibility not everyone agrees with gilligans critique rest  in particular argues that gilligan has exaggerated the extent of the sex differences found on kohlbergs scale an evaluation of this question however must await closer reviews of the literature in the meantime gilligan has raised an interesting theoretical possibility like werner she is suggesting that development may proceed along more than one line one line of moral thought focuses on logic justice and social organization the other on interpersonal relationships if this is so there is the further possibility that these two lines at some point become integrated within each sex that is each sex might become more responsive to the dominant orientation of the other perhaps as gilligan briefly suggests  ch  this integration is a major task of the adult years for further thoughts in this vein see chapter  on jungs theory of adult development there are other criticisms of kohlbergs work many of these have to do with empirical matters such as the problem of invariant sequence the prevalence of regression and the relationships between thought and action since i have mentioned these earlier i would like to conclude with a more general question kohlberg writes in a forceful manner and he promotes stage  as if it provides the decisionmaking tools we need for the toughest ethical dilemmas however there may be issues that the principles of justice frequently fail to resolve one such issue is abortion stage  would ask us to consider the physical life of the fetus as well as all the parties right to fulfilling lives but does stage  routinely lead to decisions that we feel are right kohlbergs students reimer et al  pp   discuss a stage  approach to a hypothetical abortion decision without reaching much of a conclusion the decision they say will have to vary with the situation stage  of course is not intended to provide a set of answersit is a mode of decisionmaking still kohlberg sometimes seems to skim over the incredible difficulty that some ethical problems presenta difficulty that is more directly expressed in the writing of kant  nevertheless whatever criticisms and questions we might have there is no doubt that kohlbergs accomplishment is great he has not just expanded on piagets stages of moral judgment but has done so in an inspiring way he has studied the development of moral reasoning as it might work its way toward the thinking of the great moral philosophers so although few people may ever begin to think about moral issues like socrates kant or martin luther king kohlberg has nonetheless provided us with a challenging vision of what development might be
