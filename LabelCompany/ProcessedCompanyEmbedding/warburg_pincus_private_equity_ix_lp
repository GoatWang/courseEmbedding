corporation a materials science company that develops and markets patented polymer products for food agriculture personal care and drug delivery applications today announced that it has acquired lifecore biomedical inc from warburg pincus private equity ix lp warburg pincus when acquired by warburg pincus in march  lifecore was comprised of two divisions the dental division and the hyaluronan division the dental division was merged into a warburg pincus portfolio company the hyaluronan division now lifecore based in chaska mn is a leading supplier of premium hyaluronanbased biomaterials for the medical and veterinary markets lifecore hyaluronan biopolymers are used in a wide and evergrowing range of therapeutic treatments including cataract surgery degenerative joint disease spinal defect filling medical device coatings cosmetic soft tissue enhancement and equine osteoarthritis as well as in numerous research initiatives the acquisition of lifecore significantly advances our stated strategy to acquire a company that expands our capabilities in materials science specifically in the area of biomaterials said gary steele chairman and ceo of landec hyaluronic acid ha is naturally present in the skin cartilage and fluid of humans and provides lubricating connective and shock absorbing functions in both joints and soft tissue demand for premium fermented hyaluronan in biomaterial applications is growing we view lifecores hyaluronan biopolymers as a technology platform that can provide unique ha product innovations as well as new products from potential synergies with landecs existing intelimerr polymers lifecores president and ceo dennis j allingham added we welcome the strategic acquisition of lifecore by landec which strengthens our commitment to the development of technically advanced hyaluronanbased specialty medical products that can offer treatment advantages and compatibility within the human body we are excited about the potential opportunities to apply landecs knowledge of polymer technology to our new product concepts as a means to expand our product offerings bring greater value to our customers and attract marketleading partners under the agreement landec acquired the stock of lifecore for  million in cash and assumed debt of approximately  million in addition the agreement includes a future cash earnout potential for warburg pincus of up to  million based on lifecore achieving certain financial targets during calendar years  and  in conjunction with the acquisition landec secured bank financing of  million the financing has a five year term with a fixed interest rate of approximately  after the acquisition landecs cash and marketable securities balance will be approximately  million as a result of this transaction landec will record approximately  million of acquisition related expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  for landecs fiscal year  which begins may   lifecores revenues are projected to be in the range of  million to  million before the impact on cost of sales from having to stepup inventory to fair market value and from any incentive stock compensation lifecore is expected to realize an average gross margin of approximately  and an ebitda margin of approximately  generating ebitda in the range of  million to  million under accounting guidance for business combinations inventory must be recorded at its fair market value and thus the value of finished goods inventory and in some instances work in process inventory is steppedup to fair market value the increase in the recorded value of the inventory results in lower margins upon the sale of the specific steppedup inventory until that inventory is completely sold landec is currently in the process of valuing the finished goods inventory and will know the amount of the stepup within the next  days the acquisition of lifecore is consistent with our stated strategy to acquire a company that expands our capabilities in materials science and advances three additional stated objectives which are  to invest in areas of growth outside of our food technology business  to invest in areas of biomaterials that have potential synergies with landecs intelimer polymers and  to make an acquisition that is accretive now and going forward lifecore represents an important investment for landecs future innovation in the area of biomaterials landecs focus on profitable growth and positive cash generation allows us to selectively pursue and take advantage of growth opportunities that meet or exceed our criteria for achieving attractive returns on our investment stated steele about lifecore biomedical lifecore biomedical based in chaska mn develops manufactures and markets hyaluronanbased biomaterials in the form of compounds and several finished products for biomedical applications targeting both joints and soft tissue in ophthalmic orthopedic and veterinary markets the compounds used

average to spend their investors money in global funds of similar size private equity investors which usually include public pension funds insurance firms and sovereign wealth funds prefer their money to be deployed quickly assuming its invested wisely the sources asked not to be identified because the fundraising process is confidential warburg pincus declined to comment warburg differs from most of its rivals because in addition to investing in leveraged buyouts which use debt to boost returns in acquired companies it also makes venture capital and growth equity investments these investments requiring little or no debt help it deploy capital when leveraged buyouts are too expensive leveraged buyouts have become pricier in recent years partly because of the strong equity and debt markets but also because of competition from buyout firms to spend the capital they have raised undeployed capital reached an industry record of  trillion in  according to market research firm preqin warburg pincus focuses more on venture capital and growth equity deals which are typically smaller and less expensive because they tend to be less visible and attract fewer rivals no other fund of warburgs size combines leveraged buyouts with venture capital investing the strategy requires warburg to do more deals to put its funds to work warburg pincus private equity xi the  billion fund that warburg finished raising in  has carried out more than  deals to date with the average equity commitment at between  million and  million according to the sources by comparison the average deal of private

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
