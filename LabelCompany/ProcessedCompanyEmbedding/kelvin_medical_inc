engages in the development and sale of medical devices the company was founded to develop the product called thermnice thermnice is a medical device designed to easily and conveniently provide contrast therapy to the human body  what is contrast therapy contrast therapy is the application of hot and cold packs on the skin of an injured area it decreases pain increases circulation and speeds healing  contrast therapy is most often used on sports injuries but it is also helpful for chronic or repetitive injuries especially those in the subacute stages of healing contrast therapy generally consists of applying ice then heat then ice again in a  ratio  the ratio means that you will apply the heat for twice as long as you’ve applied the ice  you always want to end with an ice application how does it work ice therapy flushes all the blood out of an area along with cellular debris which speeds healing  it also reduces pain as it numbs the area heat application brings blood to the area which has a twofold effect  first it by definition increases circulation and fills all the blood vessels in the area down to the tiniest capillaries with fresh blood this reduces pain releases tension and reduces muscle cramping  second it brings fresh nutrients to the area which speeds up the healing process  what is thermnice thermnice is a product conveniently straps to the body provides

that it meets peoples needs  why is thermnice important a few years ago the magnitude of minor sprains strains and contusions that occur both in sports related and routine daily living activities came to our attention there are very large numbers of these injuries and many require some form of intervention a portion of these are so minor that a cold pack is the best treatment while others necessitate more significant treatment tennis elbow for example requires long term treatment of hot and cold therapy the center for disease control cdc indicated that in  there were  sprains strains and contusions reported of these injuries almost  occurred in the arm or leg and  were in the torso or spine and back it turns out that leg arm and back injuries are commonplace given today’s lifestyle current health recommendations encourage us to exercise and keep fit however many of us remain out of shape accidents will occur to both the fit and the unfit although perhaps at different rates bruises and sprains are ordinary incidents and not unexpected almost every ushousehold has an ice pack and a hot water bottle however neither of these items are versatile enough to be readily mobile and both require time out from personal activities in order to use the reality of these statistics creates a vast opening for new treatment options to address these commonplace injuries thermnice provides a modern approach to sprains and strains as well as improvements to the treatment options currently available  copyright  kelvin medical inc products – kelvin medical inc home
