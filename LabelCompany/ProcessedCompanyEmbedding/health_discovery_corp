vector machine support vector machine svm recursive feature elimination rfe fractal genomic modeling fgm independant validations since their introduction in  support vector machines marked a breakthrough in the theory of learning systems  rooted in the statistical learning theory developed by vladimir vapnik support vector machines quickly gained attention from the pattern recognition community due to its theoretical and computational merits statistical learning theory the backbone of support vector machines provides a new framework for modeling learning algorithms merges the fields of machine learning and statistics and inspires algorithms that overcome all of the above difficulties a new generation of learning algorithms  or equivalently of statistical methods  has recently been developed based on this theory health discovery corporations svm technology outperforms even advanced statistical modeling methodologies such as neural networks  neural networks suffer from a limited ability to handle data and can only analyze the data from two or three dimensions  support vector machines however are able to process infinite amounts of data and to analyze the data to find separations and delineations high dimensionality the company’s svm technology is commonly considered within the context of artificial intelligence this is a branch of computer science concerned with giving computers the ability to perform functions normally associated with human intelligence such as reasoning and optimization through experience machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables the development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn pattern recognition is machine learning with a wide spectrum of applications including medical diagnosis bioinformatics classifying dna sequences detecting credit card fraud stock market analysis object recognition in computer vision and robot locomotion pattern recognition in onedimensional space pattern recognition in twodimensional space pattern recognition in threedimensional space data separations can become simpler in higher dimensional space while separable only by a highly nonlinear function in d a simple plane provides this d separation in our example   health discovery corporation    health discovery corporation stock quote home  overview  technology  investor

communications pursuant to rule e—c under the exchange act             item  other information   on january   health discovery corporation the “company” or “hdc” notified neogenomics laboratories inc “neogenomics” of hdc’s election to terminate all licenses that are subject to the master license agreement the “mla” dated january   between the company and neogenomics the mla was filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” on january   as an exhibit to a current report on form k   the mla provides for termination of the licenses by hdc upon a material breach by neogenomics and hdc is hereby exercising those rights the company believes among other things that neogenomics failed to use best efforts as defined in section  of the mla during the development term of the mla the termination by hdc does not trigger any early termination penalties for hdc   accordingly neogenomics has been directed to cease and desist all uses of the licensed products additionally pursuant to the mla upon termination neogenomics may not use any product or service based upon the licensed technology without infringing upon hdc’s technology   furthermore neogenomics has been notified that any patents issued or pending owned by either hdc or neogenomics which are based in whole or in part on hdc’s patents or technology may not be used by neogenomics in the absence of a license authorized by hdc   since the effective date of the mla hdc has worked diligently and was fully supportive to what hdc was led to believe would be a successful commercial launch of licensed products by neogenomics neogenomics has failed to cure several defaults of their obligations required per the mla including but not limited to reporting related to licensed uses along with their corresponding payments despite hdc’s numerous prior requests regarding neogenomics’ usage of hdc’s technology and neogenomics failure to provide the usage reports hdc has now demanded a full report and compensation for all uses of hdc’s technology as called for in the mla hdc will pursue all compensation due from neogenomics to the full extent of the law additionally hdc is evaluating potential damages related to the failure of neogenomics to perform its obligations per the mla   a copy of the termination notice is attached hereto as exhibit    the foregoing description of the termination notice does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such document a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this current report on form k   item  financial statements and exhibits a not applicable b not applicable c not applicable d exhibits      termination notice dated january   sent from health discovery corporation to neogenomics laboratories inc   signatures   pursuant to the requirements of the securities exchange act of  the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized     health discovery corporation         dated  january   by s kevin kowbel       kevin kowbel chairman  chief executive officer             exhibit    click to enlarge health discovery corporation  dunwoody club drive suite  atlanta georgia        january   via email   douglas m vanoort chairman and chief executive officer neogenomics laboratories inc  commonwealth drive suite  fort myers florida    mr vanoort   health discovery corporation “hdc” has previously requested a complete statement of any and all uses of any kind of hdc technology by neogenomics laboratories inc “neo” as required by the master license agreement “mla” dated january   the mla includes a provision section  for neo to provide such reporting on a timely and complete basis to date neo has ignored this requirement and several requests by hdc for the required information as called for in the mla hdc repeats its demand for such a statement and accounting for any and all uses of hdc technology by neo within  business days   in the absence of neo providing this information hdc has prepared an invoice which is enclosed this invoice is based on hdc’s good faith analysis of information it believes to be accurate for amounts currently owed to hdc as compensation for the revenue received for the use of hdc’s technology by neo to date hdc hereby demands immediate payment of  the invoice is based on amounts owed as far back as april  so these amounts owed are well beyond past due additionally as further details are discovered hdc reserves the right to increase the amount of this invoice   it should also be noted that on january   hdc requested information pertaining to neo’s assertion that neo had a first commercial use “commercial use” of a flow cytometry interpretation system based product or service because neo did not provide the information requested hdc hereby rejects neo’s claim of commercial use   we remind you of hdc’s notice to neo dated october   in which hdc elected its right to cancel all licenses that are the subject of the mla hdc subsequently delayed the effectiveness of the october   letter the purpose of the delay was to allow for a discussion between the parties to find alternative remedies for hdc after the passage of over one hundred days and one formal meeting in new york without any resolution hdc’s board has determined that the best interest of its shareholders is to take the following action therefore you are advised that hdc hereby declares its letter of october   effective immediately accordingly hdc exercises its right pursuant to section  in the agreement to terminate all of the licenses that are the subject of the mla           as stated in our october   letter the principal basis for the termination of the licenses is neo’s failure to perform its obligations as set forth in section  specifically neo agreed to use its best efforts to develop the initial licensed products and have a first commercial use of such licensed products within the development term the development term commenced on january   and ended on january   since the development term ended on january   there is no cure period   the facts cited in the fourth paragraph of the october   letter remain accurate but there have been subsequent developments that are very concerning to hdc   during an october   earnings conference call with investors and investment analysts mr steve jones made detrimental and revealing statements concerning hdc mr jones stated that neo intends to commercialize a prostate test but that neo alleges the test is not based on hdc technology hdc asserts that this statement is untrue in fact neo’s publications related to the test neolab prostate clearly indicate the use of hdc’s knowhow and technology including but not limited to the four genes that are a part of a pending patent with the united states patent and trademark office these same genes are part of a patent issued in europe which does not expire until december  therefore neo’s statements on october   are untrue and possibly deceptive in addition the statement was clearly damaging to hdc and its shareholders the statement was injurious to the public reputation of hdc and its technology   equally concerning however is that the statement is an admission by neo that it not only confirms it failed to fulfill its best efforts obligation to hdc but that neo has actually been undertaking to surreptitiously develop a product which would directly compete with an hdc based product for some currently unknown period of time through numerous public statements over the years neo led hdc and its shareholders to believe that it was using its best efforts to develop and commercialize a prostate test based upon hdc technology as it had agreed to do in fact it was doing no such thing and it was secretly developing a competitive product mr vanoort also noted this unsettling development during a conference call with hdc on october   you stated that neo was not using hdc technology in its prostate test and that neo therefore had no obligation to pay any milestone and royalties to hdc you admitted that hdc had “pointed us in the right direction” and that neo would consider paying a greatly reduced compensation on the condition that hdc agree to accept a renegotiation of the mla on terms and conditions materially adverse to hdc   it is clear that hdc and its shareholders have been damaged by the actions inactions and false statements made by neo hdc is evaluating such damages and intends to seek professional advice as to the nature and extent of such damages and appropriate actions that hdc should take in order to protect its shareholders   to date hdc’s analysis of such damages includes but is not limited to the following    damages sustained as a result of neo’s failure to use its best efforts to develop and commercialize hdc technology in the agreed upon time frame    neo’s failure as above precluded hdc from the opportunity to contract with other parties to develop and commercialize hdc’s technology thereby foregoing substantial value that would have accrued from timely development of a product or service based on hdc technology    damage to hdc’s reputation for its technology which may impair hdcs ability to find other development partners for its technology    damage sustained by hdc’s past and current shareholders           hdc hereby demands that neo immediately cease and desist from the use of any hdc technology in any way including but not limited to any use or sale of any product  service or combination product  service which is based on or uses any hdc technology or intellectual property   finally please be notified that any patents that neo has or will apply for as well as any patents that are issued which are based in whole or in part on hdc’s patents may not be used in the absence of a license agreement between neo and hdc   if you have any questions please call either of the hdc representatives listed in the january   letter to neo   sincerely   s board of directors health discovery corporation   enclosure   cc mr daniel nunn nelson mullins riley  scarborough llp         recursive feature elimination
