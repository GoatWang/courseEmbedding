for approximately  percent of the value of the cattle the day cattle are delivered to national beefs processing plants the following week a check for the balance is issued based on final quality and yield grades of the cattle where are the national beefs processing plants locatednational beef has two beef processing plants located in liberal and dodge city ks uspb producers deliver cattle to all plantssee the following for directionsliberal ksdodge city ks who makes up us premium beefproducers from all segments of the us beef industry including purebred and commercial cowcalf producers backgrounders farmerfeeders and commercial cattle feeders are unitholders in us premium beef having all segments of the industry participate enables uspb to more efficiently produce safe consistently high quality beef products consumers want how does us premium beef add value to a producers cattleus premium beef works with its producers to improve production efficiencies as well as carcass quality to optimize performance from their beef enterprises the result is higher more consistent quality beef delivered to national beefs plants that enables nbp to grow its valueadded branded product lines including black canyon®premium reserve certified premium beef™ black canyon® angus beef naturesource™ natural beef certified angus beef® prime and certified hereford beef® in addition to selling their cattle on uspbs high quality grid unitholders receive cash distributions from the valueadded earnings of nbp how is us premium beef different from beef alliancesthe primary difference between us premium beef and other marketing alliances in the beef industry today is that uspb is an owner of the company that processes and markets its producers product all the way to retail and in some cases to consumers this uniquetothebeef industry producerowned beef company assures its unitholders that they receive all the value added to the beef they produce through the further processed portion of the industryin other words uspb unitholders have made a financial investment to own their product through valueadded processing in return they are able to sell their cattle on an individual animal value basis and also benefit financially from the value national beef adds after their cattle are delivered to the processing plants the financial commitment uspb unitholders make helps encourage them to produce better quality beef in addition these producers also have pride of ownership in the branded products national beef produces from the cattle they delivertoday no other largescale beef program in the united states more directly ties beef producers to consumers to assure production of safe consistent high quality beef products uspb enables producers to take ownership and responsibility for our products in the consumer marketplace what kind of cattle work well on the uspb gridto generate more returns than selling on the live cash market a pen of cattle needs to excel in four areas one could use the analogy of a fourcylinder engine if you will there are four different cylinders that a pen of cattle must fire on to do wellfirst is total quality gradethis includes prime certified angus beef® and black canyon® premium reserve  these cattle generate the largest premiums however there are no discounts if your pen of cattle does not produce any choice or better is also part of the total quality grade and the payment or premium is relative to the seasonality of the choiceselect spread cattle that produce  choice or better will receive a quality grade premium however the premium will fluctuate with the market when the choiceselect spread is high the fuel premium coming into this cylinder is a little richersecond is yield or dressing percent whenever you make a comparison of a carcassbased pricing system uspb to the live cash market yield will affect that comparison cattle that yield high have a lighter live weight relative to their hot carcass weight therefore if your cattle yield higher than plant average chances are that you will benefit by simply selling carcass weight rather than live weight on the other hand when cattle weigh up live with extra feed gut fill or mud their live weight is inflated this in turn will hurt the comparison of any carcassbased pricing system when comparing to selling live weight because you could have sold extra weight on a live basiscattle that were placed on feed at a lighter weight and have more days on feed tend to yield higher than shortfed cattle also cattle of exotic or continental breeding tend to have a higher dressing percent than most straightbred english or british breeds when compared at similar placement weights and days on feed if you already market your cattle on a carcass basis ie flat meat bid gradeandyield or a grid then yield essentially doesnt matter assuming that your carcasses will weigh the same at national beef as they would at the plant you are currently delivering tothird is total yield grade this is primarily avoiding yield grade s and s fatter lighter muscled cattle which are discounted there are premiums available for producing more yg s and s than plant average however there is no discount for being below plant average for yg s or s there is also a discount of cwt for weight that is above plant average for yg s in our analogy producing more yg s than average is like missing a valve ring and causing this cylinder to misfirefourth is outweight cattle obviously if you can avoid light and especially heavyweight discounts premiums will tend to be higher the total discount for a carcass that is one pound too heavy is   x cwt thats a lot of fuel to waste outweight cattle can often be minimized by adjusting the placement weight of the cattle cattle placed at a weight of less than  or even  pounds tend to produce fewer heavyweights and also yield well keep in mind the type and breed of cattle you are feeding and their potential for growth to avoid placing them on feed at a weight that will produce heavyweight carcassesyour total net premium per head versus cash will be a net sum of all four cylinders if one isnt firing then it will definitely slow down the engine however the power total premium can come from only one or two cylinders even if the others are a little below average at the same time you can make consistent premiums with cattle that are only slightly above average in all areas i have some cattle i think will work well on your grid what exactly do i have to do to sell them to uspbfollowing is a stepbystep procedure for marketing cattle through us premium beef under a lease agreement with an existing unitholder it includes all events that normally take place and all actions that you the owner of the cattle must take to deliver cattlebecome an associate of us premium beef the cost is  to become a lifetime associate at least two weeks prior to delivery of the cattle this will allow enough time for uspb to receive your application and check via mail and then allow you to place cattle on our showlist the name listed on your application must match the name in which cattle payments will be issuedcontact a uspb unitholder with delivery rights available for lease or call tracy thomas director of marketing at  you must lease one delivery right for each animal that you wish to deliver uspb does not regulate lease charges they simply introduce you the potential lessee to the unitholder interested in leasing his or her units lease rates are privately negotiated between the unitholder and the lessee payment will then be made directly from the lessee to the unitholderfax in form b to the uspb office in kansas city by noon monday the week prior to delivery request additional carcass data on form b if desired be sure to designate if the cattle are age and source verifiedafter scheduling and before shipment the local national beef buyer will inspect the cattle at the feedlot unless the cattle are fed outside of the normal buying area in which case the buyer will usually call the feedlot the buyer can assist in lining up trucks for delivery uspb offers a transportation credit of up to  per cwt of live weightnational beef will call the feedlot usually two days prior to delivery to coordinate deliveryon the day of delivery weigh the cattle if scales are not available weigh the truck empty at a nearby scale load and weigh full at the same scale then pencilshrink that weight  to determine your pay weight fax form c to both the uspb office in kansas city and to the plant you are delivering to all fax numbers are on the forms be sure to include on form c an accurate head count the net pay weight percent ownership of each owner total ownership must equal  and any outstanding feed and cattle financing that is payable to the feedyard any errors or omission of data on form c will delay your initial check only as a last resort should you use arrival weight at the plant for your pay weight upon arrival at the plant have the trucker leave a bill of lading for his fees if you lined up the truckingassuming all information on form c is correct the plant will issue your initial check the day the cattle are delivered initial payment is equal to live pay weight x average cash price week prior to delivery x   beef checkoff  any excess trucking costs above freight creditcattle are then processed the carcasses chilled and graded by a usda gradertypically on monday through wednesday of the following week the plant will determine the plant average yield for the week you delivered your cattle the fourweek average for the yield grades and then calculate the grid and make your final payment final payment checks are mailed to the owner with a settlement sheet showing exactly how the value was determined on your cattle and a detailed carcass grade report listing each carcass individually its weight quality grade yield grade and valueif requested premium complete carcass data is mailed to the owner of the cattle several days after the cattle are processed or can be emailed to the owner on the wednesday following the week in which cattle were
