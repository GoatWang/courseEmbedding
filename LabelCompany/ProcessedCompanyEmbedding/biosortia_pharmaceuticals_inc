condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

pharmaceuticals is the only company directly bringing the deep dark chemistry of any microbiome into drug discovery with the most sought after druglike molecules that are generally unobtainable to researchers biosortia is digging into actual unknown microbiome chemistry at  to  times deeper than science has typically explored we have proprietary technologies and capabilities to rapidly fill a discovery pipeline with high priority unmet needs in key therapeutic areas there is an unfilled continuous need by pharma and investment groups to find and exploit ind stage assets biosortia pharmaceuticals is focused on early stage drug discovery to generally an ind stage exit for risk share licensing to pharma or spinningout into a new company this is the most exciting breakthrough in access to new meaningful natural product chemistry for drugs potentially opening the  of unculturable microorganisms in situ to discovery as a reference the  of culturable microorganisms have led directly or indirectly to more the  of the drugs on the market today our vision is to improve human health with our new valuable chemistry researchers around the world recognize the opportunity to find new medicines from various microbiome habitats what is a microbiome simply put it is “the microbial community occupying a reasonably welldefined habitat which has distinct physicochemical properties the term thus not only refers to the microorganisms involved but also encompasses their theaters of activity” the term was first used in  and in print  historically microbiome has delivered a wealth of new drugs microbiome access via culturing historically more than  of the drugs on the shelf have directly or indirectly came from culturable organisms even today culturing microorganism is a successful approach to obtaining elicited chemistry from the  of microbes that can be cultured and the  of those that elicit chemistry in a culture which leaves greater than  of microorganisms that can’t be cultured as virtually inaccessible various strategies to encourage growth of unculturable microorganisms with elicited chemistry could improve rates and many researchers around the world continue to investigate genetic mining of the microbiome research in the early s and various followon attempts to commercialize have advanced the general science of combinatorial genetics but like combinatorial chemistry the mathematical likelihood of delivering predictable success is near infinity the brilliance of natural evolutionary design and the complexity of the process and results are not easy to construct with various snippets of genetics and chemistry in a lab thus progress toward meaningful druglike compounds will likely remain evasive for decades combinatorial chemistry has a minimum of  x  options for small molecules less than  da and combinatorial genetics has options well in excess of that of combinatorial chemistry when including environmental factors and external precursor chemistry real world so what does  x  really mean in terms of testing a new compound well if you had a laboratory create enough starting material and test assay a billion x billion  compounds per second for the next  billion years you will have only tested  x  or a miniscule and meaningless fraction of the possibilities these numbers alone explain why combinatorial chemistry has been such a bust with billions spent annually for decades and only one drug on the market proven to be a complete nonstarter driving up the costs of approved drugs dramatically so why does nature natural products have such an advantage  simply evolution has done more than  x  testing per second for  billion years because of all the tried mutations but rarely kept this simply says the chemistry we seek for new drugs is there for the taking look in the right places and a wealth of new cures will be found  biosortia’s prospecting of microbiome chemistry currently biosortia’s unique technologies allow for recovery of the actual microorganisms of the microbiome from the aquatic environment at a quality and quantity that allows direct chemical prospecting this approach is similar

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

advances in genomics personalized medicine and immunotherapy the new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth together these advancements are helping patients live longer healthier and more productive lives personalized medicine personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers often genetic to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient personalized medicine may change the healthcare treatment landscape forever learn how america’s biopharmaceutical companies are fighting cancer on the front lines with “smart bombs” learn more what works for one patient may not for another see how researchers are at the forefront of treatment immunotherapy immunotherapy is an alternative to traditional treatments like radiation or chemotherapy which focus on killing cancer cells directly with immunotherapy the body’s own immune system is harnessed to eliminate cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread immunotherapy offers millions of americans a brighter future read more innovation

pharmaceuticals is the only company directly bringing the deep dark chemistry of any microbiome into drug discovery with the most sought after druglike molecules that are generally unobtainable to researchers biosortia is digging into actual unknown microbiome chemistry at  to  times deeper than science has typically explored we have proprietary technologies and capabilities to rapidly fill a discovery pipeline with high priority unmet needs in key therapeutic areas there is an unfilled continuous need by pharma and investment groups to find and exploit ind stage assets biosortia pharmaceuticals is focused on early stage drug discovery to generally an ind stage exit for risk share licensing to pharma or spinningout into a new company this is the most exciting breakthrough in access to new meaningful natural product chemistry for drugs potentially opening the  of unculturable microorganisms in situ to discovery as a reference the  of culturable microorganisms have led directly or indirectly to more the  of the drugs on the market today our vision is to improve human health with our new valuable chemistry researchers around the world recognize the opportunity to find new medicines from various microbiome habitats what is a microbiome simply put it is “the microbial community occupying a reasonably welldefined habitat which has distinct physicochemical properties the term thus not only refers to the microorganisms involved but also encompasses their theaters of activity” the term was first used in  and in print  historically microbiome has delivered a wealth of new drugs microbiome access via culturing historically more than  of the drugs on the shelf have directly or indirectly came from culturable organisms even today culturing microorganism is a successful approach to obtaining elicited chemistry from the  of microbes that can be cultured and the  of those that elicit chemistry in a culture which leaves greater than  of microorganisms that can’t be cultured as virtually inaccessible various strategies to encourage growth of unculturable microorganisms with elicited chemistry could improve rates and many researchers around the world continue to investigate genetic mining of the microbiome research in the early s and various followon attempts to commercialize have advanced the general science of combinatorial genetics but like combinatorial chemistry the mathematical likelihood of delivering predictable success is near infinity the brilliance of natural evolutionary design and the complexity of the process and results are not easy to construct with various snippets of genetics and chemistry in a lab thus progress toward meaningful druglike compounds will likely remain evasive for decades combinatorial chemistry has a minimum of  x  options for small molecules less than  da and combinatorial genetics has options well in excess of that of combinatorial chemistry when including environmental factors and external precursor chemistry real world so what does  x  really mean in terms of testing a new compound well if you had a laboratory create enough starting material and test assay a billion x billion  compounds per second for the next  billion years you will have only tested  x  or a miniscule and meaningless fraction of the possibilities these numbers alone explain why combinatorial chemistry has been such a bust with billions spent annually for decades and only one drug on the market proven to be a complete nonstarter driving up the costs of approved drugs dramatically so why does nature natural products have such an advantage  simply evolution has done more than  x  testing per second for  billion years because of all the tried mutations but rarely kept this simply says the chemistry we seek for new drugs is there for the taking look in the right places and a wealth of new cures will be found  biosortia’s prospecting of microbiome chemistry currently biosortia’s unique technologies allow for recovery of the actual microorganisms of the microbiome from the aquatic environment at a quality and quantity that allows direct chemical prospecting this approach is similar to culturing except the culture is the natural habitat of the aquatic microbiome the previous phenomenal successes in finding new drugs from the  culturable microorganisms allow a incredibly high probability of finding new meaningful opportunities from new access to the  that has remained truly inaccessible httpwwwmicrobenetwhatdoesthetermmicrobiomemeanandwherediditcomefromabitofasurprise
