in equity and increased our revolving credit facility by  million for the purpose of funding our acquisition activity above critical accounting policies in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances we believe that table of contents our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues credit losses fair values either as part of a purchase price allocation impairment analysis or in valuing certain of our ernest investments periodic depreciation of our real estate assets and stock compensation expense along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results have significant effects on our financial statements each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments we rely on our experience collect historical and current market data and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates under different conditions or assumptions materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below in addition application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could materially differ from these estimates our accounting estimates include the following revenue recognition we receive income from operating leases based on the fixed minimum required rents base rents per the lease agreements rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straightline method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for those acquired as part of a property acquisition the straightline method records the periodic average amount of base rent earned over the term of a lease taking into account contractual rent adjustments over the lease term the straightline method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease during the later parts of a lease term this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay rent revenue as recorded on the straightline method in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts billed rent revenue and straightline revenue billed rent revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease straightline rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straightline method and the amount recorded as billed rent revenue we record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements as applicable as an increase or decrease to straightline rent receivable certain leases may provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenants revenues in excess of specified base amountthreshold percentage rents percentage rents are recognized in the period in which revenue thresholds are met rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as deferred revenue we also receive additional rent contingent rent under some leases based on increases in the consumer price index or where the consumer price index exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase in the lease contingent rents are recorded as billed rent revenue in the period earned we use direct finance lease accounting dfl to record rent on certain leases deemed to be financing leases per accounting rules rather than operating leases for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectability of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized and unearned income in instances where we have a profits or equity interest in our tenants operations we record income equal to our percentage interest of the tenants profits as defined in the lease or tenants operating agreements once annual thresholds if any are met we begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility which may be different from the stated start date of the lease also during construction of our development projects we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period construction period rent we accrue construction period rent as a receivable with a corresponding offset to deferred revenue during the construction period when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility we begin recognizing the deferred construction period revenue on the straightline method over the remaining term of the lease we receive interest income from our tenantsborrowers on mortgage loans working capital loans and other longterm loans interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans table of contents commitment fees received from development and leasing services for lessees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of a lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease interest method commitment and origination fees from lending services are also recorded as deferred revenue initially and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method investments in real estate we maintain our investments in real estate at cost and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset while our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance we expense those costs as incurred we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the weightedaverage useful life of approximately  years for buildings and improvements when circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments we review the recoverability of the facilitys carrying value the review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the facilitys use and eventual disposition our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income market and other applicable trends and residual value as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis such as was the case with our monroe and bucks facilities in  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility we do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at december   however given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken acquired real estate purchase price allocation for existing properties acquired for leasing purposes we account for such acquisitions based on business combination accounting rules we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate we may utilize a number of sources including available real estate broker data independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property internal data from previous acquisitions or developments and other market data we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired we record abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values if any for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between we measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with new or inplace leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant when acquired managements estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg discounted cash flow analysis factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases we also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in estimating carrying costs management includes real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods which we expect to be about six months depending on specific local market conditions management table of contents also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions legal costs and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values which are based on managements evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenants lease and our overall relationship with that tenant characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement among other factors at december   we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles we amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases which have a weighted average useful life of  years at december   if a lease is terminated the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense losses from rent receivables for all leases we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including but not limited to admission levels and surgeryprocedure volumes by type current operating margins ratio of our tenants operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs trends in revenue and patient mix and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants profitability and liquidity losses from operating lease receivables we utilize the information above along with the tenants payment and default history in evaluating on a propertybyproperty basis whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding rent receivables is needed a provision for losses on rent receivables including straightline rent receivables is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full the provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral if any losses on dfl receivables allowances are established for dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual dfls deemed to be impaired dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease like operating lease receivables the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessees overall financial condition economic resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the dfls effective interest rate fair value of collateral and other relevant factors as appropriate dfls are placed on nonaccrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not    mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage amd puts intel

activity above critical accounting policies in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances we believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues credit losses fair values either as part of a purchase price allocation impairment analysis or in valuing certain of our equity investments periodic depreciation of our real estate assets and stock compensation expense along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results have significant effects on our financial statements each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments we rely on our experience collect historical and current market data and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates under different conditions or assumptions materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below in addition application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could materially differ from these estimates our accounting estimates include the following revenue recognition we receive income from operating leases based on the fixed minimum required rents base rents per the lease agreements rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straightline method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for those acquired as part of a property acquisition the straightline method records the periodic average amount of base table of contents rent earned over the term of a lease taking into account contractual rent adjustments over the lease term the straightline method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease during the later parts of a lease term this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay rent revenue as recorded on the straightline method in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts rent billed revenue and straightline revenue rent billed revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease straightline rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straightline method and the amount recorded as rent billed revenue we record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements as applicable as an increase or decrease to straightline rent receivable certain leases may provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenants revenues in excess of specified base amountthreshold percentage rents percentage rents are recognized in the period in which revenue thresholds are met rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as deferred revenue we also receive additional rent contingent rent under some leases based on increases in the consumer price index or where the consumer price index exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase in the lease contingent rents are recorded as rent billed revenue in the period earned we use direct finance lease dfl accounting to record rent on certain leases deemed to be financing leases per accounting rules rather than operating leases for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectability of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized and unearned income in instances where we have a profits or equity interest in our tenants operations we record income equal to our percentage interest of the tenants profits as defined in the lease or tenants operating agreements once annual thresholds if any are met we begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility which may be different from the stated start date of the lease also during construction of our development projects we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period construction period rent we accrue construction period rent as a receivable with a corresponding offset to deferred revenue during the construction period when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility we begin recognizing the deferred construction period revenue on the straightline method over the remaining term of the lease we receive interest income from our tenantsborrowers on mortgage loans working capital loans and other longterm loans interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans commitment fees received from development and leasing services for lessees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of a lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease interest method commitment and origination fees from lending services are also recorded as deferred revenue initially and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method investments in real estate we maintain our investments in real estate at cost and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset while our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance we expense those costs as incurred we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the weightedaverage useful life of approximately  years for buildings and improvements table of contents when circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments we review the recoverability of the facilitys carrying value the review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the facilitys use and eventual disposition our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income market and other applicable trends and residual value as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis such as was the case with our monroe and bucks facilities in  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility we do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at december   however given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken acquired real estate purchase price allocation for existing properties acquired for leasing purposes we account for such acquisitions based on business combination accounting rules we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate we may utilize a number of sources including available real estate broker data independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property internal data from previous acquisitions or developments and other market data we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired we record abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values if any for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between we measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with new or inplace leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant when acquired managements estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg discounted cash flow analysis factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases we also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in estimating carrying costs management includes real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods which we expect to be about six months based on experience depending on specific local market conditions management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions legal costs and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values which are based on managements evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenants lease and our overall relationship with that tenant characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement among other factors at december   we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles table of contents we amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases which have a weighted average useful life of  years at december   if a lease is terminated the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense  as was the case with our twelve oaks facility in  losses from rent receivables for all leases we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including but not limited to admission levels and surgeryprocedure volumes by type current operating margins ratio of our tenants operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs trends in revenue and patient mix and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants profitability and liquidity losses from operating lease receivables we utilize the information above along with the tenants payment and default history in evaluating on a propertybyproperty basis whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding rent receivables is needed a provision for losses on rent receivables including straightline rent receivables is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full the provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral if any in regards to our florence and twelve oaks facilities we analyzed whether or not a provision of loss was needed at december   based on the outstanding receivables due to us however after reviewing the tenants business all available credit enhancements such as letters of credit and subsequent cash receipts we believe no such provision was needed at this time however no assurances can be given that future provisions of losses will not be taken losses on dfl receivables allowances are established for dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual dfls deemed to be impaired dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease like operating lease receivables the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessees overall financial condition economic resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the dfls effective interest rate fair value of collateral and other relevant factors as appropriate dfls are placed on nonaccrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status we generally account for the dfls on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash loans loans consist of mortgage loans working capital loans and other longterm loans mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property working capital and other longterm loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees we record loans at cost we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loanbyloan basis using the same process as we do for assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above to determine whether they are
