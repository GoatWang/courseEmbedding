 of our total cost of sales over the last several years vf has shifted production from the united states to lower cost locations as a result of this shift in sourcing approximately  of our domestic net sales in  were manufactured in vfowned facilities primarily in mexico and central america and  were obtained from contractors primarily in asia similarly european jeanswear sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in western europe to lower cost owned production outside of western europe and contracted production in the middle east africa and asia to an increasing extent we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship only finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong and miami these hubs are responsible for product procurement product quality assurance and supplier management and handling functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively all products in the outdoor and sportswear coalitions as well as a growing portion of product requirements for our other coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubsthe current sourcing strategy for products sold in the united states allows us to balance our needs with a mix of vfowned and contracted production in the western hemisphere combined with contracted production primarily from asia owned production generally has a lower cost than contracted production overall product obtained from the western hemisphere has somewhat higher cost but gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as compared with production obtained from the far east and other more distant resources this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions
