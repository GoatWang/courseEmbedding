bernard williams ludwig wittgenstein susan wolf scientists home  solutions  philosophers  richard l franklin richard l franklin richard l franklin the australian philosopher developed an idea of indeterministic libertarian freedom as the selective directing of attention in our thoughts which develop intentions preparatory to actions this rough idea seems to be in much earlier thought eg william jamess principles of psychology and franklin seems unaware of the importance of the concept of focusing attention in modern psychology and cognitive science franklin is enthusiastic about analytical language philosophical techniques inspired by ludwig wittgenstein which dissolve philosophical problems he is not embarrassed to say that such a concept puts human freedom outside the natural causal order which he believes is causal and deterministic his view is thus in the category of metaphysical freedoms such as agent causation nonoccurrent causation and contracausal freedom he cites r m hare wilfred sellars richard taylor and others as holding similar views excerpts from franklins freewill and determinism routledge kegan paul  the problem ppfra the problem of freewill is always with us both libertarianism and determinism and each in many forms have been proved to the satisfaction of innumerable protagonists while to the satisfaction of innumerable others the conflict has been dissolved has been shown to rest on misunderstandings of the concepts involved the thesis of this book is both more modest and more ambitious than any of these it is more modest in that though i have argued for one particular view i have not claimed to present conclusive reasons for it and in fact i have tried to show in what respects and on what grounds it could and would be rationally rejected by many men it is more ambitious in that i believe i have placed the problem in a new perspective i have suggested why there is this neverending dispute what underlies the contentions of each position why at a given period one may be in the ascendent over others why the protagonists so easily in fact almost inevitably overstate their cases and finally what might offer the best chance of future progress let us begin with a simple statement of the problem and of the positions which may be adopted men do not often doubt that in most circumstances they can freely decide between one course of action and another in a way that certainly inanimate objects and presumably also animals cannot nor in the realm of morals do they often doubt that unless a man chose freely he cannot properly be praised or blamed for his action these beliefs give rise to a problem however when they are considered together with other frequently held ones which may seem to leave no place for such freedom there thus arises the philosophical problem of freewill historically the difficulty has often been that of reconciling freedom with beliefs in gods omniscience or foreordination of all things which raise what may be called questions of predestination in the present climate of opinion among british philosophers these issues have been largely handed over to theologians and for reasons of space i shall largely have to leave them there i am concerned with another set of considerations which give rise to what may be called the problem of determinism people not only make choices they explain why choices are made and they predict what they will be if we reflect on what is involved in explanation or prediction we may conclude that they always involve some more or less explicit and more or less precise generalisation to the effect that this sort of thing occurs in this sort of situation the ideal limit of such a generalisation is a causal or scientific law to which there are no exceptions moreover on further reflection we may decide we cannot doubt that such laws exist even if undiscovered for we can hardly doubt that in principle all that occurs is fully explicable and only this ideal limit it may seem would give a really satisfactory explanation in traditional language the law of causation that every event has a cause is equivalent to the principle of sufficient reason by virtue of which as leibniz formulates it we consider that no fact can be real or existing and no proposition can be true unless there is a sufficient reason why it should be thus and not otherwise even though in most cases these reasons cannot be known to us and on this principle together with the principle of contradiction he said all our reasoning is based yet the existence of such causal laws may seem to imply that for a given agent in a given situation only one course of action is a real possibility and may thus seem incompatible with his freedom to this general problem philosophers return many different answers but they may conveniently be grouped into three types one position is that our distinctive human power to choose implies contracausal or undetermined freedom this is libertarianism it divides into various forms which differ as to whether all or only some and if so which choices imply indeterminism for example one form holds that we have undetermined freedom only when facing up to moral demands the second group consists of philosophers who accept the incompatibility which the libertarian alleges between causality and at least the usual notion of freedom accept as he does not the principle of universal causation and thus reject the belief in freedom these are par excellence determinists we may however distinguish two subgroups first there are those who aim to break to men the news that they are in no significant sense free secondly there are those who set out to reconcile determinism with some consciously transformed notion of freedom they agree that the common or unphilosophical notion of freedom inclines to libertarianism but argue that this is a vulgar error and that true freedom is say the recognition of necessity the less that such a philosopher emphasises or concedes that his view of freedom is not the common one the more he merges into a third group these deny that the suggested incompatibility between freedom and universal causation exists at all they refuse to save the notion of freedom by transforming it they believe it is not the common man but the philosopher who is confused since they suggest we all assume both that we are free and that all events can be explained it is for the philosopher to show by careful analysis how these beliefs fit together and not to sacrifice either to the other if we thus examine carefully what is under our noses we will discover what we might have expected that the apparent conflict is due to various conceptual errors such as in the realm of morals a faulty analysis of the concept of responsibility or of the assertion that the agent could have done something else we will then see that what we all mean by freedom and not some truncated or transformed account of it is compatible with and perhaps requires determinism traditionally there are only two classifications libertarian and determinist to apply to all these positions for the word indeterminist which is sometimes found seems to be nothing but a synonym for libertarian this leads to little confusion except in the case of the third group of philosophers libertarian suggests to them that we have an undetermined freedom and determinist that we are not as free as we thought and it is the very point of their contention that both these suggestions are wrong since they claim that on a proper analysis the problem dissolves i find it sometimes useful to call them dissolutionists in general there are some contexts such as that of clarifying the precise libertarian position where it is convenient to call all denials of libertarianism determinist and others including many ethical ones where the threefold classification is more helpful but all such nomenclature is merely a matter of convenience and i do not wish to pin on anyone a label to which he would object   a determinist is commonly defined as one who asserts that all choices are caused it might therefore seem that dissolutionism is necessarily a species of determinism namely that which asserts the compatibility of determinism with freedom but it is in fact a crossclassification some dissolutionists profess to be agnostic about universal causation and therefore are not determinists they maintain merely that whether or not choices are caused they may still be free the central issue may be put in terms of a contrast between two notions which may be called selfdeterminism and indeterminism no one other than an absurd fatalist would suggest that a man is in normal circumstances at the mercy of his environment as a rudderless boat is driven by the waves it is we who decide how to act and act as we decide we respond to situations with more or less intelligence and integrity another person or we in a different mood might respond to the same situation quite differently no account of a mans environment and external stimuli would usually enable us to know what he will do the answer will depend on his own deliberation and choice we might express this manifest ability of human beings to transcend a mere immediate reaction to stimuli by saying that they are selfdetermined but this is quite compatible with saying that there are causal or scientific laws for example psychological ones about thoughtprocesses or physiological ones about brainprocesses which govern an agents decision the fact that a full causal account would have to be enormously complicated that it would have to include statements about the agent as well as about his environment and that it cannot in practice be achieved does not show that it is in principle unobtainable so selfdeterminism is compatible with determinism indeed it is the only intelligent form of determinism the determinist says that this selfdeterminism is the only sense if any in which a man is free and the dissolutionist adds that it is in fact all we mean when we speak of human freedom the libertarian however denies this he insists that such laws if they existed would be incompatible with our most basic conception of freedom his view may be put by saying that mans freedom is undetermined  he often objects to this word for it may suggest that undetermined choices are purely random and thus concede too much to the determinist but i here use it only to refer to the feature of the libertarian position that it denies complete causal determinism and this negative feature is appropriately expressed by a negative word the selective directing of attention pp in daydreams and in other relaxed or lazy moments we may be conscious in one sense of that vague word without paying attention to anything but as soon as we become involved in or concerned with any situation or train of thought we start to pay attention to it the activities such as choices with which the freewill debate is concerned are primarily ones which are performed attentively it is this difficult and fundamental notion of attention which i wish to examine though it is possible with difficulty to pay attention to more than one thing at once our consciousness is normally focused on one the focus however often changes as when our attention is distracted by something else while we are engaged on some matter to which in general it is directed it is not easy however to decide how often this occurs we might be tempted to try to answer the question by paying attention to some topic and at the same time noticing how often our attention is distracted but if we do we are apt to find that what we had taken to be our reasonably sustained power of concentration dissolves into a kaleidoscope of shifting phenomena let someone read this paragraph while paying heed to the question how often his attention wanders  and almost at once i think it will the buzzing of a fly the memory of a past holiday wondering what the time is or whether the whole procedure is absurd—such things as these will immediately intervene moreover if he succeeds in reaching the end of the paragraph he will find he can hardly remember much of it this suggests that the whole approach is at fault for it involves precisely that attempt to focus consciousness on more than one thing at once which we find so difficult we are here so exercised in the secondorder activity of trying to notice what we are conscious of that we lose almost entirely our firstorder capacity to concentrate on anything at all if on the other hand forgetting this peculiar exercise someone should after reading a paragraph with attention ask himself whether his attention had wandered i think he will normally be unable to recollect that it had this cannot be merely because these wanderings are immediately forgotten for apart from the inherent implausibility of that suggestion there is the unquestionable difference in the speed and comprehension of his reading the capacity to pay attention doubtless varies greatly between individuals certain cases such as the very highest reaches of disciplined religious meditation are almost different in kind from achievements in the lower range no doubt also in each individual the power varies in accordance with many factors it is much greater when we are attracted to some subject matter than when we force ourselves to concentrate on it it is also much greater when the subject matter on which we focus is itself changing for example most people can read a book that is keep their attention on a progression of words and sentences for a much longer period than they can fixedly contemplate a single unchanging object but for present purposes these matters need not concern us and the following points which i have made are sufficient one may be conscious without paying attention to anything activity of any sort however including coherent and connected thought involves paying attention our power to do so can be exercised without break for much longer than we might conclude from the unfortunate attempt to introspect the process while it goes on yet nevertheless it is an essential feature of our paying attention in all but the rarest and most highly disciplined cases that the focus of our consciousness is continually changing it is these changes of focus which i wish to consider and i wish to ask whether one can appropriately apply to them certain distinctions that have often been recognised in other contexts the first distinction is that between an action and an occurrence or between what a man does and what happens to him this as i shall later mention seems an essential distinction in philosophy of mind the second one is drawn within the realm of action or activity between an act and a choice on some occasions a man may simply act without any deliberate selection of his course of action while on other occasions he chooses between two possible courses of conduct the notion of a choice as here used implies that alternatives are considered and all but one rejected how if at all do these notions apply to the paying of attention a philosopher might be inclined to say that changes in our attention are mental acts as opposed to occurrences such as twinges of pain for if we put aside special cases as when a subject attracts us with a virtually hypnotic power or repels us so strongly as to produce a mental blockage we may agree that we can always control the movement of our attention even if only with difficulty but to say that we can control it is not to say that we do our attention is continually being attracted by what we would like to think about or distracted from what we are or ought to be thinking about or as it were rebuffed by the dullness or unpleasantness of the subject matter these influences account for the direction taken by a vast amount of our thinking particularly in our less disciplined moments they are part of our mental activity in the sense that they are what goes on while we think yet in another sense they are what happens to us rather than what we do we seem therefore driven though such moves are perilous in philosophy to draw a further distinction within the realm of mental activity between the relatively passive and the more fundamentally active in fact i think we must apply the distinctions between occurrence action and choice in this more minute field as we are accustomed to do in larger scale activities the cases where the movement of our attention is attracted distracted or rebuffed involve nothing which in the strictest sense we do a distinct if rarer phenomenon is the active switching of attention from one thing to another a man who has to decide a matter may suddenly notice that he is daydreaming about some topic suggested by his earlier train of thought and the very realisation of this fact is enough to cause him to direct his attention immediately back to the issue he has to decide this directing is quite different in kind from the unconscious distraction which led him to the daydream and as compared to the latter it is activity as opposed to what happened to him yet it is hardly a choice he did not decide to stop daydreaming rather the realisation that he was daydreaming led to his stopping it now within this directing of attention which is itself a subclass of the changes in our attention there is a yet smaller subsubclass which seems to me to correspond strictly to the notion of a choice and indeed it is a genuine choice though of a minute kind this arises when we consciously decide between pursuing or dwelling on this consideration or that whether our deliberation is concerned to reach some truth or some decision about how to act we may be faced with a situation which can be described by saying that we are aware of two trains of thought which we might dwell on and that we select one and we decide to pursue it rather than the other i shall call this the selective directing of attention and it is on this notion that i shall concentrate in the next section i have no definite suggestion as to how often the selective directing of attention may occur i suspect that the frequency of its occurrence varies from individual to individual and it surely varies according to the type of thought involved certainly it represents only a small proportion of the changes in our attention but these changes as a whole are so frequent that even this subsubclass of them need not be a rare phenomenon my own view would be that for any normal person engaged in rigorous or careful thought it is a common occurrence in any case the distinctions which i have attempted to draw do seem to me to apply to the very difficult phenomena in question even if in certain cases the line between the various categories may be somewhat blurred it follows that it is unconvincing to reduce the process of thought to any account which presents it merely as an interplay of attractive and distractive influences undoubtedly such influences occur and govern a vast amount of our thinking further we may have psychological evidence to suppose that there are others of the existence or power of which we are frequently unaware but if we attempt to reduce all mental activity to the passive interplay of various influences the result is not a satisfactory piece of philosophical psychology before going further i must relate my remarks to a discussion in professor stuart hampshires important book thought and action  the issue arises from a passage where he is concerned to emphasise the difference between thought and action  he is right i think basically to take the side of spinoza against descartes on this point and to say that reaching a conclusion is not analogous to an act of will we do not decide to believe we decide or realise that we believe and if the process has been honest the conclusion is independent of our will he is right also in the hints he gives of the necessary qualifications to this position and his indications of the way in which our will to believe or disbelieve may influence the thinking process finally he is right in saying that this may have deep moral implications the difference arises when he argues that what goes on in us when we think systematically cannot be described as an action because the will plays no part in it  london chatto  windus  it is not my purpose to make a detailed comment on this work  op cit pp  et seq thought when it is most pure is selfdirecting as in the exercise of the intellect in deduction and in the following of an argument when i use the active verbs of will and speak of directing my thoughts to a certain topic or of concentrating my attention on it i still contrast these acts of will which start the process from the process itself thought begins on its own path governed by its universal rules when the preliminary work of the will is done no process of thought could be punctuated by acts of will voluntary switchings of attention and retain its status as a continuous process of thought   op cit pp  my emphasis the point is impressive if we concentrate on the case of following an argument or of expounding one when we have worked it out here the direction of thought is in an intelligible sense controlled by the argument and the only element of will involved is that of renewing our attention if we notice that it has flagged perhaps this is all hampshire meant but in original or constructive thinking the directing of attention seems ubiquitous and essential certainly from time to time it may lead to the recognition of a conceptual connection of course this follows from that we may say or but this wont go with what i concluded previously still the movement of our thought is directed not by a chain of argument but by our groping for one it is controlled by the argument not as the movement of a train is controlled by the rails but only as that of an explorer is controlled by the country in the last resort if the italicised sentence of hampshires were true then creative thinking would not be a continuous process of thought  indeterminism as the selective directing of attention i now argue that a libertarianism which is rationally constructed out of the common view of choice should locate its indeterminism in the selective directing of attention in the first place this suggestion is surely thoroughly congruous with the four cases where i suggested that the common view would insist on indeterminism in a clash between what is believed to be our duty and temptation what actually happens at the moment of decision is it not that we either direct our attention to the fact that this is our duty and refuse to think about the attractiveness of the other course or alternatively dwell on the attractiveness of the other course and simply try to put our duty out of our mind as best we can the second case of honesty in deliberation is even clearer for it was defined by reference to the difficulty of keeping our attention fixed on matters which we ought to consider the third case was that of moral perplexity here the position would seem to be that having found no satisfactory rational solution of our dilemma and still being obliged to choose we simply by an act of will direct our attention to one course rather than the other finally in relation to the whole sphere of original thinking does not the originality lie in the selection of one aspect after another for attention in the hope of seeing familiar things in a new light making new connections or questioning established ones all else that there is even in genius is surely an achievement which either comes or does not whence and how it does is a matter on which common men have no opinion and the learned no consensus creative freedom is exercised in grappling with the matter not in achieving the result this may be reinforced by another consideration in so far as the common view is based on the selective directing of attention the most obvious cases of indeterminism will be those where the directing is most obvious all such frequent activities are commonly best thrown into relief when we experience difficulty in performing them the difficulties in selectively directing our attention are of two sorts a the keeping of our attention fixed on some chosen consideration in the face of some counterconsideration which attracts us or makes a demand on our attention b when we are faced with difficulty in ordering a complicated set of material and must therefore direct our attention systematically over the whole of it we may add as a crossclassification that the directing of attention may be apparent either i as a decision or act of choice at the end of deliberation or ii as an element in the deliberation itself now the four suggested paradigms of indeterminism represent fairly well the four possible combinations of these elements moral libertarianism is case a i where the choice rather than the deliberation is to be exercised in the face of the attraction to dwell on other matters the second example is case a ii the third case is b i and the fourth is b ii the fact that these cases fit so neatly into this classification gives some support to the view that the classification expresses their underlying principle my suggestion seems equally compatible with cases where the actual choice is thought of as selfdetermined first we may put aside cases where a man acts as we often do in small matters without really noticing what he is doing the notion of directing attention let alone of selectively directing it need here hardly arise but also we hardly speak of choice where there is choice between alternatives there is doubtless some selective directing of attention but in some cases it is as it were essentially irrelevant to the final outcome sometimes the result of deliberation is to bring us to see that only one course really has anything from our point of view to commend it we might say that the deliberation had its elements of indeterminism in the sense that we might have explored either this or that aspect first etc but that the eventual decision did not again a man may be of such firm character that he knows in advance that however much he directs his attention to various aspects of his situation it will not alter his decision this for example might be luthers case here one might say that though the precise course of the deliberation was undetermined the outcome was never in doubt these seem to me the sort of cases where the common view would say that given the mans character only one course was a real possibility for him the picture at which we arrive is that in serious cases of deliberation and choice there is a frequent selective directing of attention which i suggest should be seen as the basis of libertarianism but its significance varies from case to case sometimes it may affect no more than the trivial details of a path which in general we could have predicted that the agent would traverse there are innumerable intermediate cases in which it becomes relatively more important at the other end of the range its existence in a given situation may be crucial a mans whole action and even his whole future may depend on the minute movement of thought by which he chooses to attend to one consideration rather than to another it is a matter of profound importance for our conception of man whether or not we see such a movement as only a special case of general laws and thus as an example of what would always happen if just this situation should repeat itself i have spoken of this position as a rational reconstruction of the common view of choice i do not suggest that the directing of attention is the only consideration which might commonly lead men to a belief in indeterminism in fact i suspect that at least two other matters related to each other would play a part the first is what i may call the lack of expectation of precise prediction in understanding human conduct and indeed generally outside the realm of the exact sciences we must normally employ generalisations which are expected to have occasional exceptions and this may incline men to the view that no precise regularities could in principle be obtained the second related matter is the obvious fact of sheer human uniqueness after all if two candidates were to submit examination answers which were even largely the same in wording the presumption that they were not independently produced would be irrebuttable yet both these considerations seem to me to lack cogency my basic reason for this which will emerge more fully when i discuss determinism is frankly conceptual rather than based on the phenomenology of choice and action it is that if the sorts of complexity and uniqueness which i have just mentioned cannot even in principle be reduced to regularities in however complicated a way then it would seem that they simply cannot be explained at all whereas cases of the selective directing of attention allow an explanation of a radically different and nondeterminist sort the result is that i would not wish to defend any libertarianism other than that which i have outlined i do not directly appeal to the common view in support of my position as if to a majority verdict but i believe my position is not only largely consistent with what most men would hold but also is held for reasons which would appeal to them henceforth i shall call the view i have outlined libertarianism i shall now turn to consider some of the ways in which it has been alleged that the problem dissolves  assessment of the issues pp i must begin by stating my own position i have elaborated a libertarian view based on the selective directing of attention which i have presented as the most defensible form of the doctrine in terms of the current debate this is the position i would hold but it would be more accurate to say i am not a determinist for if i had to bet on what the future holds i would put my money on the suggestion mentioned in chapter ii section  that the future course of discovery would produce what i called a scientific transformation of the problem this suggestion is that an adequate neurophysiology will eventually erode the assumption usually made by determinist and libertarian alike namely the assumption that we could in principle specify with unlimited pre vision the state of affairs which would turn out to be or fail to be a sufficient condition for its successor the eroding of this assumption might occur in either of two ways the first is that the relevant phenomena in the brain might be so minute that heisenbergs uncertainty principle assuming that it is not itself superseded would suffice to raise a necessary imprecision in the specification of the total situation or secondly a new sort of complexity hitherto completely unknown might be brought to light in other words the emergent levels of relations between neurons in masses postulated by bullock might in crucial cases be such that the concepts required for determinism were inapplicable  any such scientific transformation would seem however for reasons i shall mention to be much more akin to libertarianism than determinism  t h bullock in behavior and evolution eds a roe amd g g simpson p  both these seem to me fundamentally different conceptions from the suggestion which has sometimes been made that the activity of a mental force might be empirically discovered by its influence on a physical system namely the brain which otherwise would behave in a different manner in accordance with the relevant laws of physics my reasons for holding this view are various in the first place i am aware of more than those i can state here though the others are like the ones i shall mention persuasive only this seems to me appropriate for if we are seeking to draw together separate puzzles into a coherent account which offers an ultimate explanation then it would follow that the debate must be discursive it would be impossible to indicate in advance what might be relevant or to confine the discussion within set limits a persuasive consideration drawn from one field may have to be balanced against an opposing one drawn from another i shall here make one point not with thoroughness but as an illustration of this discursiveness it is that there are significant links between the whole debate about freewill and traditional religious beliefs i do not mean to suggest that no theist can be a determinist but there are i think relatively subterranean and easily missed elements of congruity which lead from theism to a denial of determinism if not vice versa i see in fact more than one such element but one will do as illustration traditional morality rests on desert and an ethic of intentions as we might expect whatever the problems of temporal and logical priority this is paralleled in the traditional religious notion of a final moral accounting determinists who reject the traditional moral values for an ethic of consequences would have to reject or transform this religious notion too what they could put in its place if so minded will not concern me here i have argued however that a determinist may keep something like the traditional moral values based on respect for personality by substituting for the ontological responsibility of libertarianism a responsibility of selfacceptance my present question is whether a parallel conceptual move could be made in the religious sphere it might seem a priori certain that it could be for surely the theists categories derive in the first place from our ideal of human personality at its best before being transformed in an attempt to do justice to the notion of a being worthy of worship if moral goodness is a preeminent constituent of our ideal how could it fail to have analogical application to the divine but the issue is not nearly so simple for the relation of divine to human is fundamentally different from the relation of man to man and it would seem to me that there are difficulties which might well be insuperable in any analogical extension at all first i have suggested that an ethic of selfacceptance might have to justify the infliction of penalties on those who denied their responsibility by falling back on a social pressure view in human relationships this would be entirely legitimate society must survive but is there a divine analogue god has no need to protect himself any notion of justified penalties therefore could get going only if there were selfacceptance in traditional language god could justly condemn to hell only those who admitted they deserved it secondly what good reason could they have for admitting it i can understand what it would be as between man and man rationally to accept oneself and others as responsible agents despite the belief that one could not nomically have done otherwise for in whatever sense i may be responsible for my act at least it is clear that those before whom i acknowledge it are not responsible for it but in what sense would it be rational to accept responsibility before a being which had created me to be the very entity which being just as it was must commit the sins for which responsibility is being attributed the closest human analogies might well seem to be not with mature admission of ones faults but with neurotic and compulsive guiltfeelings finally if a man did in fact accept responsibility for his sins his doing so would of course also be predetermined again as between man and man this need not destroy the seriousness and legitimacy of the attitude since the others do not cause me to accept my responsibility but god in the last resort would be the cause and this does seem to destroy moral seriousness a ventriloquist does not prove himself right by getting his dummy to agree with him my suggestion is that even if a determinist wished to retain the notion of desert by basing it on selfacceptance the move which seems possible in the purely moral sphere may be impossible in the religious in arguing this i have of course partly transgressed my selfdenying ordinance and have taken sides on the theological question of whether predestination can be reconciled with the justice of god for though i have not discussed how the crucial texts of a revelation are to be interpreted i have in effect suggested that even if they implied both predestination and divine justice which in the case of christianity i strongly doubt there would remain a conceptual point of the sort where philosophers have professional competence it is thatjustice could logically be here employed only in a pickwickian sense which was incompatible with its ordinary meaning but my purpose has not been to pronounce even on the latter issue it has been only to illustrate by means of an example the ramifications in which we may be involved in any final assessment of the freewill issue contemporary philosophy has found great profit in the method of isolating small and precise problems for individual treatment it is therefore all the more important to insist that there may be some issues including the present where this method is inapplicable by this illustration i have tried to indicate the point of my proviso that i have more reasons for denying determinism than those now mentioned for i would wish to elaborate a view within which the denial appeared as rationally integrated with rather than incongruously attached to other beliefs about man and the universe as a whole i cannot attempt this now but i can give my final assessment of the considerations discussed in this book to many philosophers it has seemed that reflection on practical and on theoretical reason tends to lead in different directions and thus to provide the central tension in the freewill problem reflection on how we decide whether in general or solely in moral situations raises the demand for indeterminism reflection on how we explain a fact to be the case leads naturally to a belief in regularity i would agree that this is the natural division of the matters to be considered but i do not think the dichotomy is as neat as this i find that in both areas the arguments against determinism seem the stronger though in the first case perhaps more than in the second and in neither case for conclusive reasons i shall begin with practical reason first i repeat that the natural view of choice is not determinist and that determinism must be an attitude superimposed on an earlier view it is an attitude which i cannot achieve i am for example quite unable to agree with freud that we are inclined to believe in the undetermined freedom of our trivial but not of our fundamental choices on the contrary there stand out in my mind several important issues of past years where it seems to me even now that i well might have decided the other way in which case my life would have been notably different to what it is further at the more minute level of careful introspection i think that the selective directing of attention is of fundamental importance i am prepared to believe that all other phenomena which occur in deliberation such as the attractions and distractions which play so large a part in it are determined by causes of which i am not necessarily aware for otherwise since we do not in such cases select or choose our train of thought there would be no reason why the outcome should be this rather than that but the selective directing of attention alone seems to demand that we apply it to the notion of a deliberate choice between alternatives both its sheer phenomenological distinctiveness and its importance for life and conduct seem to me so great that i am not embarrassed to make it the exception to a general assumption of the determinism of mental phenomena secondly the moral issues also weigh deeply with me the morality of an ethic of intentions based on respect for personality seems to me so important and so well justified when understood that i could not abandon it i can understand as i have tried to indicate that a determinist could base a broadly similar morality on selfacceptance rather than indeterminism but still it would be in an important sense a new morality here the onus of proof is very relevant i do not feel at liberty to change my conception of man in such a fundamental respect unless the change is forced upon me for teachers to hide this material click on the normal link noesis stanford encyclopedia of philosophy wikipedia for scholars to hide

by the manufacturers that put such products on the market  a manufacturers and product sellers because the manufacturer is in the best position to discover dangerous product defects and determine how to correct such defects product liability actions for strict liability can be brought only against the manufacturer of a product in georgia an entity is classified as a manufacturer if  the entity actually designs or manufactures the product  the entity is a manufacturer of a component part that failed and caused injury to the plaintiff or  the entity is an assembler of component parts who then sells the assembled item as a single item under its own trade name  despite these seemingly broad definitions courts strictly construe the georgia strict liability statute  holding that it only applies to actual manufacturers those entities that have an active role in the production design or assembly of products and placing them in the stream of commerce  while manufacturers are subject to strict liability in georgia product sellers are specifically excluded from such liability pursuant to ocga section this statute defines a product seller as a person who leases or sells and distributes installs prepares blends packages labels markets or assembles pursuant to a manufacturer s plan intention design specifications or formulations or repairs maintains or otherwise is involved in placing a product in the stream of commerce  because an entity may simultaneously display the traits of a manufacturer and a product seller courts are often required to evaluate the undisputed evidence to determine whether the georgia strict liability statute applies in many instances the dispute is the subject of a motion for summary judgment in which the defendant argues that it is georgia law of

resqline s instructions and sent the cable to resqline so that it could be incorporated into the system sava did not participate in the integration of the cable assembly into the system  relying upon ocga section b the plaintiffs alleged that sava was strictly liable because it manufactured the defective cable and cable system that caused the plaintiff s injuries sava denied liability for the plaintiff s injuries arguing in its motion for summary judgment that it was merely a product seller and was not liable as a manufacturer on grounds of strict liability  the district court agreed with sava observing that sava simply assembled the cable pursuant to the plan intention design specifications and formulation of resqline  because sava did not manufacture the cable did not play an active role in the design or selection of the cable and did not participate in the integration of the cable assembly into the system  the court determined that sava was not the manufacturer of a defective

embry was operating a standup forklift that lacked a rear guard when embry s forklift made contact with a parked forklift the forks on the parked forklift entered the operator s compartment and fatally injured embry as a result the plaintiff asserted a strict liability claim against gregory poole equipment company alleging that the forklift embry was operating should have been equipped with a rear guard  the forklift embry was operating was designed and manufactured by material handling associates  mha  and caterpillar it was sold to embry s employer by gregory poole equipment company  gregory poole  because the general manager of gregory poole served on the advisory board of the mha design team for the forklift the plaintiff maintained that gregory poole also manufactured the product and was therefore liable under georgia s strict liability statute  the trial court disagreed with the plaintiff s argument and granted gregory poole s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff s strict liability claim  after reviewing the evidence submitted in support of gregory poole s motion the georgia court of appeals concluded that gregory poole could not be held strictly liable because it was merely a seller of a product manufactured by mha  in making this decision the court rejected the plaintiff s claim that gregory poole became a manufacturer simply because its

sustained when the vinyl retractable tape on a crowdcontrol barrier detached from a metal post and struck him on the arm the plaintiff s claims were based on theories of negligence and strict

tensabarrier crowdcontrol system according to lawrence metal the retractable tape cassettes used in the system were designed and manufactured by another company and lawrence metal merely produced the metal posts in which the cassettes were inserted the trial court granted lawrence metal s motion finding that lawrence metal could not be held liable on theories of negligence or strict liability because it was merely a seller of the product the trial court concluded that lawrence metal was not a manufacturer despite the fact that lawrence metal manufactured the metal posts and labeled marketed and sold the crowdcontrol system  the georgia court of appeals reevaluated the evidence and reversed the trial court s ruling  while the court of appeals recognized that lawrence metal did not have a role in the design or production of the retractable tape cassette the court concluded that lawrence metal had an active role in the production design and assembly of the overall system  the court was persuaded by the fact that the system consists of both the cassettes and the posts the system cannot function without the posts and the plaintiff alleged that the system and not just the

recall may be admissible to show that a defect was present when the product left the manufacturer it does not relieve a plaintiff from proving that the alleged defect proximately caused his or her injuries  strict liability is imposed for injuries which are the proximate result of product defects not for the manufacture of defective products unless the manufacturer s defective product can be shown to be the proximate cause of the injuries there can be no recovery  in cadwell v general motors corp  the plaintiff brought a product liability suit for injuries she sustained when she lost control of her  chevrolet blazer and struck a telephone pole the plaintiff claimed among other things that defects in the vehicle s braking system proximately caused her injuries and she sought damages under theories of strict liability and negligence although the plaintiff retained an expert to offer opinions regarding these alleged defects the district court excluded the expert s opinions because they did not meet the daubert standards for relevancy reliability and admissibility  without an expert to support her allegations the plaintiff relied solely upon evidence of the recall of a component found within the braking system of  chevrolet blazers  recognizing that the plaintiff had very little evidence to support her theories of liability general motors moved for summary judgment

warranted on these claims because the plaintiff failed to present evidence that her vehicle had any type of design defect or that any such defect was the proximate cause of her accident  ii failure to warn a general a manufacturer who has reason to anticipate that its product has the potential for doing harm when used for a particular purpose may be required to give adequate warning of the danger  the manufacturer s duty to warn depends upon a number of factors including the foreseeability of the use in question the type of danger involved and the foreseeability of the user s knowledge of the danger  if the manufacturer has a duty to warn the manufacturer may breach the duty by  failing to adequately warn of the product s potential risks or  failing to adequately communicate the warning to the user  failure to adequately communicate a warning generally requires an evaluation of the location and presentation of the warning including the color font size and use of symbols to draw attention to the warning  in addition to establishing a duty to warn and a breach on the part of the manufacturer the plaintiff must also establish that the breach proximately caused the plaintiff s injuries in cases premised upon the content or sufficiency of a warning the plaintiff s failure to actually read the instructions or warning may prevent the plaintiff from recovering id at  id at

powell v harsco corp  ga app    sed     mercer law review vol  however if the plaintiff contends that the manufacturer failed to adequately communicate the warning the plaintiff s failure to read a warning does not bar recovery  in fact in cases challenging the location and presentation of the warning the plaintiff s failure to read the warnings may actually be circumstantial evidence of the inadequacy of the warning  the georgia court of appeals recently examined the effect that a plaintiff s failure to read a warning can have on failure to warn claims in camden oil co v jackson  the plaintiff sued an oil company and a truck bed manufacturer for severe burns he sustained while filling a portable container with gasoline the plaintiff contended that the defendants failed to adequately warn him of the risks associated with filling a portable container with gasoline at a selfservice pump the record revealed that a warning located near the selfservice pump stated among other things portable containers must be placed on the ground prior to filling to avoid explosion or fire from static electricity  at the time the plaintiff sustained his injuries the portable container he was filling was sitting in the bed of his truck not on the ground  during his deposition the plaintiff acknowledged that he did not see or read this warning given this admission the oil company moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff s claim that  the content of the warning was inadequate and  the oil company s efforts to communicate the warning were inadequate  the trial court denied the defendant s motion and the oil company appealed  after reviewing the evidence the georgia court of appeals determined that summary judgment was warranted with respect to the plaintiff s contention that the warning posted next to the pump was inadequate  the court observed that a jury should not be allowed to consider the adequacy of the contents of the warning as a basis for imposing liability on the oil company when the plaintiff did not read the warning  because the plaintiff did not read the warning the court concluded that the warning  wilson foods  ga app at   sed at id ga app   sed    id at   sed at id at   sed at id at   sed at id at   sed at id at   sed at id at   sed at   product liability  could not possibly have been the proximate cause of his injuries  thus the court of appeals reversed this portion of the trial court s ruling  with respect to the plaintiff s remaining claims regarding the adequacy of the oil company s efforts to communicate the warning the court of appeals affirmed the trial court s denial of summary judgment  the court of appeals concluded that material issues of fact remained regarding whether the oil company adequately communicated the dangers involved with filling a portable container with gasoline  while the warning at issue was located on a column in full view of the customers at the gasoline pump the court determined that the jury must determine whether the manufacturer was negligent in failing to place a warning in such a position color and size print or to use symbols which would call the user s attention to the warning or cause the user to be more likely to read the label and warning than not  the court also rejected the oil company s assertion that the plaintiff s failure to read the warning constituted contributory negligence as a matter of law  according to the court if the jury could conclude that the oil company insufficiently communicated the warning regarding portable containers it could also conclude that the plaintiff did not fail to exercise ordinary care for his own safety when he did not notice and then read the posted warning  the northern district of georgia also had occasion to examine the sufficiency of a plaintiff s failure to warn claim during the survey period in wright v case corp  the plaintiff sustained serious injuries after he parked and prepared to exit a loader he was using to perform a landscaping job the plaintiff asserted that he raised the seat bar on the loader in an effort to engage the operator presence system a system that locks the controls of the operator s bucket and engages the parking brake as the plaintiff was sliding out of the loader the loader moved and the plaintiff was struck on the back of the head by a protective cage surrounding the loader the plaintiff filed suit alleging among other  id  sed at id  sed at id  id at   sed at id quoting battersby  ga app at   sed at   id at   sed at id at   sed at no cvjec  us dist lexis  nd ga feb    mercer law review vol  things that the manufacturer failed to warn of the dangers associated with the loader specifically that the loader could still move after the operator raised the seat bar  the manufacturer of the loader moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff s failure to warn claim asserting that the plaintiff could not support his claim because his expert had been excluded by the district court  the district court denied the manufacturer s motion observing that there was some evidence in the record to support the plaintiff s failure to warn claim even without the expert testimony  the court was persuaded by the fact that the both the instructional postings on the loader and the operator s manual stated that the parking brake is engaged when the seat bar is raised  thus it is a question of fact whether the ordinary operator should have appreciated the danger that the loader was subject to move when the seat bar was raised  b duties of entities other than manufacturers manufacturers are not the only entities subject to failure to warn claims product sellers for instance may have a duty to warn of dangers when the seller knows or should know the particular use of the product and risks from such use  however the product seller s duty is generally limited to those circumstances in which the seller is aware of a danger either not communicated by the manufacturer s warning or substantively different from the dangers the manufacturer has included in a warning label  similarly a product seller generally does not have a duty to discover hidden defects in a product however if the seller inspects or tests its product it has assumed a duty to exercise ordinary care in making its investigation and can be liable if it negligently fails to

injuries robyn embry sustained while operating a forklift that was distributed and sold by gregory poole the plaintiffs filed strict liability and negligence claims against gregory poole asserting among other things that gregory poole was aware of the rear guard knew it was a desirable safety device and breached its duty to warn its customers of the dangers associated with operating the forklift without it because the manufacturer of the forklift did not provide any warning labels or warnings regarding the danger of other forklifts entering the operator s compartment the plaintiffs asserted that gregory poole should have warned the purchaser about the forklift and described optional safety equipment additionally the plaintiffs maintained that gregory poole had investigated the product s expected use and advised embry s employer ecolab regarding the type of equipment and safety devices that should be used in its business because ecolab relied upon the superior knowledge of gregory poole the plaintiffs maintained that gregory poole also assumed a duty to warn ecolab of any patent defects with the product finally the plaintiff contended that gregory poole may have intentionally withheld information regarding the rearguard door in an effort to avoid potential failure to warn claims resulting from similar accidents  to support these allegations the plaintiffs provided evidence that gregory poole made an extensive investigation of the forklift in  nearly four years before embry was killed while operating the forklift the plaintiffs also submitted evidence that ecolab requested information from gregory poole regarding the safety of the forklift as early as  soon after another ecolab employee was injured on the forklift  despite this evidence the trial court granted gregory poole s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs failure to warn claims  the georgia court of appeals reversed the trial court s ruling observing that the independent investigation and inquiry by gregory poole created a jury question regarding whether gregory poole had a duty to advise of the existence of the rearguard door and the risk of not using the guard ga

of appeals in chamblin v kmart corp  recently determined that a pharmacist does not have a heightened duty to warn consumers of every possible side effect of a drug  there the plaintiff filled a prescription at a pharmacy in the defendant s store according to the plaintiff the pharmacist did not provide warnings as to potential side effects of the drug and the plaintiff thereafter suffered an extremely rare allergic reaction the plaintiff filed suit against the store alleging that the failure to warn of potential side effects of the drug was a violation of the standard of care for pharmacists the plaintiff asserted that the store had a duty to warn her of all potential side effects based upon regulations of the georgia state board of pharmacy which require pharmacists to counsel patients about their medication the trial court disagreed with the plaintiff s assertion and granted the defendant s motion for summary judgment on this claim  the georgia court of appeals affirmed the trial court s ruling determining that the plaintiff had not established that the store had a heightened duty to warn of potential side effects  while the regulations of the board of pharmacy require pharmacists to offer counseling to their customers the court observed that the topics are determined by the pharmacists and may include common side or adverse effects  as a result the court determined that the regulations do not impose a duty on a pharmacist to identify every remote possible side effect such as the rare allergic reaction that the plaintiff suffered  in talton v arnall golden gregory llp  the georgia court of appeals examined whether a legally cognizable duty can be established when there is absolutely no privity between the plaintiff and the defendant  in

alleged that agg negligently recommended and prepared an inadequate warning label for the cadaver tissue with knowledge that third parties would ultimately rely upon the information contained in the label  agg filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff s failure to warn claim asserting among other things that  it had no duty as a matter of law to warn nonclients of the risks associated with the tissue  it could not control whether its client actually relied upon their advice  it could not control the information their client ultimately included in the warning  the plaintiff never had the opportunity to review or rely upon the warning label and  the plaintiff s physician was responsible for informing plaintiff of the risks of using the cadaver tissue  the trial court granted agg s motion and the plaintiff appealed  the georgia court of appeals affirmed the trial court s ruling rejecting the three different theories the plaintiff offered to support his claim that agg had a duty to warn of the risks associated with the cryolife cadaver tissue  first the court rejected the plaintiff s assertion that agg s duty to warn was premised upon the fact that it was reasonably foreseeable that third parties would rely upon the information agg provided during the course of its representation of cryolife  the court of appeals rejected this theory outright determining that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that agg ever intended for its advice to be disclosed to or relied upon by third parties  the court observed that the information agg provided to cryolife was confidential and intended solely for the consideration and use by cryolife  the court further observed that agg had no control over whether cryolife actually followed its advice  the court also rejected the plaintiff s claim that agg owed a duty to him under section a of the restatement of torts which addresses  id at   sed at id at   sed at id  id at   sed at id at   sed at id at   sed at

that the handful of cases upon which the plaintiff relied were distinguishable because there was absolutely no evidence that agg participated in the procurement processing or distribution of the infected tissue  finally the court rejected the plaintiff s assertion that the court should find that a duty existed based upon public policy  according to the plaintiff public policy demands that an attorney be held accountable when the attorney gives confidential advice to a client and the client later acts in a manner that harms a third party regardless of whether the client s actions were consistent with the attorney s advice  the court declined to adopt such a rule because it would expose attorneys to potentially unlimited liability to third persons who were never their clients and who had no basis upon which to reasonably rely on the attorneys confidential advice to their clients  iii proximate cause proof that a manufacturer s product proximately caused the plaintiff s injuries is an essential element of all product liability claims whether the plaintiff is proceeding under a strict liability or negligence theory  without a showing of proximate cause there can be no recovery  liability is imposed for injuries that proximately result from the use of a defective product not for the mere manufacture of a defective product  trial courts often struggle to define proximate cause particularly when instructing a jury the georgia court of appeals has described this dilemma as follows although many legal scholars have attempted to lay down a single standard to determine proximate causation no satisfactory universal formula has emerged instead proximate cause is always to  id at   sed at id  id  id  id at   sed at see eg ocga b  steinberg v sica spa no cv hl

considerations of logic common sense justice policy and precedent the best use that can be made of the authorities on proximate cause is merely to furnish illustrations of situations which judicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the line or the other  although the concept of proximate cause eludes precise definition a wellestablished principle of georgia law provides that in cases involving the negligence of multiple tortfeasors the negligence of each tortfeasor must be a contributing factor in the plaintiff s injury to be considered a proximate cause of it where the injury is the result of the concurring negligence of two or more parties they may be sued jointly or severally all may be sued jointly notwithstanding different degrees of care may be owed by the different defendants it is well settled that an action may be maintained against two joint tortfeasors whose negligence contributes to produce an injury even though the same obligations do not rest upon each with respect to the person injured it is sufficient to support a recovery if the negligence of both be a contributing cause even though one owes to the person injured a higher degree of care and even though there be differing degrees of negligence by each  because as this principle recognizes there may be more than one proximate cause of an injury the term proximate cause is not synonymous with the term dominant cause  during the survey period the georgia supreme court again considered the definition of proximate cause in john crane inc v jones  the plaintiff s decedent filed a complaint against several manufacturers of asbestos products alleging that he contracted mesothelioma because of occupational exposure to asbestos dust from their products after the decedent died the following year the plaintiff amended the complaint to add claims for wrongful death and loss of consortium all the defendants except john crane either were dismissed or filed for bankruptcy  john crane inc v jones  ga app    sed    quoting atlanta obstetrics  gynecology group pa v coleman  ga    sed    gooch v georgia marble co  ga    se    internal quotation marks omitted thompson v thompson  ga    sed   ga   sed    mercer law review vol  prior to trial  the plaintiff and john crane proceeded to trial and the trial court instructed the jury as follows with respect to proximate cause proximate cause requires a showing by the plaintiff that the defendant s negligence was a factor in bringing about the loss where several negligent acts may have produced plaintiff s injury to be considered the proximate cause an individual defendant s tortious conduct must constitute a contributing factor in bringing about the plaintiff s damages now to hold an individual defendant liable the plaintiff must introduce sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that more than likely their exposure to a particular defendant s product was a factor in producing their injuries  john crane agreed with this instruction except for the omission of the word substantial before contributing factor  the jury returned a verdict against john crane for  the trial court denied john crane s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial and john crane appealed to the georgia court of appeals  the court of appeals affirmed  the georgia supreme court framed the issue on which it granted certiorari as follows where separate tortious acts allegedly committed by multiple defendants may have combined to produce the plaintiff s injury must each individual tortfeasor s conduct constitute a substantial contributing factor in the injury in order to be considered a proximate cause thereof  john crane argued that the trial court and the court of appeals erred because the substantial factor formulation is consistent with georgia law has been widely accepted throughout the country and is justified by public policy considerations  the supreme court held each of these arguments to be unavailing  first requiring a tortfeasor s contribution to the plaintiff s injury to be substantial would be contrary to not consistent with longstanding  id

concurrent negligence among multiple tortfeasors there has never been a requirement that any single tortfeasor s negligence substantially contribute to the plaintiff s injury before liability will be found  second although some jurisdictions have adopted the substantial factor formulation of proximate cause at least in asbestos cases there are very real problems with that standard such as the difficulty in defining the term substantial factor and the danger that it will become a separate and independent hurdle that the plaintiff will have to overcome in addition to the standard elements of a claim of negligence  finally john crane s public policy argument was that refusing to embrace the substantial contributing factor formulation will subject every defendant in asbestos actions to joint and several liability for injuries caused by others conduct and will encourage an increase in asbestos cases thus creating administrative problems for the judicial system  the supreme court dismissed john crane s concerns noting that asbestos litigation is not new and the absence of a substantial contributing factor formulation has not led to the proliferation of such lawsuits nor is it likely to do so especially in light of the requirement that an asbestos plaintiff must prove that he or she was exposed to the defendant s asbestoscontaining product  accordingly the supreme court answered the question on which it granted certiorari in the negative and therefore affirmed the decision of the court of appeals  iv evidentiary issues a expert testimony on february   georgia governor sonny perdue signed into law senate bill  a package of tort reform legislation that dramatically altered the admissibility standard for expert witness testimony in civil  id id id at   sed at id  sed at id id at   sed at   mercer law review vol  cases in georgia state courts  the new statute adopts the admissibility criteria from daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc  and its progeny general electric v joiner  and kumho tire co ltd v carmichael   through the following subsection if scientific technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact in any cause of action to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge skill experience training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise if  the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data which are or will be admitted into evidence at the hearing or trial  the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and  the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case  the code section reinforces the adoption of daubert by explicitly allowing georgia courts to seek guidance from the decisions of the united states supreme court in daubert joiner kumho tire and other federal court interpretations of these decisions  in the first georgia appellate court review of this new evidentiary standard moran v kia motors america inc  the georgia court of appeals affirmed the exclusion of testimony from the plaintiff s expert witness regarding the diminished value of the plaintiff s car  the plaintiff in this case claimed that the windows in her new car did not operate correctly when she drove the car home on the date of purchase moran complained about additional problems with the windows a total of four times in the next six months and eventually filed a breach of warranty claim against kia at trial she offered testimony from an expert witness to prove the diminished value of her car the expert who had never inspected the car used repair records kelley s blue book and a formula that he had derived to calculate the diminished value of the  ga sb   reg

the court of appeals affirmed the exclusion of this testimony holding that there was no evidence that the methodology of the plaintiff s expert witness  was widely used in the automotive field  had a known rate of error or  had been subject to any peer review  what impact does the adoption of the daubert standard have on lawsuits in georgia state courts this same expert had been permitted to offer similar testimony in the previous trial of the same matter that had taken place before the georgia legislature adopted the daubert standard  on retrial with the new evidentiary standard the expert witness was excluded and the defendant was granted a directed verdict which was later affirmed on appeal  it is important to note that the court of appeals was assessing whether the daubert standard was appropriately applied to the testimony of the plaintiff s expert witness not whether any constitutional provision invalidated the application of the daubert principles  given the relative zeal with which tort reform issues have been litigated at the trial court level it is only a matter of time before additional appellate decisions will offer perspective on this new evidentiary standard in georgia state courts because ocga section permits the trial courts to use federal court decisions for guidance in their daubert analyses it is important for georgia practitioners to stay abreast of daubert opinions from federal courts  three opinions from georgia federal district courts within the survey period show how exacting the daubert standard can be id at   sed at id at   sed at  ocga b

vol  one recent decision cadwell v general motors corp  involved testimony from a gmtrained mechanic who opined that an air bag system should have deployed in a single vehicle accident involving a chevrolet blazer in response to the daubert challenge the plaintiff contended that the experience of the mechanic in the automotive repair field and the certification from his gm training were sufficient to opine whether the air bag should have deployed  but the trial court found that the expert met none of the daubert criteria  the expert could not answer engineering and design questions regarding the air bag system nor could he answer questions regarding the injuries sustained by the plaintiff  the trial court concluded that the expert witness did not understand the relevant physics principles had never reviewed any literature on air bag systems had not performed any diagnostic testing of the subject vehicle did not know how air bag sensors work did not know how to interpret data from the air bag computer had never been an expert witness before and had no medical training  because the expert had only general opinions and no specific expert knowledge in the area of air bag system engineering the trial court excluded his testimony  in wright v case corp  the defendant moved pursuant to rule and daubert to exclude the testimony of the plaintiff s expert witness who offered testimony that the loader used by the plaintiff was defective the plaintiff responded that this witness was qualified because the expert was a licensed mechanical engineer  but the trial court disagreed  because the expert lacked knowledge regarding the type of loader at issue for example he was not familiar with the mechanics of the loader until he was retained in this lawsuit his

conclusions  the witness had performed no testing of his alternative designs was unaware of any literature that discussed the merits of his alternative designs and could not identify any other models that incorporated his alternative designs  the witness admitted that he merely was providing concepts regarding how the loader could be improved  but the trial court emphasized that daubert s reliability prong requires more than conceptualizing possibilities  because the testimony of the expert witness did not satisfy the daubert criteria the court excluded the testimony  treating physicians also must comply with the requirements of daubert before offering opinion testimony in leathers v pfizer inc  the trial court excluded the testimony of a treating physician who had been
