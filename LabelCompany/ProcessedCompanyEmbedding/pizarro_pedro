my mom is a total extrovert if she joined us now you’d be lucky to get a word in but they’re both very caring and my approach is colored by themi do think i have personal relationships with my team at the same time there’s a role i have to play you can have a strong relationship with somebody but you also need to be ready to be candid and give feedbackand it’s a twoway street i say to my team that they need to be ready to call me on something and that requires a level of trust because there are times when i’m flatout wrongit takes some really confident comfortable people to not shut down the moment that i signal that i might disagree with them one thing i do with some of my closest partners at work is to tell them that they should sometimes really disagree with me — genuinely of course — in open settings so people see that somebody whom i value can debate with me advertisement continue reading the main story you can talk all you want about trust and disagreement but unless you provide concrete examples of it in action it’s kind of flat human beings are incredibly perceptive and they seem to be more perceptive when they look at people above them than when they look downso when you went to college did you have a clear idea of what you wanted to do for a careeri wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon because of my experience with my back i chose chemistry and physics as my majors and became more interested in the science side i then spent about six years working on a phd before deciding to make a big shift to go work at mckinsey newsletter sign up continue reading the main story

from the rest of us once we reached a conclusion we would move on but this one person on the team tended to the leave the question open longeras a manager it frustrated the heck out of me for a while and we did have some team discussions about it but the lesson for me was that the guy actually saved our bacon a couple of times because we had reached conclusions that were offand even though we felt he was a pain he made us look at the question again it was a great lesson about diversity of viewpoints we all had to adapt to each otherother lessonsi see a lot of leaders who want to be the hub with their people as the spokes bringing them information my visual for leadership is that if the team is a wheel i’m actually the rim i’m not the centermy job is to keep the spokes together keep the team together and really help that team perform because they collectively are going to have a lot more insights than i will it also means that when you have to go through mud the rim goes in first but that’s the way it should behow do you hireyou need smarts because there’s just no substitute for smarts you need folks who are going to be able to lead teams in a way that makes teams want to follow them there has to be some chemistry as well given the time all of us spend together at worki really like hearing from people about a time they failed and what they learned from it and i try to get some genuine answers to that question that shows humilityi also really believe in hiring the person who might not necessarily do the best job in the role next monday instead i look for the person who could do the job the best a year from now and who might be able to go beyond the job to the next level it’s about hiring for immediate skill versus hiring for potential there’s a balance there advertisement continue reading the main story one of the pieces of advice i often give to people early in their career is that they should have a general direction and aspiration for two or three potential senior jobs and then always be working on a few things to improve themselves in the end life will surprise you but working on those skills will help you get there continue reading the main
