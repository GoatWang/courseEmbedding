while we don’t typically engage in motivational speeches if that’s something you’d like we can certainly oblige endurance there’s another marathon scenario that bears comparison going out too fast many a runner has suffered later in the race because they were so excited at the beginning they didn’t stick to their training pace started too fast and paid the price later we are firm believers in keeping an eye on the finish line sticking with our strategy and not getting caught up in the excitement of the latest buysell craze this strategy has worked well time and again for those clients who are committed to maintaining a winning pace goals the reason most people run a marathon is because it’s a goal they wish to achieve but the only way to cross the finish line is to marry that goal with

run when it comes to investing and safeguarding your future woodley farra manion portfolio management embraces the “it’s not a sprint it’s a marathon” philosophy rather than focusing on short flashy bursts and a quick finish we patiently plot your course prepare for the long run and help you cross a finish line that in essence you’ve trained for your entire life watch our video to see how our approach really is different »   research a marathon runner would never invest in a pair of shoes that wasn’t right for their needs they’d research them ask experts for advice try them on and assess the fit we are constantly researching and analyzing thousands of stocks narrowing down the best choices at the right time when you come in to talk with us we’ll be ready to find the best fit for you coaching we believe in the power of good coaching so much so that we don’t provide you with just one coach — your investments are reviewed by our entire team that’s years upon years of experience expertise and sound thinking working on your behalf and while we don’t typically engage in motivational speeches if that’s something you’d like we can certainly oblige endurance there’s another marathon scenario that bears comparison going out too fast many a runner has suffered later in the race because they were so excited at the beginning they didn’t stick to their training pace started too fast and paid the price later we are firm believers in keeping an eye on the finish line sticking with our strategy and not getting caught up in the excitement of the latest buysell craze this strategy has worked well time and again for those clients who are committed to maintaining a winning pace goals the reason most people run a marathon is because it’s a goal they wish to achieve but the only way to cross the finish line is to marry that goal with a sound strategy when you come in to woodley farra the first thing we do is get to know you and your goals then utilizing one of our
