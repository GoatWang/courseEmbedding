seeks partners to boost mexico refinery logistics margins  ajotcom login × log in email password remember me on this device forgot password cancel join ajot stay informed follow us on pemex seeks partners to boost mexico refinery logistics margins by reuters  jan   at  pm mexico city  mexican stateowned oil company pemex is seeking private partners to improve margins at its refineries and logistical services a top company executive said on wednesday alejandro martinez head of the newly created industrial transformation division which groups together much of the company’s activities beyond exploration and production of crude oil said pemex is evaluating the monetization of existing assets by selling them and then leasing them back pemex like all oil companies is grappling with a severe cash crunch due to a more than  percent decline in crude prices since  speaking at an energy forum martinez specifically pointed to projects covering waste water treatment hydrogen supply nitrogen separation and crude conditioning as areas in which the company will seek out new private partners “in the past pemex would do all of these activities but today there’s an opportunity for private mexican or international companies to participate” martinez said the executive also cited other logistical sale and leaseback areas such as pemex’s oil and other multiuse pipelines as well as its processing terminals he did not specify how soon companies would be able to bid on the partnerships or which projects would be first in line “we have competitors practically at our doorstep” martinez said referring to the implementation of a sweeping energy reform in mexico finalized in  that ended pemex’s decadeslong monopoly on a wide range of oil sector activities martinez added that pemex will only take a minority stake in its new cogeneration power generation plants “as a sign to the market that we are opening up” and that the company has the next two years to cement the new partnerships in  mexico’s retail fuel sector will be fully open to refined product imports from private or foreign companies and will no longer feature governmentset prices reuters httpwwwreuterscom

access to pemexs oil logistics systems including pipelines and terminals early next year mexicos comision reguladora de energia cre has approved the proposal of procedure of open season to pemex logistica as well as the terms and conditions for the service of storage and transportation by pipelines cre said the open season which allows thirdparty shippers to ship and store products on pemexs logistics system will increase efficiency in the mexican oil industry and provide greater certainty to importers and marketers the opening of pemexs midstream system to thirdparty shippers is in line with the legal provisions established by mexican energy reforms opis notes that pemex pipelines and storage systems are currently closed to third parties pemex continues to have the monopoly of the mexican oil products market despite an import liberalization earlier this year the slow import flow by private companies so far this year is blamed on logistics constraints and fuel specifications issues mexico is one of the largest us oil products export destinations in terms of volumes and this northsouth flow has increased in the past year due to nagging mexican refinery issues while an opening for pemex pipelines and terminals to third parties should increase private fuel imports in february opis notes that cre will continue to control the prices in the northern region of mexico during the first four months of  a price control may not offer much price discovery for third parties planning to import fuel into mexico but after april fuel prices in northern mexico will be allowed to float without cre intervention the opening of pemex systems will be implemented in two phases in the first phase pemex will make available about  bd of pipeline capacity and around  bbl in storage capacity in northern mexico in accordance with the schedule of gasoline and diesel price flexibility to be established by cre the open seasons will be carried out by region the first will be in the northern zone of the country and will include storage terminals and pipeline systems in the border states of baja california sonora chihuahua coahuila nuevo leon and tamaulipas opis notes that the first phase could allow independent importers in mexico to buy fuel from rack terminals in california arizona and new mexico for delivery on the pemex system the second phase would expand us rack optionality for northern mexico retailers and distributors to texas including brownsville and el paso the first phase of the pemex logistics open season will begin feb  and will end on april  with storage and pipeline infrastructure in baja california sonora chihuahua coahuila nuevo leon and tamaulipas the first phase will cover storage terminals in rosarito mexicali and ensenada in baja california terminals link to the rosarito pipeline transportation system the first phase will also cover terminals in nogales magdalena hermosillo guaymas ciudad obregon and navojoa as well as terminals linked to the guaymas pipeline transportation system cre will launch an electronic platform to offer technical operational and financial information and data on pemex logistica and this is made available to interested third parties cre said cre will also find a prequalification format for interested parties and an auction platform to receive the shipping and storage proposals in the current context of the free importation of petroleum products and the acceleration of the floating price mechanism or price liberalization for gasoline and diesel under market conditions these procedures provide the basis for open and not unduly discriminatory access to the infrastructure of transport by pipeline and storage property of pemex the second phase will kick off april  thirdparty independent players will have access to terminals in ciudad juarez chihuahua parral gomez palacio sabinas monclova saltillo nuevo laredo santa catarina cadereyta ciudad mante reynosa ciudad victoria
