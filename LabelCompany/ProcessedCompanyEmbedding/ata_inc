if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses payable by us as of the date of this prospectus we anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering as follows • approximately  million to develop and expand our test preparation solutions business • approximately  million to license course content from it vendors to expand our degree major and single course program offerings • approximately  million for marketing costs related to enhancing our “ata” brand and • the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes including incremental costs associated with being a public company and for acquisitions of or investments in other businesses products or technologies that we believe are complementary to our own business or that otherwise extend our business or brand we do not currently have any agreements or understandings to make any material acquisitions of or investments in other businesses the industries in which we operate are evolving rapidly which could cause significant and rapid changes to our strategies and business plans the foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and allocation of the net proceeds from this offering based upon our present plans and business conditions but our management will have broad flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds from this offering the occurrence of new business opportunities unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of the proceeds from this offering in a manner other than as described in this prospectus to the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from this offering are

could result in negative tax consequences to you in relation to computerbased testing services we compete with domestic chinese testing software providers and international computerbased testing service providers prometric and pearson vue are our main competitors in china we compete with them primarily based on technology price management experience and established infrastructure we believe our overall testing services and technologies compare favorably with the services and technologies offered by these competitors moreover we believe that our nationwide test center network and test delivery platform provides us with a significant competitive advantage over these two competitors we believe we are currently the market leader in computerbased testing services in china due to the combination of our experience in and familiarity with the china computerbased testing services market our advanced technology our large nationwide network of test centers our established relationships with key test sponsors and governmental agencies and our competitive cost levels in relation to our careeroriented educational services we face competition from international companies such as aptech limited and niit limited aptech limited operates in china primarily through its joint venture with beida jade bird although these two companies offer itrelated courses to postsecondary educational institutions in china based on our market experience and client communications we believe they do not directly compete with our products and services for example these two companies design their own course content and exams and provide passing students with their own proprietary certifications rather than offering course content and certifications designed by wellknown it vendors as we do other than the joint venture between aptech limited and beida jade bird we are not aware of any domestic chinese company that offers educational services similar to or competitive with our careeroriented educational services as a result we have to date experienced little pricing pressure due to competition although we do feel some pressure to maintain a pricing level for our educational services that is affordable for vocational schools that ultimately need to pass such costs on to students in the form of tuition and course fees this may prevent us from raising prices for our education services significantly in the short term traditional chinese test preparation material providers such as publishing companies indirectly compete with our test preparation solutions however we are not aware of any significant competitors in china in the online test preparation solutions business in relation to our simulation technologies there are a few usbased companies providing performancebased testing technologies including certiport inc we are aware of only a handful of other simulation testing technology developers which primarily focus on the training and test preparation business market in the united states we believe based on communications with our clients and others in the industry that our simulation testing technology compares favorably to those offered by other companies and in other countries including the united states while we anticipate new market entrants and increased efforts by existing international players to expand their presence in china we believe that relatively high entry barriers such as the time and costs associated with establishing a largescale test center network and developing course and test content for educational programs will make it difficult for new entrants or international competitors to quickly gain market share from us in china we believe potential domestic entrants lack the technology and commercial relationships that we have already developed with domestic and international test sponsors international competitors will likely face challenges in establishing effective relationships with key chinese government and industry test sponsors or local educational institutions company description we are the leading provider of computerbased testing services in china with the largest market share  in terms of revenue in  according to idc we also provide careeroriented testbased educational programs and test preparation solutions to comply with prc law we operate the online portion of our test preparation solutions business through a series of contractual arrangements with ata online beijing education technology limited or ata online a prc entity owned by two of our founders and over which we do not have direct control or direct oversight we have experienced significant growth in our business during the fiscal year ended march   our total net revenues have increased from rmb million for the fiscal year ended march   to rmb million  million for the fiscal year ended march   and from rmb million for the six months ended september   to rmb million  million for the six months ended september   we had net losses of rmb million and rmb million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively and net income of rmb million  million for the six months ended september   we started our business in  focusing on providing computerbased testing services to test sponsors our revenues from the licensing of testing services which we provide to test sponsors have grown primarily as a result of increases in the number of test takers who take tests created and delivered using our testing technologies as well as our ability to secure increasing numbers of new contracts from test sponsors for the creation and delivery of new computerbased test titles testing services revenues accounted for  and  of our total net revenues for the six months ended september   and  respectively in the near term we expect our testing services revenues to continue to be the largest source of our total net revenues as a result of new contracts with test sponsors in the banking securities and insurance sectors our testing services are also important for reasons other than the revenues they generate the expertise we have developed in the creation and delivery of large scale tests covering a wide variety of test topics
