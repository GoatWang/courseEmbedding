instructions base clean with a soft dry or slightly damp cloth dry thoroughly avoid harsh cleaners including ammoniabased glass cleaners and abrasives as they will damage the finish fabric brush or vacuum regularly use a nonmetallic stiffbristle brush protect from direct sunlight to prevent fading dab spills immediately with a soft white cloth dampened with distilled water not tap water test fabric cleaners first in an inconspicuous area do not saturate fabric with cleaner pat instead of rub to avoid altering texture clean stain from outer edge to prevent “circling” thorough cleaning is recommended every  to  months do not wait for severe soiling we recommend a professional inhome upholstery cleaning service do not remove cushion casings for cleaning unlike slipcovers upholstered casings are not meant to be removed leather never use detergents polishes preservers or saddle soap they can remove natural oils dust or vacuum for routine maintenance do not place in direct sunlight it will lighten or discolor leather over time dab spills immediately with a soft white cloth dampened in distilled water not tap water if spill penetrates leather use lukewarm distilled water and a soft white cloth to massage stain and surrounding area blot with a dry cloth and allow leather to air dry most surface scratches will fade over time if you rub them with your fingertips friction and heat from rubbing helps to redistribute wax in surrounding areas to cover the scratch not all scratches have the same depth and this may not work on deeper scratches composition  construction our leather upholstered products are constructed from aniline leather only the top  of hides can be made into aniline leather making it the finest available the fullgrain or topgrain leathers are soaked in transparent nontoxic dye with no subsequent pigmented finish coats applied dye penetrates the hides letting the natural grain show through our ivory leather white pebbled leather and white faux ostrich are exceptions to this process they are semianiline dyed with a layer of pigment applied afterwards anilines have natural markings that vary from hide to hide they also have color variations due to the leather’s ability to accept dyes differently in various areas of a hide markings and shading distinguish genuine leather from manmade materials appreciating shade differences among hides also means appreciating them on individual furniture pieces because no two pieces can be produced from a single hide our leathers appeal to customers who find the natural color variations markings and patina of pure aniline leathers unique and beautiful they may not appeal to customers who want uniform color and surface commonly seen on less expensive leathers that are heavily corrected and pigmented shipping shipping information all custom upholstery items will be shipped directly from the manufacturer and are not eligible for rush shipping please allow  to  weeks for delivery item
