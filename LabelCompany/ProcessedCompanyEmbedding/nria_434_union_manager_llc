news client login  union street carroll gardens brooklyn annualized return monthsinvestment term accredited investors have the opportunity to invest and receive a  annualized net return paid monthly in a preferred equity position guaranteed by the sponsor the investment is senior to the sponsor’s equity but junior to first lien construction debt which is also guaranteed by the sponsor andor borrowing entity investors will receive  of principal and their targeted  net return before the sponsor participates in sale proceeds national realty investment advisors “nria”  “sponsor” invites accredited investors to participate in the shortterm acquisition complete renovation and conversion of a fourunit multifamily property the “property” into a boutique threeunit highend condominium development located in the carroll gardens neighborhood of brooklyn ny the property is currently under contract and will be nria’s eighth brooklyn development of similar size  scope since midq  the property is more specifically located between bond  hoyt just ≈miles south of manhattan ≈miles from the brooklyn bridge and also within a shortwalking distance to numerous subway lines making for an easy commute anywhere in nyc upon acquisition nria has devised a month development plan that may be extended to a maximum of months but also may be accelerated that includes a complete renovation to efficiently maximize  modernize the usable square footage at the property the renovation period will be followed by an estimated month marketing process completed by marketing partner compass whereby the finished condominium units proposed plans  union street have been conservatively estimated to command ≈psf on average based on a current sales comparison analysis comps currently average ≈psf unique risk  reward investment profile in a world where all investors remain challenged to produce any yield to speak of and with many global economists believing we are returning to normal – away from relatively high interest rates and the resultant higher yields on bonds and other investment types for years to come it seems logical prudent investors will shift investment interests to alternatives such as real estate located in core urban markets managed by superior sponsorship the steady flow of income creates a natural hedge against unanticipated inflation without sacrificing expected return the subject investment is defined as a short duration tomonth highyield investment – offering a  net return paid monthly this current pay structure compensates investors immediately and throughout the development process with an additional illiquidity premium generally reserved for longerterm investment profiles moreover our constructive view on the market should help our investment partners continually generate excess returns over the longer term horizon equity cushion upon exit and additional sponsor credit enhancements nria conservatively estimated total gross and net sales proceeds of  million and  million respectively implying an ascompleted price psf of  average or a very healthy ≈ margin over total project costs after returning all principal moreover our sellout value estimate is considerably lower than the average comparable sale in the market of psf as well as a third party appraisal estimate of psf which if either were achieved would result in margins of ≈ and ≈ respectively there clearly remains a substantial equity cushion vs the breakeven price psf or where the nria buyback price is set see below “ii” it is this equity cushion that insures against a certain margin of error with the sponsor eligible for profits only after sellout in addition to the above nria has made other significant credit enhancements available to the investors through ithe borrowing entity union street capital  llc and flowing through to the managing member entity nria  union manager llc executing recourse to standard lender carveouts andor completion guarantees in addition to the completion guarantee provided by the general contractor this structure is intended to mitigate and distribute any perceived risk associated with growing contingent liabilities due to the current ongoing negotiations with the construction lenders there also may be an element of crosscollateralization with the underlying property and a similar nria sponsored loan maximum of two properties the final structure will be detailed in the operating agreement however nria anticipated these structural nuances and enhanced the investors position further through … iithe nria buyback agreement putoption whereby nria will acquire and pay investors for any unsold finished units at the end of the investment term in an amount “breakeven price” guaranteed to return all investor capital in the unlikely event the targeted sellout price points were not met the investment stability  low correlation of the nyc housing market vs other markets broader sp andor reit volatility etc see further information clearly make this an ideal longerterm rental investment for one of nria’s many highnetworth partners utilizing their pledged asset loan option further information available upon request iiithe nria fixed cost agreement which requires the gc to cover all cost overruns during the duration of the project and eliminates the need for additional investor capital calls ultimately these structural features further illustrate nria’s ability to execute and speak to how high we rank capital preservation cost efficiency  fixed cost construction contract nria’s proprietary construction bidding process volume of purchasing and history with a coreteam of development partners contractors architects engineers building suppliers etc have effectively created certain economies of scale as it relates to overall project costs furthermore with over  of nria’s completed projects being with our core gc us construction inc and within budget both parties feel very comfortable executing a fixed cost contract on all new projects whereby the gc covers all cost overruns during the duration of the project eliminating potential delays due solely to cost disputes etc construction costs are estimated at ≈psf at  union street with finishes at an appraised quality standard of “q” exceptional highend custom build please note these figures are far less than quotes given by “retail” contractors as high as ≈psf   the property is located in a prime urban growing area of brooklyn nyc’s largest and fastest growing borough population growth   –  brooklyn has over  million residents and if it was defined as its own city it would be the th largest in the us the property is more specifically located within the carroll gardens neighborhood of brooklyn bordering the newly created waterfront esplanade park along the gowanus canal where significant new luxury rental development is being completed the neighborhood is just  – miles from manhattan and centrally located within walking distance to public transportation see property map brooklyn has emerged as an incubator for technology advertising media design and innovation which is shown through the i ≈ increase in patent filings in brooklyn over the last years alone and ii the number of adults with advanced degrees moving to brooklyn tripling from  to  population  job growth shortage of new “affordable” supply continued household formation lack of developable air rights in the neighborhood and interest rates remaining low for the foreseeable future are all important underlying fundamentals that should continue to drive robust growth for many years to come market “charming suburban utopia”  union street is located along a treelined block in carroll gardens brooklyn between

washington llc west virginia llc wisconsin llc wyoming llc home  articles  how limited is limited liability how limited is limited liability one of the key advantages of a limited liability company llc over a sole proprietorship or general partnership is the fact that the owners members of the llc are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business normally that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier lender landlord or other creditor that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the llc the members may lose their entire investment in the business but their other assets  car home and personal bank accounts  are safe from the creditors of the business or are they in truth there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability many llc members will find that due to the way the business was operated the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful how personal liability arises a member of an llc can be held personally liable for many different types of claims but they typically arise under four different scenarios claims arising out of an act or omission by the member such as the members own negligence fraud or illegal act claims arising out of a contract particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member claims based on the concept of piercing the veil of the llc liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the llcs operating agreement or the applicable llc statute these claims are not a result of choosing an llc as a form of entity all of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and in fact the exceptions were developed first under corporate law actions of a member every member who actively participates in the business of the llc runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability this is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service if you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone your llc is not going to protect you similarly if you make promises about your product or service that are not true the first claim may be against the llc for breach of contract but if the llc cannot perform or pay damages the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action even if you have an employee who committed the action you may not be out of the woods if you personally hired the employee the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee a special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an llc is failure to pay payroll taxes to the irs to protect these socalled trust fund taxes any person who had the ability to prevent the nonpayment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes the irs applies this provision broadly so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didnt you are probably liable claims based on contract another and probably more common source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability usually by means of a personal guarantee for many small businesses particularly new businesses with no credit history obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible landlords too often insist on a personal guarantee particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as buildouts that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit especially after the business is up and running getting payment terms out of the gate however often requires a personal guarantee even when the creditor isnt seeking a personal guarantee a member of the llc can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role if she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the llc it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the llc full name and should indicate the role of the person who is signing member or manager piercing the veil of the llc even if a member avoids personal guarantees he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as piercing the corporate veil although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice in almost all cases of piercing the veil there is either commingling or diversion of assets some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include inadequate capitalization failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities nonpayment of dividends insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time nonfunctioning of other officers or directors absence of corporate records commingling of funds diversion of assets failure to maintain arms length relationships among related entities whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders a possible benefit of an llc over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities and absence of corporate records have no real counterparts in an llc however as case law develops the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors distributions in violation of law or agreement llc acts typically prohibit an llc from making certain distributions for example the final draft of the revised uniform limited liability company act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution  the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company�s activities or  the company�s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if the company were to be dissolved wound up and terminated at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution winding up and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution a member of a membermanaged limited liability company or manager of a managermanaged limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions in addition a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper is limited liability an illusion although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule the llc offers excellent protection from many types of liabilities for example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud the llc should shield you from personal liability if you sell a product that without your knowledge or fault is defective you should not have personal liability trade creditors who deal with the llc without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment shoring up limited liability there are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the llc business insurance carrying adequate business insurance wont change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence but it can help by providing a source for payment you might also consider a personal umbrella policy avoid personal guarantees not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee in many cases landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided learn to question the request capitalize the business adequately provide adequate capital for the entitys intended purposes and document the capital infusion keep the llc separate from your personal business no matter how small the business is it should have its own bank account dont pay personal expenses from the business account instead write yourself a check called a draw on the llc account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses likewise dont use personal checks to pay llc bills if the llc needs funds make a capital contribution or loan and account for everything act ethically dont attempt to mislead the llcs creditors about the financial condition of the business do not divert assets if the business looks like it is going down dont attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the llc that will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets if you act responsibly and take a few precautions the limited liability of the llc is still a major benefit over a sole proprietorship or general partnership related articles llc advantages llc disadvantages llc vs corporation
