total return is generated by current income with low volatility portfolio construction is driven by sector weightings and asset selection that consider the economic exposure of a particular metropolitan area and geography global or regional separate account commingled fund collective investment trust valueadded consists of investments in “nonstabilized” property where approximately half the total return is generated by growth with higher volatility investments with this risk profile are typically timesensitive and by their nature are in a less efficient part of the investable universe we seek quality property where we can identify a physical operational or financial improvement opportunity that we can address through active management and that has been mispriced by the market higher leverage is typically employed as part of the capitalization to enhance the return on equity global or regional separate account commingled fund opportunistic designed for clients who seek investments in “nonstabilized” property where the majority of the total return is generated by growth with higher volatility these investments are typically capitalized utilizing a higher level of leverage to enhance the return on equity global or regional separate account   for more information on how to access these solutions please visit the vehicles page we strive to build longstanding
