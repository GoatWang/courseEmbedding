customers and shareholders on august   the us securities and exchange commission sec approved the final rule regarding the sourcing of “conflict minerals” ie tantalum tin tungsten and gold under section  of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act under the rule publicly traded companies like iivi must report to the sec the presence of conflict minerals originating in the democratic republic of the congo drc or adjoining countries in the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture if the conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of their products these reports must be filed with the sec annually by may st beginning in  iivi is concerned that the trade of conflict minerals mined in the eastern provinces of the drc may be fueling human rights atrocities in the region these minerals are widely used in our products and the end markets served by iivi as a result we support the actions of governments and organizations to increase supply chain transparency and enable companies to source conflictfree minerals iivi is committed to sourcing materials from companies that share our values around human rights ethics and environmental responsibility we have initiated a comprehensive process to meet these regulatory requirements taking steps to increase our supply chain due diligence measures and internal controls for the covered minerals iivi also expects its suppliers to develop internal conflict minerals policies due diligence frameworks and management systems which are designed to identify and ultimately eliminate from use in products sold to iivi any conflict minerals which are known to come from sources funding armed groups in the drc region iivi fully expects our suppliers to cooperate with us and to provide information to support these efforts suppliers that do not reasonably comply with iivi’s conflict minerals policy will be reviewed by iivi to assess whether we will conduct business with those suppliers in the future we will disclose our progress in implementing this conflict minerals policy through public reporting including through our website and sec filings please click the link below

fiber and direct diode lasers the optics are made from lowabsorbing fused silica substrates they undergo magneto rheological finishing to achieve λ of surface irregularity and  nm of roughness with a highperformance proprietary ion beam sputtering coating they achieve  ppm of total absorption loss the kw optics are available in many complex shapes used in today’s high power beam shaping applications such as aspheres axicons and high aspect ratio lenses improved lens quality enables the lasers to maintain high reliability at high power levels and over long periods of time the nextgeneration fiber and direct diode lasers can be used in metal cutting and welding as well as additive manufacturingvisit company websitehttpwwwiiviinfraredcomabout this
