financial condition during the twelvemonth period following the date of this quarterly report we anticipate that we will not generate any revenue accordingly we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to pursue our plan of operations during and beyond the next twelve months we believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or shareholder loans however we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or shareholder loans to establish our new business

corridor liquidity and capital resources our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation we have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to our business plans for these reasons our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements for the year ended december   that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern going concern uncertainties are also expressed in note  of our financial statements for the quarter ended march   as of march   our current assets were  and our current liabilities were  resulting in a working capital deficit of  our current liabilities consisted of  due to related parties and  of accounts payables and accrued

our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development acquisitions or expansion consequently we do not expect to pay dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future the success of our growth strategy is dependent upon the availability of additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to management our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities which include common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings capital leases and longterm debt there can be no assurance that we can raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms we believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next  months we anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and shareholder loans in order to continue to fund our business operations issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders

prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap � use of estimates in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements

expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  of the

other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date level  pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument the carrying amounts of the companys financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the
