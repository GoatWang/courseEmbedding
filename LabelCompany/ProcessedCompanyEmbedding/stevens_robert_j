structural requirements tubing is available from thousands of stock mandrels eliminating costly tooling charges we offer everything from  round id micro miniature sizes up to  plus id square and rectangular offerings start at  x  id and go up to  square in size in addition to tubing we have custom molding facilities as well match metal dies and custom steel rule trim dies produce a variety of motor winding end turn insulators and caps stevens products has developed a custom line of printed circuit board manufacturing aides our “gold finger gloves” cover gold contacts can eliminate use of costly kapton tape pcb stiffeners clip on board edges and incorporate our proprietary fiberglass epoxy pultruded rod the rod has  psi flexural strength and prevents board twist and warp through wave
