assistance with establishing and expanding its business “we see the staffing function being a synergistic complement to alumifuel’s wholly owned subsidiary novofuel inc which continues to pursue hybrid renewable energy systems solutions for a variety of offgrid power applications” alumifuel ceo henry fong said “in a concurrent initiative we are pursuing the consolidation of certain of alumifuel’s convertible debt as this will be an important element in future financing considerations for potential acquisitions we will be advising our stockholders further as these actions move forward and materialize” the georgia acquisition from labor smart closed at the end of last week while the tennessee acquisition closed last month the deals included a combination of cash and stock assets purchased consist of the business operations including customer lists contracts fixed assets leases and certain other intangibles for operation of the ongoing business “the acquisition of over  million in revenue within the past  days for staffing operations signifies our commitment to building a solid foundation in the temporary staffing business” fong said “by acquiring the assets of a
