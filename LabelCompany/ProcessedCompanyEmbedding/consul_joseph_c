november   by richard d mckinzie  mckinzie mr ambassador you were i think in charge of the legation in damascus at the time that president roosevelt died and when president truman assumed office do you have any recollections about what happened on the occasion of president roosevelts death and how the coming to office of a new president affected your outlook and the outlook of the middle easterners with whom you had contact satterthwaite well yes i remember it very dramatically because i was in charge of our legation in  damascus the minister plenipotentiary george wadsworth lived in beirut over two ranges of mountains and when he wasnt in damascus i was in charge president roosevelt had left tremendous impressions throughout the near east in his war efforts i had a condolence book and all day long people of an amazing variety came to visit me the syrian officials came and signed the book france was still officially the protecting power and individuals from general paul beynet down to a corporal i remember came in and signed the book most impressive to me were some of the heads of the great tribes the still nomadic tribes on the great syrian desert who came in in their robes of course and their abbas and so on it lasted all day long with an amazing outpouring of emotion but they knew very little about president truman as our vice presidents arent very highly publicized overseas as a rule  except maybe spiro agnew now a little more and so all i could say was that were never without a president fortunately and that our new president is harry s truman mckinzie the middle east seemed to have a particular interest for president roosevelt there is some evidence that he wanted to use iran perhaps as a test case for the atlantic charter that here was a place where you could see if it was going to work were you aware at the end of the war of any expectations on the part of the syrian government or any other middle eastern government about development plans that they might expect the united states to help them with satterthwaite well in connection with iran lets go back to my days in baghdad which were just before world war ii and of course the problem  we had being close to the border of iran and very much in touch with iranian affairs after the war by the time i was in the office of near eastern and african affairs the principal iranian problem was azerbaijan the russians had occupied it even though they had shared the occupation with the british but they wouldnt move out of this northern province and this was one of our greatest problems in  and  maybe someone would say it was some other problem but it seems to me this was the first great success of the united nations because in the debates at the security council it was the worldwide publicity that this problem got that in effect forced the russians finally to pull their troops out of azerbaijan and leave all of iran to be governed by the old shah mckinzie may i interject here that president truman wrote a book with the help of assistants after he did his memoirs in which he contends that he  said to stalin that he should withdraw the troops from azerbaijan or he truman would send the american mediterranean fleet into the persian gulf and historians have not been able to come up with any document to premier stalin suggesting that that was going to happen in your own personal recollections satterthwaite no i dont have any recollections of that and it seems to me he would certainly have told dean acheson at least whom he thought so highly of if it were so i dont recall it ever having been mentioned in any of our many meetings but i shouldnt dispute truman if he said so mckinzie but historians have been puzzled that such a document has never been found satterthwaite certainly i have no recollection of this now as to sending the fleet into the persian gulf of course its still a long way from the soviet union one of our fears always   and now it can be told  secretly was that because of the russian desire the imperial russian desire also to have a warm water port they might drive down to the persian gulf some day and at one time after world war ii we knew they had some airborne divisions poised in the caucasus and we were disturbed and took counteraction to a degree i dont think there was any real question of our sending ships into the persian gulf we had one old mother ship there which wouldnt have deterred much of anybody and it would have been almost impossible for us to carry out an action in the persian gulf the kind of action that we would have had to take would have been not of a warlike kind but you know hurting the russians in all the other ways you could think of economically i cant imagine how we could have really frightened stalin even if we did have a fleet in the mediterranean mckinzie at that time were you aware of the fact  that very many people in trumans cabinet and in the military were seeing the middle east as an increasingly important area secretary harold ickes for example got very excited at the end of the war about the oil potential in the middle east as indeed did secretary robert p patterson arguing to president truman at one point that the united states could fight a major world war for only three years without the oil this seemed to be a kind of new or recent concern didnt it satterthwaite i dont remember that though it may be true by the time i was director of the near eastern and african affairs ickes was concerned about india in one way nehru was to make a trip to the us and i remember ickes got me on the phone about the details of arranging his visit but i dont remember if anything came of it it would have had to have come through the  white house pretty much ickes being ickes would have dealt directly with acheson if he wanted to i am sure or with bob robert a lovett probably incidentally i had the greatest admiration for lovett as i did for general marshall but lovett was the one that handled the details always you see marshall operated like a general with a chief of staff and lovett was his chief of staff and he often used to tell me the general and i operate as a team mckinzie mr ambassador what about the theory that the united states didnt fill the power vacuum in the middle east as fast as it might have with the decline of the french influence and indeed british influence in the middle east that were leaving a kind of political turmoil satterthwaite if you will remember  you may be too young to  but the first few months after the war we were demobilizing just as rapidly as we  could and i remember larry lauris norstad as a young major general lecturing to the political officers of the state department saying how fortunate it was that there were great new problems while we were almost completely disarmed and so we could build up a new army mckinzie you mentioned that when you came back to the state department in september of  there were a lot of ambassadors coming back from the middle east and they found president truman relatively accessible satterthwaite thats right mckinzie what kind of things were they telling him about the middle east satterthwaite well he was interested in the middle east as i said we were rather surprised how easy it was to make appointments for them actually with one or two exceptions they were still ministers  plenipotentiary the posts were raised to the rank of ambassador maybe in  or  but anyway they were our representatives there and of course he was interested in palestine but remember that didnt become a real political problem until  and im talking about the fall of  now and he was interested in that area what to do about it and what would happen there and what they were like even though a lot of people didnt know the difference between iraq and iran for instance that was certainly true of this famous general who made so much trouble in china later on  patrick hurley this picturesque general who came to the near east during the last days of the war and when he was in baghdad he was talking as if he was in iran and i suspect in teheran about iraq but im not sure but we know the iraqis werent especially amused that he didnt even know the name of their country mckinzie later in  and certainly by  there  was a lot of talk about the revolution of rising expectations on the part of the people were you involved in that discussion and how to go about fulfilling these expectations that the peoples of the area had satterthwaite im not sure that that problem wasnt written about subsequently although we were thinking about it at the time certainly we had the problem for getting aid now the one country that needed it only briefly of course was saudi arabia they felt very poor at the end of the war because of course they couldnt develop their oil in wartime but i still recall  maybe in the fall of   being invited to a reception at which champagne was flowing out of a fountain the sort of thing that you put your cup under ibn saud learned about this later you know the saudis were not supposed to drink liquor and so later on their parties were dry but this was nice while it lasted  saudi arabia of course is potentially except for kuwait i suppose one of the countries with the highest gross national product per capita in the world kuwait of course is way ahead of everybody else i visited kuwait from my legation in baghdad in  when the first oil well was going down before any oil had been discovered i went out and visited the rig on the desert mckinzie its changed considerably since then satterthwatte it seems to me rising expectations were certainly a part of the developing world but it certainly wasnt up on the front burner as i recall and of course it may be that it was being dealt with elsewhere i am sure that the assistant secretary of state for economic affairs didnt spend a great deal of time thinking about the near east because we had all the problems of getting europe started and then we  had the far east but no doubt they were thinking about this very much mckinzie when the large aid programs began in europe some of the developing countries away from europe and im thinking specifically of latin america did voice some resentment at this europe first policy did you have to deal with that to any large degree satterthwaite no but of course you see at first it was turkey and greece to begin with the first great aid program under the truman doctrine and then of course the marshall plan did come out of that and later on the appropriations for  and  even certainly  aid for greece and turkey was included in the marshall plan appropriations i dont remember being troubled by that in the near east of course you see  was the year in which india and pakistan got their independence and then next year you had burma and ceylon and some other  countries so the first aid programs in other words had to come from the british empire and did to the countries they were giving up i dont recall that we gave any aid to ceylon for years i may be wrong in that mckinzie no we didnt satterthwaite certainly not when i was there from  to  mckinzie what then did you conceive to be the greatest problem in maintaining stability of the area since it had strategic and economic importance to the united states it would be in the national interest to maintain the stability of the area satterthwaite well are we talking about the immediate postwar period now mckinzie yes from  lets say through  satterthwaite well one of the things that disturbed  us was the expiration of a law permitting us to give military assistance outside of latin america weve long had a basic law by which we could send military missions and give military assistance to latin america and i accompanied general marshall soon after he became secretary of state to an appearance before the house military affairs committee  probably the only time almost that a secretary of state has appeared before that committee trying to persuade congress to extend this legislation and the house was willing but the senate blocked it harry byrd i think principally general marshall didnt go to the senate hearing as perhaps he should have but anyway this was fascinating because it was like old home week in the house this committee was so glad to see general marshall again that it made it very interesting and of course the house committee under vinson would give him anything he wanted nearly the senate was more stubborn as it often is  mckinzie there was a gap in there between lendlease and the creation of eca that got operating finally in  im wondering how you felt about the sort of parallel organization of the economic cooperation administration which dealt directly in most cases with countries and the office of near eastern affairs satterthwaite well you see for those immediately postwar years in spite of what happened in syria when the french lost their heads and bombed damascus they continued to give all the aid to lebanon they needed and even some to syria after this episode the british continued of course to support palestine and then after all it was in  before they pulled out of there so it was pretty much the former colonial powers which continued to give assistance to the arab world at that period when lendlease really got going i believe egypt was the first country to get aid from eca  mckinzie egypt did get large amounts of eca aid satterthwaite of course were also talking about another area  india and pakistan  india i think got more than any other country in the end didnt it mckinzie yes but it got aid of technical assistance nature and developmental nature satterthwaite thats right it did mckinzie did you have any particular feelings when this aid effort started about the kind of aid that would be one most effective for the country and two most beneficial for american interests in the near east satterthwaite yes we certainly did think about it and i kept in close touch with the eca and the truman doctrine group which were giving aid to greece and turkey the actual working out of this  aid program was not in what was then the office of near eastern and african affairs it was handled instead by the aid part of the department under various names until it finally became aid we were very much involved and attended the meetings of course and one of the things loy henderson did when he was director  because of this aid program the near eastern division had included at one time the balkans as well as the near east was to transfer from the near eastern division greece turkey and iran all three of which bordered on communist countries and all of which were getting large aid programs and formed a division of greek turkish and iranian affairs and of course they were involved very much in the aid program whereas the middle eastern countries were much less so except for palestine or israel as it became after  mckinzie would you say that by  a large percentage of the time of the bureau of near eastern affairs  was occupied with the palestinian problem satterthwaite yes of the near eastern division certainly it was so important that there were a lot of people doing nothing else every arab country of course was deeply involved in the palestine problem felt very strongly and emotionally about it so the dominant problem up until the recognition of israel was the future of palestine and after that the problems created by the fact of the existence of israel mckinzie did the palestine issue strain the relationship that you had had previously with leaders of arab governments satterthwaite not particularly because we were career men and while we were loyally carrying out the policy set for us by the presidents secretary of state we had known and worked with so many of the arab leaders and of course their diplomats in washington theyd generally get along with  us so while it was certainly difficult for them it created no particular problem for usthat is the day by day relations were not affected there were still good working relations right along no matter how much they disliked our policy toward israel and although i was not an arabist we had in our office quite a number of arabists whose whole career was dealing with arabs and who spoke arabic of course it was not necessary to speak arabic with their diplomats all of whom spoke english or french fluently this changed interestingly enough in the years after world war i in fact all the representatives of former french areas at the united nations spoke french for the first three or four years of the united nations and then gradually changed over to english there were rare exceptions israel used to have one of its delegates who spoke in spanish he was a sephardic and had come out of argentina to boot and so with his tongue in cheek  and the israelis loved having him do  it because they wanted the latinamericans on their side anyway  he made all his speeches in spanish mckinzie was there a lively dialogue within the office of near eastern affairs about resolution of the palestine problem i know that some people believed that there was hope for a binational state would you characterize that as the dominant view of the bureau satterthwaite well this was the hope that partition wouldnt be necessary because of the fear of exactly what did happen and has continued to happen the hope for peace in that part of the world was a binational state we felt and it may have been a false dream or hope that it could take place but it was worth the effort certainly and maybe it could have been worked out except for the unfortunate fact maybe that we had the city elections in new york in  and the national elections in   mckinzie you personally think that was so satterthwaite well they had an impact of course understandably and we have always accepted this fact there werent many arab votes you know and in new york city after all the jewish vote was of greatest importance to both parties i cant remember exactly the timing but my recollection is that bevin probably on the eve of the  election in new york city in a confidential telegram to the president expressed the hope that in a speech he the president was about to make he wouldnt ask for more than  thousand additional jewish emigrants to palestine nevertheless he came out in a speech not two hours later for a hundred thousand and governor thomas e dewey made a speech in new york city the next day advocating  thousand so you can see this was a domestic problem in a very big way the impact of that i think probably as much as anything made a binational state impossible  i think we still might have had one on  thousand more maybe this would never have worked but we thought it was certainly worth trying mckinzie was any other solution to the jewish refugee problem seriously considered by the bureau of near eastern affairs satterthwaite not that i can recall you see people talked about why not go to kenya thats a great area but it was perfectly clear it wasnt just a question of going someplace after all it was the fact that their homeland was israel and that was where they wanted to go not just to go anywhere where they could make a living of course one of the anomalies is that relatively few american jews actually have settled in israel and i think the zionists groups have felt that israel is much better off with the ethnic jews remaining in the united states where  they could keep the money flowing into israel which they have done with great success there have been a few thousand american jews who settled in israel i dont know what the number is you may mckinzie it is not large when israel was finally formed there was a huge arab refugee problem which must have caused some interesting maneuvering in your office satterthwaite yes and of course as you will recall they were put in the gaza strip and we thought it would have been better if we could have put more in these great vacant places in syria but it didnt work out that way mckinzie do you recall why i am not familiar with the reason satterthwaite no i think that the arabs wanted it the other way but anyway you know about the eleven jews killed at the olympic games remember  these arabs boys who did it were born in the arab refugee centers and brought up with this hatred in their hearts from children that they had been put out of their homeland mckznzie was there some recognition of the fact that that might happen at the time satterthwaite why i think so but of course one couldnt know this was  years later but they were brought up in these camps and had the hatred instilled in them at having been displaced from their homeland mckinzie there was a united nations mission sent to the middle east in  as i recall headed by gordon clapp satterthwaite thats right mckinzie did you have any connection with that satterthwaite yes we were very much involved and there was one very prominent democratic politician  also on that mission its a shame not to remember his name he was very important and still is in the democratic party of course their recommendations couldnt be carried out if i recall in any event it was worth the effort certainly mckinzie well they did recommend economic developments projects and even some work programs for the refugees satterthwaite yes thats right mckinzie did you have the impression that secretary marshall and later acheson conceived of the middle eastern problem as primarily a united nations problem or a us problem satterthwaite they would have loved to have made it a united nations problem but of course as the top politicians of jewish faith in the democratic party could get to see the president and anybody they wanted to immediately it really  became more than that of necessity mckinzie well im thinking specifically of these development schemes satterthwaite yes and i think it would have been much better to have the un do it in this connection the israeli representatives for several years you know couldnt talk to the delegates whether in a subcommittee or the main committees on either side of them because they were always arabs this was before the year we got so many new members and the problem was solved for them oh ive forgotten the year now but fortunately for them the new delegates on each side of them were no longer arabs i used to watch before that every time the israel representative had to go to the bathroom for example and there wasnt anybody else sitting behind him he had to take all of his papers with him this was at the security council meetings of course not at the general  assembly mckinzie how did you happen to get appointed as the head of the special mission to nepal satterthwaite well i was available i guess it was exceedingly interesting loy henderson whom youre seeing  incidentally i believe hes been working on this problem for his memoirs and will be much more au courant will be better prepared than i to tell you i should have but i havent taken time with other things im doing to go back and review the records which involves going to the national archives now i had done it for an article on the truman doctrine and i have access there but im doing other things so i havent reviewed the literature and as ive told you i believe i never kept personal papers of classified nature and practically everything was classified in those days rightly or wrongly  mckinzie could you narrate for the record a little bit of what happened on this special mission to nepal satterthwaite oh yes i have lots of material on that and i wrote an article for the foreign service journal about it too in maybe august  but this was probably one of the most fascinating missions in my service in the sense that it meant opening up relations with a country which had been literally almost completely isolated for one hundred years and thats the way they wanted it  the ruling rana family the reason they asked the united states to send the mission was that they finally became convinced that the british in august  were really leaving india so they decided they didnt want to be completely dependent on india and lets open relations with another power and of course at that time the united states was the dominant power in the world militarily and in many other  ways and so they asked us to send the mission i happened to be available i was on loy hendersons staff we had a very good group going out ray raymond a hare who later became director for near eastern and african affairs went with me hare was in washington and he was about to become the chief i guess it still was of the division of south asian affairs later the office so after going to nepal with me he visited this new area the consulates in india and what in a few months became pakistan this is april  and the partition of india was in august of  and we did have the privilege of seeing india in the last days of the raj and having luncheon with the mountbattens a small intimate luncheon of about  people with bearers behind every chair in magnificent uniforms and adcs flying around we were seeing the last days of the splendor of the british empire and the mountbattens were interested in my mission because he had been to nepal but the  british in general couldnt get beyond the tarsi the lowlands and were seldom allowed into the valley of nepal nevertheless the british had a resident minister there moreover in spite of the fact that the minister clearly realized that my mission meant the eventual end of the exclusive control of nepal by the british he was very helpful to me and when our communications broke down he let me send coded messages through his office to new delhi and i had a chance to tell him some years later at least my mission meant that you got promoted from minister to ambassador which it did and i had the pleasure of entertaining him when i was ambassador in ceylon a few years later when he finally left nepal and he also was knighted mckinzie i take it there were considerable formalities in connection with this satterthwaite always this was out of this world because one could only think that probably this  was the way it was in calcutta  years before before the british moved the capital to new delhi all the splendor and everything and of course i kept thinking of my secondhand ford back in washington while i was taking the rounds with these beautiful almost magnificent coaches and four for each of us with most magnificent uniforms and the outriders there would be six horses pulling the carriages and durbars which you read about in indian history everyday and finally signing the agreement of friendship and commerce at the auspicious hour fixed by the hindu priest which was at  in the afternoon with a hundred and one guns going off for the maharajah and seventeen for me no this was unique and i have to thank loy henderson again for asking me to head the mission mckinzie what was the residue of the mission  satterthwaite ray hare went out with me from washington in new delhi the economic counselor sam day and lieutenant colonel hosket the assistant military attache joined the mission and i got a viceconsul j jefferson jones in bombay who had already visited nepal with george merrill who was acting us commissioner in delhi and i picked up a viceconsul clerk in karachi which was still part of india to act as secretary lets see in addition to day and hare and hosket we also had bill johnstone who was in the public affairs office in new delhi and we had three bearers servants one christian one hindu and one moslem and when we got to raxaul on the frontier the maharajah had a private railroad of about  miles and so we rode in great splendor in this then we were taken in cars for the next  miles to a resthouse where we spent the night and there we picked up over a hundred bearers because we had  to be carried in sedan chairs seven of them and hundreds of porters and with lanterns at night it was a sight to remember until we got to his resthouse up in the hills then from there on we declined riding in the sedan chairs until we got over the second range and were coming into the valley of nepal and they asked us as a favor to ride down in them because we either preferred to ride the ponies or walk what a beautiful part of the world it is it was the wrong time of year to see mount everest but the mountains cleared just at one time for a glimpse and i never saw it again until i got to darjeeling when i was ambassador in burma and went to darjeeling on a short vacation mckinzie then would you talk a little about your work in ceylon between  and  satterthwaite well yes of course president truman was my president and ceylon was a beautiful  remote place where i pretty much called the signals if i wanted to until june of  when the fighting in korea broke out then of course ceylon became of some importance as a fueling station for our naval vessels and liberty for the sailors we didnt send troops that way but the mediterranean fleet would go out from time to time and go back again we had sometimes an aircraft carrier mostly one cruiser and maybe four or even eight destroyers of course the ceylonese thought it was fine because they were there for the day spent a lot of money had a wonderful time and were wellbehaved our sailors  no troops going that way mckinzie did you have extended discussions with the ceylonese government about development plans for ceylon were they interested in that to the point where they were willing to make formal application for it satterthwaite no because they had the colombo plan  from  mckinzie i wonder if you would talk about that for a while satterthwaite well you see in  india and pakistan and in  ceylon all got their independence under the commonwealth and the question was how the british would continue to aid and they had the colombo conference of commonwealth foreign ministers in colombo in january  and i had presented credentials in november  so ernie ernest bevin the foreign minister of britain percy spender and all these people showed up in colombo which most people didnt know much about except maybe for lipton tea bags which had a map of ceylon this was a tremendous occasion and sir percy spender whom i saw quite a bit of during this conference and who later was ambassador in washington was quite annoyed because during the first or second afternoon of the meetings jr jayawardene the finance minister of ceylon  asked to speak and he pulled a speech out of his pocket and stole sir percys thunder because he was going to propose a colombo plan but anyway i remember percy walking up and down with scotch in his hand in his hotel room talking that damn  hes a colorful character as australians often are and this was fascinating because we werent involved but i entertained all of them except nehru and this is a long story he sent his number two i was the only ambassador the others were high commissioners so this was the only time in history i suppose that from the moment i presented credentials i was dean of the diplomatic corps and this changed because the canadians didnt want any of this damn nonsense that an ambassador had precedence over a high commissioner but the foreign office in england correctly said this is true that a high commissioner cant present credentials to the queen he is representing the  queen you see but anyway the pressures came from india and australia and never again was an ambassador so far as i know at the head of the diplomatic corps in any of the commonwealth countries mckinzie how long did this last satterthwaite oh i dont know but anyway it did mean that i was dean of the corps during the colombo plan conference but i entertained the high commissioner and we werent involved and i was only invited to the final session which was the only public session i was of some help during the conference to percy spender but especially to mike pearson of canada and the last day he made a speech and i remember his saying he thought it was only fair that there should be at least one speech in a north american accent and he didnt say canadian we also had great numbers of correspondents  they soon formed together in two noncompeting groups which shared the information they picked up but i formally got most of my information from pearson and spender i was told that roger makins who was british minister in washington would keep me informed so i got in touch with him and he said well we had a meeting of our delegation the last night and it was decided that this was really a family commonwealth problem so im sorry i wont be able to help you as a result i went to see spender and pearson and first thing spender said we know we should keep no secrets from the united states but we have to depend on the united states for our security and pearson said after all ive got all these newspapermen i got to tell them whats going on so i can certainly tell you from the canadian standpoint we were only very indirectly involved in the conference but naturally we wanted to know what was going on  and with their assistance i could tell the state department of developments one of the interesting byproducts was that we only had old strip codes then in ceylon which nobody had ever heard much about but the colombo conference put us on the map and i got coding machines out and all kinds of things as a result of this conference and we got organized like a real embassy it had just been a consulate up to  mckinzie did you then make any trips back to the united states during your tenure as ambassador to ceylon satterthwaite yes i came back to sit on a selection board and i had home leave mckinzie did you talk to president truman any of these times satterthwaite no not in those days i had before  i went out to ceylon but i didnt get to see him again mckinzie do you recall your conversation with him before you went out satterthwaite well the old rules in those days was that we in the state department werent supposed to keep records of conversations with the president i may have scratched out a few notes but i havent found them if i have and actually i am in the process of going through those papers now but not very rapidly but anyway it was a very pleasant conversation and as i mentioned in this letter he was fascinated with that part of the world  only he got adams peak mixed up with mount st thomas which is the hill outside of madras i never told him im not so sure that i knew it myself at the time but as soon as i got out there i realized the mistake but i had an extremely pleasant conversation with him  did i ever see him again no but i saw eisenhower his  successor several times mckinzie president truman may have had a slightly different way of using the state department from perhaps president eisenhower im not sure satterthwaite but actually he had secretaries of state whom he had confidence in and i was lucky to be in the department when he was president because the white house wasnt running foreign affairs except through the secretary of state with both general marshall and dean acheson mckinzie so you felt that the talent that the state department had was being used satterthwaite yes i had also however a very short time with james byrnes as secretary of course general marshall could see the president anytime but being a general he never took advantage of this in fact on one occasion i think it was over palestine actually he told the president  i was told by somebody at the meeting  mr  president if you take this action i wouldnt vote for you but of course i dont vote he as an army officer never voted apparently in his life i always voted by mail when i could but i always called myself an independent because i felt that i shouldnt be partisan i still have that feeling mckinzie did you feel that you were shielded pretty much from political pressures and pressure groups in the bureau of near eastern affairs satterthwaite yes i never had any pressure from the white house that was objectionable in the least obviously pressures were brought by congress sometimes but thats something else thats just par for the course you can expect that but certainly not from the white house under either truman or eisenhower i think this is true of kennedy too  he was president and then johnson  during my four and a half years in south africa  i dont know why but maybe its because of the job i had it wasnt that they wouldnt send political people to see me but i certainly never felt under any pressure to take any action i thought was wrong if they made a decision i accepted it of course because a career man either does or resigns if its anything of vital interest and it never was mckinzie where do you think as you look back now president truman will rate as a president satterthwaite well i was astonished to see the other day in some poll that he didnt have a high rating because i think those of us that worked with him would rate him very high maybe not in the very top category but certainly as an outstanding president he made decisions and usually the right ones we felt and was a man of courage while he didnt have any great background in foreign affairs except that fortunately he did have the  truman committee on lendlease and he had had that exposure as a senator when he suddenly became vice president but in any event he did have an interest in foreign affairs in that experience his first great mistake was one he realized when he accepted the advice of politicians rather than foreign service experts on lendlease and as i recall he admits it in his memoirs doesnt he and he didnt let that happen again palestine was something apart youd have to accept the fact that this was  i think he felt strongly himself he stuck by eddie jacobson who was his great and good friend certainly as one or two of our boys in the united nations said he was right there on the job and lots of funny things happened one day during a united nations session the president couldnt get first general marshall and then he couldnt get herschel johnson both of the united nations so he got someone else who carried out his instructions  with a great enthusiasm either of the others would have persuaded him to modify them a little at a crucial time in the un security council debate this is just luck you see mckinzie getting ahold of the right man satterthwaite yes instead of getting the man that he got unfortunately when he couldnt get either marshall or johnson top of the page
