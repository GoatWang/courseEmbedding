markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio
