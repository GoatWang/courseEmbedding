may    am et dallas clement the tripleplay triplethreat man at cox a background in gadgets finance and business development helps clement keep cox moving forwardby by robert marich why this mattersdallas clementdallas clementtitle senior vp of strategy and product management cox communicationseducation ba harvard college  ms stanford university employment merrill lynch financial analyst  cox communications analyst manager of financial analysis director of finance  cox enterprisescox communications assistant treasurer  cox communications treasurer vptreasurer  current position since personal wife anna daughters courtney  abby  lauren  and dallas  when dallas clement was finishing grad school at stanford university in  he sent job applications to two cable industry giants a friend also suggested using an executive recruiter that headhunter set clement up for an interview in atlanta at cox communications where he was soon hired “quite frankly” recalls clement “i hadnt ever heard of them”his two dream cable employer picks disappeared in mergers long ago now  years later clement is senior vp of strategy and product management at cox the nations thirdranked multiplesystem operator with  million residential and commercial customersclement graduated from stanford with an ms in engineeringeconomic systems “im a gadget guy who likes to know how things work but im also practical in terms of what is affordable” he says thats a handy background for a man who decides what product enhancements—whether improvements in email or parental controls for tv channels—to pile on cables tripleplay foundation of digital video voice and broadband“dallas is a rare example of someone who can grasp the nuances of the technology and also put together a business model for implementation of that technology” says richard r green president and ceo of cablelabs the nonprofit research arm of the cable industry that studies ways to integrate technologyclement sees the job of business development becoming increasingly complex “in the s it was all about execution and simply getting digital video digital voice and highspeed to as many homes as possible” he says “today the challenge is prioritization of initiatives what service enhancements will add to the triple play and how can we do it efficiently we cant be effective if we try to do everything at once”with consumer expectations high and plenty of competition in the marketplace clement says the cable industry needs to introduce new features services and products with greater efficiency so “collaborative efforts are necessary to win” he says the docsis protocol for cable modems is one example that has served the industry well up next is the truway cable industry specification for interactive television applications which allows consumers to purchase video devices at retail that plugandplay on cable networks nationwideas competition comes from every direction especially satellite tv and telcos its a challenge to find the right balance “i think people can be too reactive these days to competition as opposed to sticking to their strategy” clement says “if your strategy is sound and you execute well you will be better off versus reacting to your competitors tactics the biggest challenge is to define what your differentiation is in the marketplace and stick to that”a big part of that comes in dissecting hidden motives of rivals after they subtly signal their longterm strategies its one of clements particular strengths “in a discussion about a product announcement from another company he will look at it not only from the product side but what it might do for them beyond what meets the eye” says steve necessary cox communications vp of video strategy and product management “hell look at what the new product will set them up for as a second and third followon activity” necessary is one of four executives who report to clement and each has a sector of product responsibility with necessary covering video the other executives fan out for oversight on data voice and wirelessclement hasnt always been the gadget man at cox from mid through  he held finance posts at the cable companys parent cox enterprises where he worked on more than  billion in cable acquisitions and his finance skills were tested this includes helping arrange the sale of teleport the first largescale local telephone exchange to compete with the bell phone giants which cox and its two cable partners sold to att the att stock that cox received was used to help fund acquisitionsputting down rootsback when he was scouting for jobs out of grad school in california clement was comfortable with the prospect of putting down roots in the south at coxs atlanta headquarters because he grew up in florida hes proud of the cox corporate culture of paternalism that was in evidence when it kept employees of its new orleans cable system on the payroll after hurricane katrina washed away their jobs for a time “thats our culture” he says today he lives in atlanta with his wife and four daughters the youngest of whom is also named dallashis tenure in finance during the s involved more innovative work than some would think for a corporate treasury executive a  billion cox investment in what became sprint pcs was valued at  billion at its peak to finance the slate of acquisitions clement monetized the sprint pcs stake through a number of innovative structures including several convertible securities “when you do  billion in financings they cant all be plain vanilla” clement saysclement views those finance days as not so far removed from newproducts duties today “i enjoy getting closer to technology and being more operationally focused” he says “thats been great where its similar to my finance background is this if you think about what made enron go under enron got in trouble because it did not understand all the risks associated with its various financing structures you have to ask a lot of questions i learned to ask a lot of questions when i was treasurer and we were working on our  billion of acquisitions and financings im not uncomfortable asking all the basic and naïve questions now of vendors to help make cox products successful”to see a gallery of fifth estater caricatures click here tagsyou may also like next article primetime ratings nbc wins monday as voice
