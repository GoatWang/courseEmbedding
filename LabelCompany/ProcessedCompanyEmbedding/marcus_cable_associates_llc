proceeding arises under the occupational safety and health act of   usc section  hereafter called the “act”             at all times relevant to this action marcus cable associates llc marcus maintained a place of business in burleson texas where it was engaged in providing and maintaining cable service marcus admits it is an employer engaged in a business affecting commerce and is subject to the requirements of the act marcus is a subsidiary of charter cable operating company llc which is owned by charter communications operating llc  which is in turn held by charter communications holding company llc tr vol ii p  exh r the citation and complaint in this matter were originally issued to charter communications inc charter at the hearing marcus introduced testimony showing inter alia that charter owns less than  percent of the holding company that owns marcus tr vol ii p  as a result the secretary and marcus entered into a stipulation identifying marcus as the employer of the affected employees in this case and requesting the substitution of marcus cable associates llc as the respondent in this action the parties’ request to amend the caption in this matter is granted and will be reflected in this decision and order and in any further pleadings             on april   jurica miskovic fell to his death from the bucket of a ford f bucket truck following the fatality the occupational safety and health administration osha conducted an inspection of miskovic’s working conditions as a result of that inspection citations were issued to miskovic’s employer now identified as respondent marcus cable associates llc the citation alleges violations of the act together with proposed penalties by filing a timely notice of contest respondent brought this proceeding before the occupational safety and health review commission commission             on november   a hearing was held in dallas texas the parties have submitted briefs on the issues and this matter is ready for disposition facts             aaron villareal a system technician with marcus tr vol i p  testified that he had lunch with jurica miskovic on april   tr vol i p  because mr miskovic was finished with his calls for that day he volunteered to help villareal with the remainder of his repairs tr vol i p  villareal stated that miskovic raised the bucket of his truck about  feet above the ground to work on an elevated cable tr vol i p  miskovic had been issued a full body harness and lanyard but was not wearing them tr vol i p  villareal testified that miskovic was a grown man and made his own decisions villareal would not have presumed to tell him to wear his fall protection tr vol i pp  villareal turned away to stow a test line for miskovic when he turned around he saw miskovic fall from the basket to the ground tr vol i pp  miskovic’s harness was found in the tool bin of his truck after the accident tr vol i p              villareal testified that when he was promoted to system technician he received onthejob training from more experienced technicians tr vol i p  villareal rode along on service calls and observed the other technicians trvol i pp  kenneth trujillo a system technician with marcus communications from october  to august  tr vol i p  also testified that his training consisted solely of onthejob training received during ridealongs tr vol i pp  trujillo stated that the training he received covered splicing cable balancing cable amplifiers etc he did not receive training in the safe operation of a bucket truck tr vol i p  villareal testified similarly but stated that he was able to operate the truck without difficulty without the benefit of any formal training tr vol i pp   he stated that the hazards associated with operating a bucket truck ie energized overhead lines and fall hazards were common knowledge among service technicians tr vol i p              though the danger of falling was well recognized villareal testified fullbody harnesses and safety lanyards were not provided to system techs until a fiber line was cut at the office and jerome butler a technical supervisor observed all the techs working without appropriate fall protection tr vol i pp   after that incident harnesses and bungee straps were issued to the techs tr vol i p  villareal could not recall the date harnesses were issued however kenneth trujillo testified that he received his harness approximately three months prior to miskovic’s accident tr vol i p  trujillo stated that up until that time he had to use his safety belt which is used for climbing ladders and poles while working from his bucket tr vol i pp  trujillo stated that he repeatedly asked his supervisor duane moment for a harness but was told that they were out of stock tr vol i p              both villareal and trujillo testified that after receiving harnesses they were admonished at each regular wednesday safety meeting to wear the fall protection tr vol i pp   trujillo however testified that they were never shown how to use or inspect the body harness or body belt and strap tr vol pp  moreover both villareal and trujillo agreed that the technicians rarely wore fall protection prior to miskovic’s accident tr vol i pp    according to both techs it took longer to put on the harness than it did to complete most jobs so the technicians did not bother to put on the harnesses and lanyards unless they were worried about being caught without them tr vol i pp               john vallejo who worked as a line technician for marcus until may or june of  used a bucket truck to work on the main cable lines tr vol i p  vallejo stated that a body harness and lanyard were issued to his truck but that he was never trained to inspect or to use them tr vol i pp  vallejo never used the body harness which remained wadded up in his truck the entire time he worked for marcus tr vol i pp  nor did vallejo ever see the other technicians using body harnesses he testified that there was not enough time for the techs to complete their routes if they took time out to put on the fall protection tr vol i p              tony shaw worked as a line maintenance technician for marcus until january  tr vol i p  shaw testified that a body harness and lanyard were issued with his  f ford bucket truck tr vol i pp though shaw was not trained in the use of the body harness and lanyard he understood that he was supposed to use them every time he went up in the bucket tr vol i p  shaw testified that he wore the fall protection  of the time but that on  of his calls he was in too much of a hurry to get his work done to spend the time it took to don the equipment tr vol i p  shaw had on occasion seen other technicians working from aerial lifts without fall protection tr vol i p               trujillo testified that no supervisory personnel ever saw him working without fall protection because none ever came out to his job site tr vol i p   villareal stated that ervin adams was the only supervisor to perform spot checks in the field tr vol i p   to his knowledge adams never saw him working from his bucket without his harness and lanyard on tr vol i p  mr vallejo however was disciplined on february   after ervin adams saw him on a ladder without a safety strap or a hard hat tr vol i p  exh r             ervin adams who was during the relevant period the system technical manager at marcus tr vol i p confirmed that technicians received mainly onthejob training tr vol i p more experienced technicians would show the apprentice techs how to perform whatever function was called for on a particular job tr vol i p  adams testified that the purpose of the regular wednesday morning meetings was actually to discuss general concerns the safety portion of the meetings was “thrown in” at the end of the meeting safety concerns such as bee stings might be discussed tr vol i p  according to adams marcus’ safety policy required that all employees be tied off when working from a bucket tr vol i pp   adams did not know whether employees were actually provided with a written copy of the policy tr vol i p  the policy was supposed to be communicated to employees during onthejob training and in meetings tr vol i pp   adams did not go to safety meetings himself however according to adams that was the supervisors’ job tr vol i p  adams testified that he did check up on the technicians in the field but stated that the purpose of his visits was not to check on safety tr vol i p  adams did occasionally stop to ask a technician to put cones out behind his truck and adams recalled observing manuel vallejo working without fall protection on february   which led to the disciplinary action against mr vallejo tr vol i pp              duane moment miskovic’s supervisor tr vol i p  could not recall who provided miskovic with his onthejob training tr vol i p  apprentice techs were assigned to whichever more experienced technician was working during that shift tr vol i p  according to moment miskovic’s training may or may not have included the proper use of a bucket truck depending on what jobs he rode along on if the work to be done was underground work use of the bucket would not have come up tr vol i p  moment testified that the he only went out into the field when one of his technicians would call for support tr vol i p  because the technician knew when moment was coming he would always be wearing the appropriate personal gear including fall protection tr vol i p  moment was not familiar with marcus’ safety handbook or with any specific safety rule requiring that safety belts be attached to the designated attachment point of the boom whenever an employee was working aloft from aerial equipment tr vol i pp  moment did attest that manuel vallejo’s disciplinary action was discussed in the february   wednesday morning meeting tr vol i p  exh r see also testimony of ralph varnado tr vol i pp   the sign in sheet for that meeting indicates that jurica miskovic was in attendance exh r p              ralph varnado a supervisor at marcus tr vol i p  testified regarding an email he received on wednesday march   tr vol i p  exh r the email consisted of a memo regarding a charter communication employee who was observed by a miosha inspector the employee was working from a boom bucket without a harness or lanyard the employee had an “aerial platform permit” and “should have known” better exh r the memo suggested that “you get a strong message out to you employees safety meetings additional safety training if necessary and technical supervisors qc safety visits to the employees in the field sic” exh r according to varnado the email was posted in the meeting area at marcus tr vol i p  varnado testified that the email was discussed at the following april   wednesday morning meeting tr vol i pp    jurika miskovic’s signature appears on the sign in sheet for the april   meeting tr vol i p  exh r p              mr varnado testified that he made trips into the field twice a week specifically to ensure that the men under his supervision were following safe work practices tr vol i p  his men were generally aware that when he would be coming and he never found any of them working without fullbody harness and lanyard tr vol i pp              technical supervisor darrell grubbs testified that he tried to get into the field approximately once a week to make sure his crew was working safely or to offer them additional instruction tr vol i pp  according to grubbs his men did not always know he would be coming tr vol i p  grubbs stated that he never observed any safety violations serious enough to warrant disciplinary action tr vol i p  alleged violations             serious citation  item  alleges  cfr c a        at the jobsite employees have not been certified to operate the bucket on the ford f model ata serial number bv exposing employees to the hazard of falling out of the bucket to death             the cited standard provides   training employers shall provide training in the various precautions and safe practices described in this section and shall insure that employees do not engage in the activities to which this section applies until such employees have received proper training in the various precautions and safe practices required by this section    where training is required it shall consist of onthejob training or classroom type training or a combination of both the employer shall certify that employees have been trained by preparing a certification record which includes the identity of the person trained the signature of the employer or the person who conducted the training and the date the training was completed the certification record shall be prepared at the completion of training and shall be maintained on file for the duration of the employee’s employment    discussion             respondent admits that employees were not certified to operate the bucket of the ford f tr vol i pp  respondent stipulates that the only questions to be litigated are  whether the violation was properly classified as “serious” and  whether the proposed penalty of  is appropriate tr vol i p  respondent argues that the mere failure to certify that an employee has been trained where that employee actually received training cannot in itself result in serious injury or death             the citation at issue charges respondent with failure to comply with the training requirements at §c as set forth above the cited section requires that employees be trained in safe practices applicable to the telecommunications industry the citation specifically refers to precautions necessary to prevent an employee from falling from the elevated bucket of the ford f bucket truck it is clear from the evidence adduced at the hearing that respondent’s failure to produce any records certifying that mr miskovic received any training initially led to marcus’ citation under § based on the evidence adduced at the hearing however it is clear that complainant intended to charge marcus with failing to adequately train its employees to use fall protection as is required under the cited section the issue of whether jurica miskovic was adequately trained to use a harness and lanyard when working from the bucket truck was also fully addressed by respondent as the training issue was fully tried by the parties it is properly before this judge             the evidence shows that marcus provided onthejob training to new system techs having them work with more experienced technicians none of the testimony however establishes that training in fall protection was included in that training it is clear from the record that safety training was not the main focus when new technicians rode along with more experienced techs the main purpose of every trip out was to accomplish the work assigned to the experienced technician any training the apprentice technician received was incidental to the specific job to be performed thus a new technician might or might not receive instruction on the use of fall protection depending on the nature of the jobs he rode along on             nonetheless the record establishes that marcus did have a safety policy requiring the use of harnesses and lanyards while working from a bucket and that the policy was communicated to employees at regular wednesday morning meetings jurica miskovic was present for at least two meetings where the use of fall protection was discussed though uniformly eschewing the rule the testifying employees were aware of its existence the commission has recently held that an employer’s failure to enforce compliance with work rules on the job does not establish a failure to train n  n contractors inc  bna oshc   cch oshd ¶ no   in this case the record does not establish that marcus failed to provide the training required under §c only that marcus failed to effectively enforce that training nonetheless as marcus admits marcus was in technical violation of § in that it failed to certify each employee’s training penalty             this judge agrees that a failure to certify training that was in fact received by employees is not likely to result in either serious injury or death the citation therefore will be affirmed as an “other than serious” violation it is well established that in determining an appropriate penalty the gravity of the offense is the principle factor to be considered nacirema operating co  bna oshc   cch oshd ¶ no   because there is little

legislation the city of bristol is legally unable to enter the cable television business after careful consideration i agree and will prohibit the city from operating a cable system there are

made capital expenditures of  to  for its bristol system while another cable television operator comcast communications operates in the city charter and comcast do not compete in the same geographical areas of the city in this regard bristol is typical of the cable industry in that cable providers generally do not overbuild the same geographical areas in smaller markets because of the large capital cost necessary to deliver cable television the principal competitors to cable television operators are normally local television broadcasters and direct broadcast satellite services  the city has for some time provided electric power water and sewer services to its citizens and residents of adjoining areas through its department known as bristol virginia utilities the department  is operated by an entity known as bristol virginia utilities board which is not independent of the city council the city recently constructed a fiber optic network and made plans to provide cable television telephone highspeed internet and homesecurity services through this network on june   the city council approved an ordinance granting a nonexclusive franchise to bristol virginia utilities board to construct and operate a cable television system no public hearing was held with respect to this action and no prior notice was given to charter although the citys plans to provide cable television had been the subject of prior press releases and newspaper articles had a hearing been held before the city councils action charter would have appeared and voiced its opposition  the franchise that the city in effect granted to itself differs in significant ways from charters franchise in particular charters franchise contains a pole attachment fee and requirements that the citys franchise recites will be included in a laternegotiated agreement charters franchise contains a detailed definition of gross receipts in order to determine the amount of franchise fees to be paid to the city while the citys franchise does not contain such a definition  the city initially offered cable television service to a small limited number of subscribers known as beta testers and planned to roll out its general cable service beginning december   had not this court enjoined such action twentyseven charter cable subscribers have already advised charter that they will leave charter in order to obtain the citys cable service charter has had experience in other states from municipal overbuilding and generally loses from twenty to thirty percent of its subscribers to the competing municipal operator which loss is generally permanent the citys own research indicates that almost threequarters of residential and business customers surveyed in bristol in october of  expressed an interest in switching from their current cable or telephone provider to the city  b the city concedes that no provision of virginia law expressly grants it authority to engage in the cable television business it argues however that it has implied authority to do so virginia like some other states follows the socalled dillon rule named after john dillon a judge of the iowa supreme court who first proposed it in  as formulated in virginia the dillon rule establishes that political subdivisions of the commonwealth such as cities have only those powers expressly granted by state law or necessarily implied from express powers when doubtful the question of whether a municipality has a particular power must be answered in the negative the dillon rule in short requires a narrow and strict interpretation of all powers conferred on local government in virginia while the virginia legislature has authorized localities to establish and operate waterworks sewerage gas works natural or manufactured electric plants public mass transportation systems stormwater management systems and other public utilities i agree with the most recent  opinion of the attorney general of virginia that these words do not necessarily imply the operation of a cable television system since such systems have not historically been provided by virginia local government and  are clearly not within the common meaning of the term public utility that is clearly the weight of authority in other dillon rule states as noted by the supreme court of south carolina such services cannot be included within the definition of a public utility because the value and necessity of cable television is not so selfevident that this court should declare that a cable television system provides an essential service nor does the federal cable act grant any express power to localities to operate a cable system while the citys charter from the legislature authorizes it to operate a utility i reject the argument by the city that any broader scope of power is implied by that word as compared to the words public utility there is an additional statute of general application that provides localities the authority to exercise functions necessary or desirable to secure and promote the general welfare this statute is limited however to those powers granted by state law otherwise there would be no limit to the powers of a municipality if the citys argument based on this statute were correct it could legally operate grocery stores pharmacies movie theaters petgrooming businesses and more since all of these enterprises doubtless provide desirable services in  the virginia legislature adopted a statute allowing localities to offer qualifying communications services subject to the approval of the state corporation commission the city does not rely on this statute and has not sought approval by the commission for its proposed cable services nevertheless it points to the statutes legislative history showing that an earlier version not enacted contained language expressly excluding cable television from the definition of qualifying communications services relying on a declaration by william c wampler jr a virginia state senator whose district includes bristol and who was the sponsor of the legislation the city argues that the removal of the exclusion language shows a recognition by the legislature that municipalities have the existing power to offer cable services charter in turn has filed a declaration by an industry lobbyist disputing such intent  state legislative history is often of low reliability in statutory construction because of the absence of verbatim reports of debates and floor statements while the statements of a principal sponsor as to the meaning of legislation may be helpful it is those statements made to the legislature before adoption of the legislation that are relevant since such remarks may illuminate the legislatures intent in passing the bill under the circumstances i cannot find any unambiguous meaning in the legislatures exclusion of the language in question the city also cites another new provision of state law authorizing localities that operate electrical distribution systems as the city does to offer telecommunications services after obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the state corporation commission the commission is empowered to grant such a certificate to a locality that proposes to furnish local exchange telephone service in the commonwealth the new statute also provides that no locality providing such services shall acquire by eminent domain the facilities or other property of any telecommunications service provider to offer cable telephone data transmission or other information or online programming services the parties dispute the meaning of this language and i cannot find that it clearly indicates a recognition that virginia law permits localities to offer cable services  c in summary i find that the dillon rule prohibits the city from operating a cable television system it can doubtless be argued that localities in virginia ought to be freed from the restrictions of this nineteenth century legal formulation and the citizens of bristol allowed to decide if they want their local government to engage in cable television services however i might feel personally about the wisdom of existing legal rules i am bound to apply them nevertheless the city has a direct if uncertain remedy it can ask virginias general assembly and governor to adopt legislation that plainly authorizes it to operate a cable television system  d for the foregoing reasons i reach the following conclusions of law  the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this case and of the parties  an actual controversy exists as to the citys legal authority to operate a television cable system under virginia law  charter is likely to suffer actual and substantial harm in the event the city  operates a television cable system in competition with charter  the city does not have the legal authority to operate a television cable system because such authority is not expressly granted by virginia law or necessarily implied from such express powers so granted and  charter is entitled to a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the city from operating a cable television system a separate judgment in accord with this opinion will be entered herewith notes  see  usca § a west   supp  the city initially argued that charter had no standing under state law to contest the citys authority to grant a franchise to a competing cable system however the city has now expressly waived any such argument i have the duty to ascertain sua sponte the standing of a party under the constitutions grant

will be redressed by the courts decision constitutional standing is present see friends of the earth inc v laidlaw envtl servstoc inc  us    s ct   l ed d    the city has not filed a formal answer to

when doubtful the question of whether a municipality has a particular power must be answered in the negative the dillon rule in short requires a narrow and strict interpretation of all powers conferred on local government in virginia while the virginia legislature has authorized localities to establish and operate waterworks sewerage gas works natural or manufactured electric plants public mass transportation systems stormwater management systems and other public utilities i agree with the most recent  opinion of the attorney general of virginia that these words do not necessarily imply the operation of a cable television system since such systems have not historically been provided by virginia local government and  are clearly not within the common meaning of the term public utility that is clearly the weight of authority in other dillon rule states as noted by the supreme court of south carolina such services cannot be included within the definition of a public utility because the value and necessity of cable television is not so selfevident that this court should declare that a cable television system provides an essential service nor does the federal cable act grant any express power to localities to operate a cable system while the citys charter from the legislature authorizes it to operate a utility i reject the argument by the city that any broader scope of power is implied by that word as compared to the words public utility there is an additional statute of general application that provides localities the authority to exercise functions necessary or desirable to secure and promote the general welfare this statute is limited however to those powers granted by state law otherwise there would be no limit to the powers of a municipality if the citys argument based on this statute were correct it could legally operate grocery stores pharmacies movie theaters petgrooming businesses and more since all of these enterprises doubtless provide desirable services in  the virginia legislature adopted a statute allowing localities to offer qualifying communications services subject to the approval of the state corporation commission the city does not rely on this statute and has not sought approval by the commission for its proposed cable services nevertheless it points to the statutes legislative history showing that an earlier version not enacted contained language expressly excluding cable television from the definition of qualifying communications services relying on a declaration by william c wampler jr a virginia state senator whose district includes bristol and who was the sponsor of the legislation the city argues that the removal of the exclusion language shows a recognition by the legislature that municipalities have the existing power to offer cable services charter in turn has filed a declaration by an industry lobbyist disputing such intent  state legislative history is often of low reliability in statutory construction because of the absence of verbatim reports of debates and floor statements while the statements of a principal sponsor as to the meaning of legislation may be helpful it is those statements made to the legislature before adoption of the legislation that are relevant since such remarks may illuminate the legislatures intent in passing the bill under the circumstances i cannot find any unambiguous meaning in the legislatures exclusion of the language in question the city also cites another new provision of state law authorizing localities that operate electrical distribution systems as the city does to offer telecommunications services after obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the state corporation commission the commission is empowered to grant such a certificate to a locality that proposes to furnish local exchange telephone service in the commonwealth the new statute also provides that no locality providing such services shall acquire by eminent domain the facilities or other property of any telecommunications service provider to offer cable telephone data transmission or other information or online programming services the parties dispute the meaning of this language and i cannot find that it clearly indicates a recognition that virginia law permits localities to offer cable services c in summary i find that the dillon rule prohibits the city from operating a cable television system it can doubtless be argued that localities in virginia ought to be freed from the restrictions of this nineteenth century legal formulation and the citizens of bristol allowed to decide if they want their local government to engage in cable television services however i might feel personally about the wisdom of existing legal rules i am bound to apply them nevertheless the city has a direct if uncertain remedy  it can ask virginias general assembly and governor to adopt legislation that plainly authorizes it to operate a cable television system d for the foregoing reasons i reach the following conclusions of law  the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this case and of the parties  an actual controversy exists as to the citys legal authority to operate a television cable system under virginia law  charter is likely to suffer actual and substantial harm in the event the city  operates a television cable system in competition with charter  the city does not have the legal authority to operate a television cable system because such authority is not expressly granted by virginia law or necessarily implied from such express powers so granted and  charter is entitled to a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the city from operating a cable television system a separate judgment in accord with this opinion will be entered herewith notes  see  usca § a west   supp  the city initially argued that charter had no standing under state law to contest the citys authority to grant a franchise to a competing cable system however the city has now expressly waived any such argument i have the duty to ascertain sua sponte the standing of a party under the constitutions grant of power to the federal courts to resolve cases and controversies us const art iii since it is clear that charter will likely suffer actual injury traceable to the citys action and that this injury will be redressed by the courts decision constitutional standing is present see friends of the earth inc v laidlaw envtl servstoc inc  us    s ct   l ed d    the city has not filed a
