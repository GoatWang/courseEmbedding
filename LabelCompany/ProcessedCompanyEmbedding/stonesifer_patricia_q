agenda set by g host british prime minister tony blair  lifting africas burden of poverty and curbing climate change we know that the surface of the earth is warmer and that an increase in greenhouse gases caused by humans is contributing to the problem states a white house fact sheet prepared for the g summit and issued thursday this statement represents a new recognition for the bush administration which in the past has questioned the reality of global warming still a draft of the g plan to address climate change leaked to the media two weeks ago did not acknowledge that the earth is warming enclosed in square brackets which mean that unanimous agreement has not been reached was the statement our world is warming outlining his g strategy in washington on thursday the president pledged  billion over the next five years to battle malaria in africa next week at the g he said i will urge developed countries and private foundations to join in a broad aggressive campaign to cut the mortality rate for malaria across africa in half dr lee jongwook directorgeneral of the world health organization who immediately welcomed the new us pledge this initiative provides a timely and substantial boost to the global effort against malaria he said malaria casts a terrible shadow across the african continent it kills more than one million people every year most of them children in addition to the cost in human lives the yearly economic loss due to malaria worldwide is about  billion accounting for a crippling  percent annual loss in gdp growth in african countries with the approval of congress the  billion will be used to prevent and treat malaria in targeted subsaharan african countries where the mosquito borne disease is endemic president george w bush stands at the podium after being introduced at the freer gallery in washington dc on thursday by walter stern chairman of the board of trustees the hudson institute photo by paul morse courtesy the white house an

commitment to fighting poverty debt cancellation for african countries is high on the g agenda with the leadership of great britain and the united states bush said the g countries are urging cancellation of  billion in debt owed by  of the worlds poorest nations including  nations in africa for the first time bush linked environmental protection with the eradication of poverty in africa overcoming extreme poverty goes handinhand with improving the environment he said stagnant economies are one of the greatest environmental threats in our world people who lack food and shelter and sanitation cannot be expected to preserve the environment at the expense of their own survival the president quoted the late prime minister of india indira gandhi who spoke of poverty and need as the greatest polluters the longterm answer to environmental challenges he said is the rapid sustained economic progress of poor nations bush said the best way to help nations develop while at the same time limiting pollution and improving public health is to promote technologies for generating energy that are clean affordable and secure boys play in the schoolyard while a new set of solar photovoltaic panels catches sunlight on the roof of the ipolokeng school in soweta township south africa september  photo by bob mcconnell courtesy nrel he criticized those who suggest that the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet at this moment bush said about two billion people have no access to any form of modern energy blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty disease high infant mortality polluted water and polluted air bush said in the past three years the united states has helped developing countries adopt new energy sources from cleaner use of coal to hydrogen vehicles to solar and wind power to the production of cleanburning methane to lesspolluting power plants a fact sheet
