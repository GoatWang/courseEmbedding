experience title company philadelphia inquirer job details the philadelphia inquirer is a daily morning newspaper that serves the philadelphia pennsylvania area the newspaper was founded by john r walker and john norvell in june  as the pennsylvania inquirer and is the third oldest surviving daily newspaper in the united states owned by the local group philadelphia media holdings llc the inquirer has the eighth largest weekly us newspaper circulation and has won eighteen pulitzer prizes throughout the inquirers history the paper has risen and fallen in prominence the inquirer first became a major newspaper during the american civil war where the inquirers war coverage was popular on both sides after the war the papers circulation dramatically dropped but was reinvigorated by the end of the th century while founded with support towards the democratic party the inquirers political affiliation eventually shifted towards the whig party and then the republican party before officially becoming politically independent in the middle of the th century by the end of the s the inquirer trailed behind its chief competitor and lacked modern facilities and experienced staff however new owners and editors in the s turned the inquirer into one of the most prominent newspapers in the country winning seventeen pulitzers in fifteen years since then the prestige the inquirer found in the s has mostly disappeared because of cost cutting and a shift of focus to more local coverage additional professional information on sant marilyn van see sant marilyn vans linkedin profile
