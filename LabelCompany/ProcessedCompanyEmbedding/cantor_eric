education reform issues  which were a key part of cantors policy portfolio as a house republican leader in the coming months bush is expected to engage with cantor on foreign policy and ask the virginia republican to serve as a lead surrogate to jewish americans according to campaign aides news of the endorsement was first reported by politico cantor remains well liked and respected in the virginia business community and among the republican donor class in the commonwealth though many conservative activists have little affection for him but he remains the most senior republican leader

presidency looked like to the opposition he started with an outstretched hand then that changed by eric cantorjan   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story inauguration day for barack obama in  was clear cold and crisp more than a million people had come to washington and the mall was alive with a sense of hope for the country’s future i saw it from my seat on the west front of the capitol i felt the historic sense of the day and the optimism it promised as we in congress went to work that januaryshortly before that inauguration day presidentelect obama came to the capitol to meet with the republican and democratic leaders to discuss how we could work together to get the economy moving again in that meeting mr obama asked john a boehner then the house minority leader and me to provide his team with our thoughts on how to put people back to work after the severe financial crisis of  given that my party had fought hard to elect someone else to the presidency i was struck by this gesture and hopeful that it meant we could work togetherjohn and i established a working group on the recovery we knew many of the traditional republican policies had been consistently rejected by the democrats so we aimed to formulate policies that both sides could embracethe centerpiece of our plan was a  percent reduction in taxes for small businesses we believed that small businesses were going to be the engine that powered america out of the economic downturn advertisement continue reading the main story we didn’t know how the white house would receive our plan but we knew the president was wildly popular and could use the bully pulpit against us continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story news outlets along with the democrats labeled us the “party of no” but that didn’t reflect the reality our goal was to offer a viable alternative to every major piece of legislation the democratic majority put forward we wondered if the president would embrace our efforts to bridge the policy divide and if he did what that might mean for republicans in washingtona few weeks later john and i along with the other congressional leaders met with president obama at the white house to discuss our plan as well as his proposed stimulus bill bringing along a onepage outline of our working group’s recommendations i rather brazenly asked the president if i could hand it out at the meeting the president agreed and after glancing at it he said to me “eric i don’t see anything crazy in here”i was hopeful but later in the meeting when i mentioned that a stimulus package built around government spending would be too much like “old washington” the president’s tone changed he said “elections have consequences and at the end of the day i won so i think on that one i trump you”it wasn’t long afterward that we learned that nancy pelosi the speaker of the house and harry reid the senate majority leader were well on their way to having a final stimulus package drafted and they weren’t really interested in any of our ideas the obama years arguments and reflections on the president’s tenure and legacy and so it went with the year’s next significant policy debate health care reform for a long time republicans had been working on proposals to utilize highrisk pools to help patients with preexisting conditions to lower overall costs and to expand coverage in the small employer market — policies that were compatible with the president’s public goalsearly in the legislative process a senior member of the obama administration came to see me ostensibly it was to share ideas and seek a bipartisan way forward on health care reform the official presented the administration’s preferred policy approach — including mandates and the “public option” in which government would compete with private insurance plans i insisted that none of this would go over well with the republican members and as the whip i knew that the public option was a nonstarter nonetheless i was told the president and his team were intent on doing it their waythe attitude wasn’t much different in public in february  the president invited the bipartisan congressional leadership to blair house for a discussion surrounding the health care bill that the senate had passed unlike our meeting on the economy a year earlier this one was to be televised it was obvious that the session was more about creating public pressure on republicans than soliciting our ideas newsletter sign up continue reading the main

store for our country if the democrats opt for pure obstruction or if mr trump and republicans exclude the minority from policy decisions we’ll get four years of hyperpartisanship and further erosion of public confidence in our governing institutionsas americans witness the swearing in of a new president this week it’s another reminder that our founding fathers wanted elections to have

network facebook twitter google  email comment print eight months ago eric cantor was forced out of office amid charges that he had lost touch with his virginia constituents derailing the political career of the man who was in line to be the first jewish speaker of the house now he’s back story continued below at a reception tuesday night celebrating the dc office opening of his investment banking firm it was like he had never left house republican leadership speaker john boehner of ohio held court among the guests including now majority leader kevin mccarthy of california and majority whip steve scalise of louisiana deputy whip patrick mchenry of north carolina and conference chairwoman cathy mcmorris rodgers of washington plus a few house democrats and a handful of gop senators the highpowered event for moelis  co is just the latest sign of cantor’s reemergence as a political and fundraising force the former house majority leader had practically dropped off the beltway radar after unexpectedly losing his primary to tea party candidate dave brat his reputation as a political savant was battered after brat a virtual unknown trounced him despite cantor outspending him by millions of dollars now cantor is lending his name to events for  candidates reconnecting with his strong donor network giving counsel to former colleagues and hiring advisers to brief him on political happenings on capitol hill he will also be joining harvard’s institute of politics as a visiting fellow in april the virginia republican has not yet decided to throw his support behind any er according to sources close to him but he is helping possible presidential candidate new jersey gov chris christie mingle with some of the region’s biggest donors as a cohost of a meetandgreet thursday at the jefferson hotel in downtown richmond cantor’s allies insist that his return to the washington scene has less to do with future ambition for making another run at public service and more about how politics is in his dna but many republican operatives have suggested cantor could eye a statewide run in virginia or be interested in an administration slot like treasury secretary “i think this new phase is just kind of a combination of things he knows and people he knows with a new world of business and finance” said rob collins cantor’s former chief of staff “i think there is a lot of goodwill that dc has for eric and all he did and all he is going to do” also on politico jeb braces for cpac so far cantor who splits his time between washington richmond and new york has kept a fairly low profile in the press except for promoting moelis in a statement earlier this week announcing the opening of the new office cantor acknowledged his experience in washington but offered no specifics of his role “having spent a great deal of time in this area i have witnessed firsthand its diverse and dynamic growth whether you are looking at washington dc proper the northern virginia technology corridor or some very wellknown companies based in maryland these firms need innovative independent banking advice and moelis  company is well positioned to provide it” veteran republican operatives said they weren’t surprised to see cantor who was a regular on the cable news circuit return to a more visible role the timing also makes sense for cantor to reengage in politics after getting his sea legs in his new job said former virginia republican rep tom davis who served with cantor in the house “eric will find very quickly that you don’t have to be a member of congress to be an influencer” davis said “he’s got one of the best republican rolodexes in the country with a huge donor base in richmond it would make sense to not just throw it out of the window … some people pack up their marbles and go home but i think eric is helping the party without eric a lot of these donors wouldn’t be coming to the table” cantor was wellknown for prolific political fundraising — building a national power base of loyal donors on wall street and with jewish republicans and while he no longer has his sights set on being the next house speaker his political brand still holds cachet his event with christie comes after cantor was spotted at the potential  contender’s holiday party in december at the governor’s mansion according to christie supporters who attended also on politico lynchs immigration roadblock but christie isn’t the only presidential hopeful who has reached out to cantor wisconsin gov scott walker has also sought policy counsel from cantor and is continuing to talk with him though there is no plan for an event according to a source familiar with conversations the christie meet and greet comes just a week after cantor was expected to headline a fundraiser along with jeb bush for a money event benefiting the republican state leadership committee also at the jefferson hotel cantor canceled because of snow but the event still drew many of his longtime supporters including richard cullen chairman of mcguirewoods llp and former attorney general of virginia “he is eager to see the party get the best candidate to take back the white house” cullen said adding that although cantor has not declared which  contender he will back his support could be key for any of candidates “he would be a great person to have in your camp — he’s incredibly bright he understands the nuances of national politics and has a great number of people who like him and might follow him” also on politico carson kicks off cpac cantor remains extremely popular among wealthy richmondarea donors still recovering from his loss “i like eric and believe he is good honest and very smart and that his political loss was also a loss for our region” said one of cantor’s former donors steve markel vice chairman of financial holding company markel corp another indication of cantor’s return to washington neil bradley who served as cantor’s policy director will return as a formal policy adviser after cantor’s defeat he had held a similar post in mccarthy’s office cantor is also staying close to his former congressional colleagues mchenry who was close to the former house majority leader when they served together said he continues to call on him for advice “just as when he was in the house he knows the process and the players and has deep knowledge on a range of policy issues i consider him both a mentor and a friend” the north carolina republican said besides mchenry and other members of house gop leadership former colleagues who attended moelis’ dc opening reception were national republican congressional committee chairman greg walden of oregon republican sens tim scott of south carolina cory gardner of colorado and shelley moore capito of west virginia and house democratic reps sheila jackson lee of texas carolyn maloney of new york and peter welch of vermont walden also said he has continued to talk with cantor although the virginia republican doesn’t have any campaign committee fundraisers on the books yet cantor remains engaged with the young guns network the outside group supporting house republicans that has ties to the former congressman and could also be helpful to  congressional and presidential candidates through his leadership pac every republican is crucial which is sitting on more than  based on its yearend fundraising reports it has not given any money to candidates since his primary loss but the pac continues to spend on staff salaries and vendors including allen consulting and creative direct — firms affiliated with cantor’s former top political adviser ray allen allen declined to comment on the plans for the leadership pac but john murray a former cantor leadership aide who now works as a public relations consultant and adviser to cantor at moelis said cantor’s recent moves are just the first steps of his involvement in the upcoming cycle “i don’t think for a second he is going to sit out of the  cycle in terms of not engaging with someone and also continuing to engage with his friends and colleagues from his former life” he said john bresnahan contributed to this article correction an

country of free speech so decency is also a part of this” now after cantor’s historic defeat in the republican primary tuesday an entire party is picking through the wreckage of his campaign trying to understand what went wrong some republicans spent wednesday working on conspiracy theories indulging the idea that there was no way they could have seen this coming maybe some said voters secretly and suddenly turned on cantor because he is jewish or maybe it was the “cooter effect” that was the theory that cantor lost because democrats came out to vote against him — following a plan laid out in an “open letter” from an obscure excongressman ben jones who played cooter the mechanic on “the dukes of hazzard” jones had served as a democrat from georgia before moving to virginia and running unsuccessfully against cantor in  the answers to those questions are likely no and no instead a look back at cantor’s defeat shows that it was a real rejection by a broad swath of his district’s republican voters and there were warning signs that it was coming the heckling of cantor in that convention speech and defeats of his acolytes in lowlevel party elections this year but cantor missed those signs for far too long — focusing on his ambition in the house while his base crumbled beneath him then when he realized there was some danger he reacted clumsily launching an ad blitz that was supposed to destroy his opponent but actually left him looking like a legitimate alternative in the confrontational gop culture that cantor had helped create the highest measure of a conservative was that powerful interests wanted to destroy him now cantor was signaling here was such a man “they really created their own nightmare in a lot of ways but eric cantor has been creating his own nightmare for years” said jamie radtke cofounder of the virginia tea party federation and a brat volunteer from hanover county va of cantor radtke said “he made an enemy of his friends” cantor  has been in congress for more than  years now but in all that time his only close election was his first one the  republican primary which he won by less than one percentage point since then he had always won big in some years he faced no primary opponent at all when virginia’s districts were redrawn in  the state’s legislature altered cantor’s district and removed some heavily democratic precincts in the richmond area they swapped in heavily republican new kent county east of the state capital cantor supported the move which was supposed to make his safe seat even safer from democrats but that was a miscalculation cantor had misjudged where his real threat would come from a threat to cantor was already growing within his own party in which some tea party members had begun to conclude that he was not conservative enough for them in  cantor seemed to affirm that impression skipping the state’s first tea party “convention” where attendees cheered lustily for his opponent in tuesday’s primary the same forces unseated him — the more republicans who showed up the worse off it was those new voters from new kent county turned sharply on cantor and he performed worse there than in all but one of the counties he represents “ironically new kent was given to cantor in redistricting to help him out instead it backfired” said michael mcdonald a political science professor at george mason university when this election began it looked like a mismatch no majority leader from either party had ever been defeated in a primary cantor seemed unlikely to be the first he raised more than  million and outside groups also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on cantor’s behalf brat  an economist at randolphmacon college in ashland va had never held elective office before he had little money — he raised about  — and little backing even from tea party groups “i mean it’s a miracle” brat told fox news’s sean hannity on tuesday night seemingly stunned at the victory himself “first of all i attribute it to god” but brat was not as helpless as he first seemed he had key allies on conservative talk radio like hosts laura ingraham and mark levin they talked him up to listeners giving brat a free way into virginians’ homes and cars ingraham also campaigned for brat in person holding a huge event on june  at a tennis and golf club not far from cantor’s own home outside richmond inside the twostory atrium and balcony were so packed that don blake chairman and president of the virginia christian alliance said he struggled to document the evening “it was so crowded you could not get a decent shot i could see her through other people she was great the crowd loved her” said blake who didn’t endorse a candidate before the primary he added “she just was so personable and down to earth she spoke from the heart” “who do you think barack obama and nancy pelosi want to win this primary” ingraham asked the crowd cantor the crowd replied “why do they want eric cantor to win they want eric cantor to win because eric cantor is an ally    in the fight for immigration amnesty” beyond that kind of large rally brat’s supporters tried to set up a basic ground game making phone calls and knocking on doors “everyone assumed this race had no legs yet we knew we had a really great candidate” said nancy smith a brat supporter from henrico county “and we knew there was a lot of anticantor fervor around the district” smith said the volunteers found something interesting unlike in much of the rest of the country the top issue for voters was not the economy smith explained life in virginia was pretty good for most th district residents — the stock market was on the rise and they weren’t in financial panic mode but she said they found that many republicans in the district were still unhappy with cantor he had voted to raise the debt ceiling and he had supported a republican version of the dream act which would enable some illegal immigrants who entered the country as children to qualify for instate college tuition rates “cantor’s votes started to be the driving message” smith said as months passed there were some worrying signs for cantor one of his allies lost a race for the position of district republican chairman despite an expensive blitz from cantor’s campaign cantor’s campaign paid  apiece in postage to send personalized trinkets to party loyalists and on convention day the committee bought up all the hotel’s conference rooms to stymie brat’s supporters they even provided day care for the kids of their own supporters cantor’s candidate got beaten and cantor got heckled on the same day but in the incumbent’s camp they dismissed what turned out to be a major warning sign “there were  people there to raise cain” cantor strategist ray allen told the washington post afterward “we had  voters in the primary two years ago it’s just a very quantumleap different thing” cantor’s team tried to reinforce its advantage with tv ads attacking brat calling him a liberal college professor who’d been appointed to an advisory panel by democratic gov timothy m kaine va cantor spent at least  producing and airing television ads according to federal filing reports he began with a small buy in late april then dramatically expanded the tv campaign in midmay but the ads repeated brat’s name again and again alerting many voters to the fact that he existed at all — and that he seemed to threaten cantor to cantor’s people it seemed this was working in late may an internal poll showed cantor ahead of brat by  points according to cantor aides on wednesday pollster john mclaughlin said the poll was flawed — but in a way that he could not have known then in an interview mclaughlin said the people polled were those who had voted in past republican primaries the poll did not anticipate that on tuesday so many more people would show up he suggested that many democrats and others who haven’t voted in previous primaries came out on tuesday “polls don’t predict turnout you’re trying to make assumptions of who usually votes” mclaughlin said “here eric got hit from the left and the right and it created a large turnout” around the district there was a perception among some republicans that cantor had grown distant “i wouldn’t say he’s been here a lot and the thing is he hadn’t had too many wideopen big events” said bob arment the chair of the republican party in louisa county va arment said that when cantor did visit his district he tended to hold “invitationonly” events limited to people who were already known supporters or gop bigwigs arment said that voters told him “they hadn’t seen cantor they’d like to see him when’s he coming to louisa county” did that hurt cantor in the election “i’m sure of it” arment said in the last days before that election cantor’s camp began to worry that not enough of its supporters would turn out so cantor went out to rally his people he held meetandgreet events at three of richmond’s largest businesses manufacturing firm meadwestvaco holding company markel corp and law firm mcguirewoods cantor wanted to reach his traditional core voter persuading whitecollar professionals to turn out on the final weekend of the race cantor also met supporters at the homes of loyalists but he reached only a small swath of a huge district and met largely with people who were already in his camp “the congressman told me as he left my house — we’ll be okay if we get out the vote” said alan kirshner the chief executive of markel corp who hosted a party for more than  cantor supporters at his home in doswell on sunday as the campaign wound down even mclaughlin got a sense that cantor might be in trouble but “by then it’s too late to poll” he said then came tuesday itself cantor started the day at a capitol hill starbucks holding his monthly fundraising coffee with lobbyists around  am in this case he was raising money for three junior lawmakers — building the kind of loyalty that would help cantor ascend to the speaker’s chair when john a boehner rohio retired over coffee cantor assured the group of  or so that he would win he had spent heavily he told them with the intention of getting a big margin so he would “show no sign of weakness” cantor went to the capitol where he met with republicans in a caucus meeting then as usual he oversaw the gop operation on the house floor cantor cast  votes the last one at about  pm at some point in the late afternoon cantor headed down interstate  to richmond for his victory party already the first hints of real trouble were filtering in to his campaign headquarters turnout was much higher than usual his pollster said at  pm the polls closed and results began to come in it was quickly apparent that cantor would lose a few moments later he appeared on another hotel room stage in richmond “i know there’s a lot of long faces here tonight” cantor told the crowd “it’s disappointing sure but i believe in this country i believe there’s opportunity around the next corner for all of us” then he climbed into a sportutility vehicle and left into a life wildly divergent from the one he’d lived that morning on wednesday afternoon cantor was asked at a capitol hill news conference what had happened to cause his sudden fall “you know i’m going to leave the political analysis to y’all” cantor said

every member of the house under house rule xxii clause  to be granted privilege to call for a vote this amendment to the house rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since cantor refused to allow the senates continuing resolution to be voted on in the house journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the senates version of the

api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in

for the american people that we can actually improve the outlook for bringing down costs in health care eric cantor health i am american people have to take responsibility for themselves we need to get the housing industry going again we dont need government intervening in every step eric cantor responsibility step people whether its people walking off the view when bill oreilly makes a statement about radical islam or juan williams being fired for expressing his opinion overreaching political correctness is chipping away at the fundamental american freedoms of speech and expression eric cantor walking political american in a perfect world we would bring corporate tax rates down to  or less so we can get competitive in the world economy ultimately i would love to see a flat tax eric cantor love world perfect we believe that if you put in place the mechanisms that allow for personal choice as far as medicare is concerned as well as the programs in medicaid that we can actually get to a better result and do what most americans are learning how to do which is to do more with less eric cantor learning believe better the issue for us is rebuilding a governing majority that is comfortable with differences that can transcend the divisiveness and unify behind the principles that we know our party has succeeded on eric cantor know party principles what the president announced yesterday is that somehow magically if we just continue to prime the pump of taxpayer dollars were going to see magically an economic recovery eric cantor yesterday recovery see it is time for us to insist that we are accountable for the money that we are spending eric cantor time money accountable weve had town hall meetings weve witnessed election after election in which the american people have taken a position on the presidents health care bill and the bottom line is the people dont like this bill they dont want it eric cantor health meetings american we have a plan that creates universal access programs at the state level which allows folks to access insurance if theyre denied by their insurer eric cantor plan insurance level i mean look nancy pelosi said in the very beginning this is going to be the most open honest and ethical congress in history and what were seeing is shes breaking that promise every day eric cantor history day beginning and basically the sense of the pledge to america is this republicans understand when we were in charge we got fired in  we spent too much money we defied the trust that the people had put in us and we know that there is a better way eric cantor trust money america we as republicans understand that we have got to protect these entitlement programs  these entitlement programs for our seniors today and we have to sit down and have a discussion we need more ideas on the table eric cantor today ideas down look we know we screwed up when we were in the majority we fell in love with power we spent way too much money  especially on earmarks there was too much corruption when we ran this place we were guilty and thats why we lost eric cantor love money power we will cut programs we will try to rein in the size of the bureaucracy we will bring federal pay scales that have become so exaggerated into line with market rates eric cantor try bureaucracy line we know that appropriators will fight these cutbacks but by eliminating earmarks we can stop the horse trading that grows agency budgets eric cantor horse fight know well if democratic members in the house elect nancy pelosi as their leader its almost as if they just didnt get the message from the voters this election i mean the voters outright rejected the agenda that shes been about and here theyre going to put her back in charge eric cantor leader election house i am not for raising taxes in a recession especially when it comes to job creators that we need so desperately to start creating jobs again eric cantor job i am start i mean the obama position has been we think government ought to be spending this money not the people who earn it eric cantor money government people you know we have a fiscal train wreck before us and unless we act and act deliberately were not going to enable our kids to have what we have its plain and simple as that eric cantor simple train know its all about the fungibility and money if planned parenthood accesses hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money and they use that for other purposes then they can use other dollars to fund abortion eric cantor money abortion then you know there are people making a lot of money in this country who can actually afford their own health care we are in a situation where we got a safety net in place in this country for people who frankly dont need one we got to focus on making sure we got a safety net for those who actually need it eric cantor money health focus the republicans have put together serious detailed counterproposals when we have objected to this administrations agenda and so i want to tell the president and remind him again were not voting no for political expediency weve got our principles and were going to stand up and defend those eric cantor together political want but as weve seen over the last several months the people in this country are very dissatisfied with the direction that this administration is taking this country and what we heard last night was absolutely the ignoring of that fact it was were going to continue with this agenda in fact were going to double down on healthcare eric cantor night people direction now the proposal is yet again another  billion before we start to think about a freeze but  billion spent on more government programs monies being created to direct and what kind of jobs that washington thinks ought to be created come on i mean there is a government that can help and the government can also hurt eric cantor hurt government start we believe very strongly that you stop that denial of coverage by promoting choice let people make the decisions eric cantor decisions believe people share this page cite this page citation find on amazon eric cantor related authors
