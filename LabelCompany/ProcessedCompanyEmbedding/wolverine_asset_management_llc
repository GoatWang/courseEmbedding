reached the point of our threatening to nominate a competing slate for the board that any tangible response to our concerns occurred second yesterdays market response shows clear skepticism over the adequacy of your plan for restoring lost shareholder value and curing the problematic status quo that exists at jmi today we have delivered to the company a formal notice of our nomination of a slate of six  highly qualified director candidates for election to the board at jmis  annual meeting of shareholders the  annual meeting  we have taken this step because we have grown increasingly concerned with the direction of the company under current leadership specifically we hold the view that management cannot deliver value through continued operations based on the foregoing i a consistent record of underperformance  ii a fee structure that is in direct conflict with shareholder interests despite amendments announced in yesterdays press release and iii conflicts of interest within management and the current board given the small size of the company and limited set of options our analysis suggests the best valueenhancing outcome for shareholders at this point would be to liquidate the portfolio and distribute the proceeds to shareholders  our director candidates are committed to considering any actions that would lead to shareholder value maximization up to and including full liquidation consistent record of underperformance the latest quarterly results show that jmis book value has dropped by  since the october  ipo  total return on book value has been  over the same period   this compares to an average total return of  for its peer group  a  underperformance is astonishingly disappointing given the similarity of assets furthermore this underperformance has been consistent as jmi has underperformed its peer group average in  out of  quarters and based on the companys recent disclosures and our estimates yet again in the current quarter our expectation would be that an asset management contract is terminated or investor capital fully redeemed on the back of such dismal performance  investors have an entrenched board and shareholderunfriendly structure to thank for armour capital management lps acm continued role in mismanaging the jmi portfolio  photo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh the story is worse for jmis share price the stock has dropped  from  at ipo to  as of  adding back dividends results in a total return to shareholders of  in the three years since ipo compared to a  average for the peer group over that same period photo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh fee structure that is in direct conflict with shareholder interests in this period of dramatic underperformance management has reaped a windfall  management fees have become excessive as a percentage of shareholder equity  the management fee is calculated as  of gross issuance proceeds net of share buybacks which effectively means the manager receives a constant dollar amount regardless of performance  this structure runs counter to shareholder interests in two ways i if the book value declines from losses the effective fee as a percentage of shareholder equity rises and ii there is a disincentive for management to repurchase shares as it reduces the management fee  the  drop in book value since ipo has resulted in the  fee ballooning to  of current book value making jmis the highest management fee in the sector as a direct result of having the worst performance administrative expenses have also increased as a percentage of the declining equity since many of the costs are fixed  using the average of the previous four quarters expenses and most recent quarterly book value the current administrative expense rate is  per year  combining this with the  management fee results in an untenable total fee and expense burden of  creating an additional  basis points of drag on investor returns relative to the peer group average of  we held discussions with the management team in may  in which we specifically highlighted our concerns about the fees and expenses while seven months should have been ample time to implement a fee structure less deviant from industry norms it was only after an investor filled out an approximately page nomination package that the board was spurred to action optically your agreedupon management fee rebate to  of total stockholders equity trims jmis untenable fee structure toward your peer average yet the fee rebate is subject to retraction at the sole discretion of acm without any input from the board additionally it is structured as a rebate rather than a topline reduction which means that the egregious termination fee for acm would remain unchanged at an astonishing  of book value the fact that such a change was only made once wams intention to nominate a full slate became clear makes us skeptical that any part of these supposed shareholderfriendly actions will remain in place without continued exhaustive pressure from one or more large shareholders the reduction in board member expenses is similarly discretionary and equally easy to repeal once shareholder pressure eases conflicts of interest within management and the current board we are also highly concerned with conflicts of interest among the board as well as the manager  the four nonindependent directors on the board each has an economic participation in the management fees through partnership in the external manager and thus a strong incentive to vote against share repurchases or any other action that might reduce the size of the feepaying asset base  additionally acms agreement for managing the much larger and higher feepaying portfolio of armour residential reit inc raises the question of time allocation attention and focus on jmi jmi shares currently trade at around  of book value based on recent company disclosures and share price on   at such a deep discount every share bought at  when combined with  in net asset sales results in a  gain on book value or a  return on invested capital  this type of instantaneous return vastly outweighs any expected returns from investing in mbs at full value we have met and spoken with jmis coceos who are also board members several times since may   in each instance we voiced our concerns over the poor performance significant discount to book value and the need to take action that would create value for shareholders  we expressed our desire for significant share repurchases and a rationalization of fees and expenses to a sustainable level  after a wholly inadequate  of outstanding shares were repurchased in mid there have been none in the past five months  performance has continued to deteriorate and shares have continued to trade at  of book value  management has repeatedly stated on earnings calls and in direct conversations that they do not intend to repurchase shares due to concerns about repo counterparty relationships and operational scale  the only thing to date that has remedied this intransigent behavior has been the threat of our severe step of nominating a competing slate to assume control of the board the december  announcement of an expansion in the share repurchase program if it is actually executed is a stunning reversal from company comments just a few short weeks ago if the company failed to exercise this option when it was authorized to repurchase up to  million shares how can investors expect different behavior just because the board increased the repurchase program to  million shares it is hard for any investor to believe that either management or the board is truly considering his or her best interests if any suggestion not attached to a proxy is met with calculated dismissal liquidation and recovery while share repurchases at the current discount to book value creates exceptional value for shareholders the concerns about size and scale are not without merit  shrinking the company further would also exacerbate the problem with administrative expenses  however to continue on the current path will likely lead to further book value erosion and subpar performance which would likely result in an even greater share price discount resulting in a downward spiral for shareholders  due to its small scale the company must be willing to consider all alternatives including a full liquidation of the company if that is the only credible path towards maximizing shareholder value  unfortunately the boards direct economic interest in maintaining the status quo has led to an unwillingness to even consider this or other valueenhancing options for example liquidation would result in recovery of approximately  of book value for shareholders after factoring in the excessive management termination fee  as well as execution and administrative costs   in our recent discussions management noted a similar estimate of  using the most recent company updated book value estimate of  our estimate would result in liquidation proceeds of  per share  this would provide shareholders a  gain over the recent share price of  management has repeatedly stated that the overall portfolio is small enough that shrinking it further would cause the company to become irrelevant to its counterparties we agree with that assessment fortunately for jmi investors the small size of the portfolio mitigates the concern that trades taken to unwind the portfolio might be large or awkward enough to have an outsized secondary market impact the current situation is unsustainable without further and more drastic action the market will continue to price jmi shares at a substantial discount to its potential value under alternative approaches nominating a slate of director candidates is an extraordinary step for us but we cannot allow the valuedestructive status quo to persist  we remain prepared to continue our dialogue however if we cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution we are fully prepared to solicit the support of our fellow shareholders to elect six new board members who are committed to representing the best interests of all jmi shareholders

activities he heads the firm’s investment committee and is also cofounder of wolverine trading where he has been the driving force behind its successful growth commenting on market conditions over the

across the board “success in  required prowess in the specific selection of securities as a greater percentage of the convertible universe moved from more creditsensitive to more equitysensitive” he says adding that managers who were able to hedge implied volatilities probably had an edge in performance the wolverine convertible arbitrage fund employs various strategies to supplement the capital structure strategy that represents twothirds of the fund’s risk the firm’s portfolio managers use a proprietary screening process when looking for mispriced securities to value layers of a firm’s

arbitrage and various volatilitybased strategies with respect to risk management wam’s goal is to achieve consistent returns while minimising idiosyncratic risks through diversification gust
