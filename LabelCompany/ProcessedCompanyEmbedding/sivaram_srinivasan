about this book in early  i was attempting to develop a cvdbased tungsten process for intel at every step ofthe development information that we were collecting had to be analyzed in light of theories and hypotheses from books and papers in many unrelated subjects thesesources were so widely different that i came to realize there was no unifying treatment of cvd and its subprocesses more interestingly my colleagues in the industry were from many disciplines a surface chemist a mechanical engineer a geologist and an electrical engineer werein my group to help us understand the field of cvd and its players some of us organized the cvd users group of northern california in  the idea for writing a book on the subject occurred to me during that time i had already organized my thoughts for a course i taught at san jose state university later van nostrand agreed to publish my book as a text intended for students at the seniorfirst year graduate level and for process engineers in the microelectronics industry this book is not intended to be bibliographical and it does not cover every new material being studied for chemical vapor deposition on the other hand it does present the principles of cvd at a fundamental level while uniting them with the needs of the microelectronics industry show all table of contents  chapters introduction sivaram srinivasan pages  preview buy
