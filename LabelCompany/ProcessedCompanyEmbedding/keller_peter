particle removal down to  microns customer feedback we installed the first skimmer package on a large matsuura to check the performance and the results were excellent the sump was clean and the oil drained from the keller skimmer was solid oil it eliminated coolant wasteron mfacilities manager at paramount machine “…for a modest investment the two pfa units have allowed me to increase shop throughput avoid unscheduled shutdowns eliminate parts finish problems and greatly reduce labor costs for sump maintenance…”steve dpresident and founder of csi manufacturing “i have cut my waste generation from  drums per month to two drums per month since i installed the keller tko units in addition i have increased production by minimizing downtime which helps us meet our customer deadlines by removing the tramp oil my coolant is less likely to foam and filtering out the aluminum means i am less likely to plug coolant lines in my machines the keller units paid for themselves in a few months i’m glad i kept looking for the right solution to this difficult problem”peter jmanufacturing manager at stanfordville machine “the magnetic separators are working great we clean them about every  hours or so and have been very pleased with the results”jonathan saj rose manufacturing company “…the pfa is rugged and easy to use it works exactly as described with neglible operating cost and has eliminated several costly problems no more pumping out sumps no more problems of fines affecting parts finishes no more short runs with high pressure coolant filter…”mike cmarox corpwhy keller

storiespayout calculations running with clean coolant is a major cost saving initiativepayout calculations running with clean coolant is a major cost saving initiative the tko standing next to the sump requires only  x  floor space the tko mounted on the machine tool with the magnetic frame uses no floor space the clo magnetic frame for the tko attaches to the machine tool without hardware until a few years ago interest in maintaining the cleanliness of coolant in machine tool sumps arose chiefly from inshop environmental concerns odor was a problem there was smoke in the air or operators were suffering from contact dermatitis–all problems attributable to tramp oil in the coolant however while the environmental issues continue to be important in the current difficult economy most shop managers recognize intuitively that maintaining clean coolant in the machines is essential for running an efficient and profitable shop after all if machine tools ran just as well with dirty coolant as with clean coolant no one would ever change coolant however despite the general agreement that clean coolant saves money it is a rare shop manager who has actually calculated the cost savings resulting from maintaining clean coolant in the machines and the savings are quite significantthe cost savings result from the following improvements in shop operationsa good coolant maintained regularly with an efficient pumpskimmer unit can run at least one year in the sump before it should be changed with no skimmer or with an inefficient belt or disc skimmer the coolant must be changed every two months or six times per year therefore with efficient coolant maintenance annual coolant purchase and disposal costs are reduced by five changeouts per year or in addition reducing coolant changeouts from six per year to one per year will similarly reduce by  the labor required for changing the coolant and the machine downtime during coolant changeoutsrunning with clean coolant significantly reduces tool wear compared with running with dirty coolant based on feedback from hundreds of shops a conservative estimate for the benefit of clean coolant is a  saving in tooling costthe following cost savings are calculated for one machine with an  gallon sump the reduction in coolant changeouts will save five changeouts per year or  gallons of coolant in the sump per year the concentration of coolant makeup is assumed to be  savings per yearcoolant makeup  of  gal or  gal  galcoolant disposal  galyear  gallabor for changeouts  manhrschangeout  manhrsyear

time for pumpskimmer  years or  months we can cite the example of pv engineering salisbury ma to illustrate the fact that cost savings and improved shop efficiency are now the driving forces in the decisions by shops to install efficient cooling cleaning equipment pv engineering founded in  is a familyowned shop serving the defense power generation and medical markets they employ  cnc machines primarily machining stainless steel after analyzing his shop’s operation peter vlismas vice president of pv concluded that ineffective coolant maintenance was having a detrimental effect on the performance of his shop he contacted keller products inc a leading supplier of coolant cleaning equipment and cited the following specific objectives “minimize waste run cleaner and improve profits” since keller has more than  coolant cleaning units operating successfully in shops and the cost estimates suggest a potential saving by pv of more than  per year the keller salesman quickly reached an agreement with peter vlismas to initiate a test program pv installed a tko pumpskimmer unit at the sump of one machine in common with all keller pumpskimmer units the tko pulls oily coolant from the surface of the sump filters to remove suspended solids separates the tramp oil from the coolant with the patented keller maintenancefree separator elements and returns the cleaned coolant continuously to the sump at high flow rate in contrast to the belt skimmers that pv had previously tried a keller pumpskimmer with a ″ airoperated diaphragm pump turns over a sump rapidlyfor example a  gallon sump will be turned over twice per houraerating the coolant and ensuring that there are no stagnant areas of the sump in which oil and solids can accumulate the separator may be run when the machine tool is operating or is idleafter running the tko about one month peter vlismas decided to equip his entire shop with keller units keller supplies three models of tko units to accomodate any shop space constraints the tko which has a footprint of ″ x ″ could be conveniently set on the floor adjacent to seven of his  machines for the remaining  machines peter selected the tko with the clo magnetic frame which can be mounted off the floor directly to the machine tool and requires zero floor space in operation the tko performs exactly like the tko the keller units have been operating for more than six months the evaluation from peter vlismas “coolant waste has been greatly minimized the machines run cleaner and more efficiently and the shop is more profitable the keller units installed easily without interruption of shop operations all my objectives for the program have been achieved at relatively low cost and with no operating problems”conclusion maintaining clean coolant is an important lean manufacturing initiativenew pumpskimmers eliminate dirty coolant bottleneck in precision machine shopnew pumpskimmers eliminate dirty coolant bottleneck in precision machine shop stanfordville machine contiuously invests in the latest in machine tool and tooling technology the tko separator is mounted to the machine without hardware using the magnetic frame note the floating inlet device the clean coolant in the sump and the dark band of collected oil in the separator tank the bag filter conveniently removes the large quantity of floating aluminum chips before the oily coolant is pumped to the separator tank stanfordville machine stanfordville ny founded in  is a leading supplier of precision parts to the semiconductor medical aerospace and electronics industries running a busy shop with  machines stanfordville management continuously invests in new machines in order to ensure just in time deliveries and to be working with the latest in machine technology at all times however peter johnsen manufacturing manager found that his objectives for the long term investments in tools and tooling were being compromised by lack of effective maintenance of the coolant in his machine sumps buildup of tramp oil and other impurities in the coolant required frequent pumpouts of the sumps resulting in excessive coolant and waste disposal costs and more important unacceptable unscheduled machine downtimestanfordville machine pursued some typical approaches for keeping the coolant clean they tried skimmers with no success a skimmer operates only in a small area of the sump leaving most of the sump covered with oil and removes a large quantity of coolant along with the tramp oil they next tried a pumping separator with an electric pump the electric pump immediately proved to be unreliable and the overall construction of the separator was not rugged enough for the stanfordville applicationpeter johnsen then contacted keller products acton ma which he knew to be a leader in coolant cleaning systems for sumps under  gallons with over  units in the field the rugged keller pumpseparators are specifically designed for troublefree service with ” airoperated diaphragm pumps and patented permanent oil separating coalescing elements that require no maintenance keller offers both dedicated and portable units to handle any shop requirement since peter did not want to require his crew to move portable units the keller salesman recommended the tko line of pumpseparators designed to service individual sumpsa tko skimmer pumps oily coolant from a floating inlet device on the surface of the sump through a prefilter to remove floating chips and into a separator tank containing the keller permanent separator element the separated tramp oil is held in the tank until drained whenever convenient the cleaned coolant recycles continuously to the sump at high flow rate the high recirculation rate turns over the sump rapidly ensuring that there are no stagnant areas in which oil and solids can accumulate the smallest unit in the tko line the tko can be mounted to the side of the machine tool without hardware using the keller magnetic support frame clo this feature was especially important to peter since it kept the aisleways clear for stock movementhe ordered two tko units with magnetic frames and evaluated them for one month they performed exceptionally well stanfordville primarily machines aluminum which generates a large quantity of floating fines that are pulled into the separator along with the tramp oil although the tko separators are equipped with a cartridge type prefilter as standard peter requested that keller supply the units with a high capacity bag filter for added operating convenience even including the bag filter and the ” air operated pump the keller system was more economical than the unreliable pump separator previously evaluatedthe result of the test was total customer satisfaction peter johnsen then ordered identical units for his remaining machines he says “i have cut my waste generation from  drums per month to two drums per month in addition i have increased production by minimizing downtime which helps us meet our customer deadlines by removing the tramp oil my coolant is less likely to foam and filtering out the aluminum means i am less likely to plug coolant lines in my machines the keller units paid for themselves in a few months i’m glad i kept looking for the right solution to this difficult problem”precision valve manufacturer improves productivity dramatically with model  separatorsprecision valve manufacturer improves productivity dramatically with model  separators shop manager roger poirier displays one of conval’s high pressure globe valves used worldwide by the power generating industry portable keller model  pumpseparator can be set up at a sump simply with two quickdisconnect fittings the model  can clean a typical sump in a few hours keller floating inlet device automatically compensates for changes in sump height note that the treated coolant is oilfree conval inc somers ct founded in  manufactures high pressure globe valves used primarily in the power generating industry the fact that conval exports about  of its output is testimony to the worldwide reputation for quality and reliability its valves have achieved in this extremely demanding service the valve bodies are machined from forgings primarily steel plus some aluminum bronze and stellite on  cnc machines operating two shifts because the shop has been extremely busy over an extended period of time roger poirier shop manager is constantly evaluating all areas of shop operation to find possible gains in productivityone source of continuing production problems was contamination of the coolant high levels of tramp oil and solids in the coolant flooding the working part caused rapid tool wear according to roger “the rapid tool wear required frequent machine adjustments during a run in order to maintain conval’s tight dimensional specifications even with these adjustments the amount of rework on outofspecification parts was bogging down our delivery schedules in addition we were pumping out and changing our sumps every six weeks” the reduced throughput on the machines and the loss of machine time for pumpout convinced poirier that he had to act to deal with the coolant contamination problemroger was referred to keller products inc acton ma by his coolant supplier keller products is a leader in sumpside coolant cleaners with thousands of units in service the keller salesman surveyed the shop and quickly determined that one of keller’s five standard portable pumpseparator units model  could be recommended to solve the conval coolant contamination problem the cartmounted model  pumpseparator unit can clean a typical  gallon to  gallon sump in a few hours and then can be easily moved and set up at the next sump keller recommends that each sump be treated once per week since the model  can readily treat two sumps in an  hour shift one separator can maintain the cleanliness of the coolant in  or more sumps all keller separators incorporate selfpriming air operated pumps no electricals a bag filter to remove floating solids that enter the separator with the oily coolant and patented permanent oil separator elementsroger poirier purchased one model  and the results were dramatic he states “on the first couple of machines we removed  to  gallons of tramp oil in a few hours the bag filter removes the fines associated with machining forged material we are currently going on nine months with coolant in the sump and there is no indication yet that the coolant will need to be changed any time soon tool life has increased substantially the need to make machine adjustments during a run has dropped sharply and rework due to coolant issues has been virtually eliminated not to mention the savings associated with eliminating downtine and disposal of coolant for pumping out  cnc machines every six weeks” about one month after installing the first model  poirier purchased a second unit to ensure that all  conval sumps will be kept free of tramp oil and floating solids noting that the dramatic improvements in shop operations were achieved with the modest investment in the keller units and without interrupting normal operating procedures poirier says his only regret is that he did not address the coolant problems soonertwo keller model  tramp oil separators keep sumps of  cnc machines cleantwo keller model  tramp oil separators keep sumps of  cnc machines clean model  coolant purifier is an essential component in the stevens manufacturing program for maximizing shop efficiency two keller coolant purifiers cleaning tramp oil from each of  sumps every other week have increased coolant life from  months to one year in addition to benefiting machine efficiency the removal of tramp oil by the keller purifiers eliminates the source of smoke and odor in the shop air and helps overall housekeeping as shown by the above illustration of the exceptionally clean stevens shop model  portable unit with a small bag filter and large oil separation section is a good choice as a tramp oil separator for sumps with moderate floating solids and a large quantity of tramp oil model  operating continuously on one sump makes a clean split of tramp oil from coolant even with a slow separating coolant portable model  containing a large bag filter and large oil separation section is used for sumps with a high tramp oil content and a high loading of floating chips for example when cutting aluminum model  with the large separator tank can cleanly separate tramp oil even when a large quantity of oil is present well before “lean manufacturing” had become the standard term for efficient manufacturing stevens manufacturing co milford ct a supplier of precision parts to the aerospace aftermarket was implementing the principles of lean manufacturing with its ongoing process improvement programs in fact steve fogler jr shop manager credits stevens’ success in maintaining its competitive position during difficult times to its emphasis on continually upgrading the processesone aspect of the operation to which steve has devoted continuing attention is maintenance of the coolant stevens runs  cnc machines none older than  years cutting everything from plastics to steel to titanium in relatively short production runs their customers such as boeing sikorsky and the u s government set extremely tight dimensional and surface finish specifications tramp oil and other contaminants in coolant greatly increase the difficulty in meeting the tight specifications high levels of tramp oil in coolant cause accelerated tool wear degradation of parts finish and the requirement to adjust machine settings frequently to achieve the dimensional specifications in addition tramp oil in the coolant generates smoke in the shop plus odor and the potential for operator dermatitis as a consequence of bacteria attack on the oil also when cutting relatively low density materials such as plastics and titanium the chips which remain suspended in the coolant are picked up by the coolant pump and sprayed onto the working part compromising the surface finish in order to maintain product quality and achieve production targets stevens was dumping coolant and recharging with new coolant every three months the cost was substantial––not only the cost of new coolant and disposing of about  gallons of spent coolant for each of  machines every three months but also the roughly four hours of labor per machine to drain and clean the sump and replenish the coolant in addition each machine is down during coolant changeoversteve fogler recognized that the coolant problem had to be solved in order to improve shop efficiency and reduce costs it was clear that belt or disc skimmers a conventional method for removing tramp oil from sumps would not address the stevens requirements because a skimmer does not create circulation in a sump and therefore is ineffective on larger sumps and a skimmer does not reduce the quantity of solids suspended in the coolant to improve the situation significantly stevens required a coolant purifier which would separate tramp oil efficiently recirculate the coolant at high rate even when the machine tool is idle and filter to remove suspended chipsin  stevens purchased a coolant purifier supplied by keller products inc lexington ma which met all these requirements with the new purifier coolant life was immediately extended from  months to one year after recently adding several new machining centers stevens purchased a second keller coolant purifier the model  separator steve fogler says “the money saved on hauling waste coolant and buying new coolant by greatly extending the coolant life is only a small part of the savings the biggest saving is in the labor and downtime to dump clean and recharge the sumps of  machines every three months”a keller coolant purifier operates by pulling oily coolant from the surface of the sump via a compact inlet device and then through a high capacity bag filter to remove suspended solids the coolanttramp oil mixture free of solids is pumped through the patented keller oil separator elements which are immersed in a plastic tank the permanent oil separator elements constructed from stacks of plastic discs with fine flow passages efficiently split oil from coolant at high flow velocity creating the opportunity to design high flow rate separators in compact packages the cleaned coolant is continuously returned to the sump and the tramp oil collected in the separator tank is drained to a waste oil container periodically usually once per day a sump typically can be cleaned in a few hours and then the pumpseparator can be easily moved to another sump and set up to run in about five minutes the keller separator which requires only a inch compressed air line for operation can be run while the machine tool is operating or when shut downdespite the fact that the model  is the largest separator in the keller line capable of treating individual sumps up to  gallons it requires only ” x ” of floor space and is easily portable with a coolant recirculation rate of  gallons per hour a model  can clean a  gallon sump in less than two hours steve fogler says “i can easily cover the whole shop with the two keller units i run for about one or two hours every other week on each sump and the coolant looks like swimming pool water” the resulting operating benefits are improved machine efficiency extended tool life better parts finish and greatly reduced machine downtime another advantage to operating with clean coolant obvious to any visitor is the overall cleanliness of the stevens shop and the absence of smoke in the air which can be caused by tramp oil in the coolantsteve fogler says “to stay competitive i have to stay lean and to me lean means minimizing time spent on nonvalueadded projects lean isn’t about not spending money and it is not always about exotic new machines or programs sometimes lean is just making sure your existing assets are operating at maximum efficiency our coolant maintenance system is an important element in our ongoing program to maximize operating efficiency”  large floating inlet device works perfectly even in the presence of floating aluminum chips  compact floating inlet device in a typical installation sweeps

exclusively they utilize  swiss cnc machines an okuma mill two cnc turret lathes and a mazak mill all machining with cutting oil hayn engineers found that the condition of the cutting oil was contributing to some difficult quality and production problemsaccording to ted beger supervisor of the machine shop fragments from the machining process were accumulating in the oil and the these fragments were embedding in the ss during various machining operations the result was thread galling and parts rusting in addition the fragments in the cutting oil were in turn accelerating the wear on the tooling leading to poor tooling life and abbreviated filter life in the bag filters on the high pressure coolant systemswhile researching possible solutions to the problem of contaminants in the cutting oil hayn engineers visited a trade show exhibit of products by keller products inc keller supplies complete lines of equipment for filtering and purifying cutting oil and waterbase coolant the particular keller unit of interest to the hayn engineers was the pfa a portable pumpfilter unit which is designed to remove solids from cutting oil or coolant in machine tool sumps without the need to pump out or shovel out the sumps the pfa pumpfilter unit contains a rugged high flow rate airoperated diaphragm pump and a high capacity bag filter which removes solids as fine as  micron mounted in a frame on a compact cart with a recirculation rate of  gallons per minute the pfa completely cleans fines and chips from a typical sump in minutes and then is easily moved to another sump and set up to run simply by connecting a ″ compressed air line with no electricals the unit is inherently fireproof the selfpriming pump pulls the cutting oil from the sump through a large diameter vacuum hose into the bag filter and continuously pumps the filtered liquid back to the sump at high flow velocity the force of the filtered liquid discharge scours the bottom of the sump and keeps chips and fines suspended in the oil for pickup by the inlet hose because the oil is not drained from the sump during the brief cleaning operation the machine tool need not be taken offline for solids removal routine maintenance on the pumpfilter unit consists of changing or emptying the filter bag when the pumping rate slows in many applications the filter bag may be emptied and reused a number of timesthe hayn engineers purchased one pfa to service all twelve machines in the shop ted beger reports that with the pfa in service tooling life has improved by  to  percent the galling and rusting problems have been virtually eliminated so that they now have no scrap due to contaminated cutting oils the filter bag life in the high pressure systems has tripled he says that all these improvements were obtained at relatively low pumpfilter unit operating ted beger says ‘the pfa was a low cost and convenient solution to difficult and expensive quality and production problems i would recommend

metals including steel brass and aluminum csi a partner in a group of eight companies in new england and europe offering one source turning solutions operates  cnc machines  hours per day  days per week steve doody president and founder of csi says that the intensive production schedule while desirable for the health of the business presented him with some nagging operating problems because of the volume of relatively small parts running steadily in the machines the concentration of small chips and fines in the oil increased rapidly to interfere with machine performance the small chips were entering the gundrills causing tool breakage and loss of finish on parts leading to unacceptable reject rates and unscheduled machine stoppages the resulting cleaning of the machines led to further downtime and also put additional burdens on the housekeeping crew since steve prides himself on a clean and orderly shopsteve discussed the problem of solids buildup in the oil with his swiss machine supplier the supplier knew that customers had successfully addressed similar problems using the keller products pfa pumpfilter unit and recommended that steve contact keller the pfa can clean suspended solids and settled sludge from a sump in about  minutes or less without the need to pump out the machine tool it contains a high capacity bag filter to filter as fine as  microns and a pump which recycles up to  gallons per minute of clean oil to the sump since the pump is driven by compressed air and there are no electrical components the system is inherently fireproof an important benefit when processing straight oils mounted on a ″ x ″ cart the easily portable pfa is wheeled to the side of the sump the inlet and outlet hoses are positioned in the sump and a shop ” compressed air line is connected setting up at a sump requires about  minutes the dirty oil is pulled from the sump through the  ″ inlet hose filtered by the bag filter and continuously returned to the sump the force of the clean discharge can be used to scour the bottom of the sump to resuspend settled solids for pickup by the inlet line the sump is never emptied and the machine tool can run for extended periods without additional maintenancesteve doody purchased one pfa and he reported that the problems he was having with solids in the sumps were virtually eliminated csi operates the pfa for a few hours every day to clean each of the  sumps about once per week as a result of this simple and inexpensive cleaning schedule steve doody says “machines can complete their scheduled runs unattended quality problems have been eliminated and tool life is greatly extended our production efficiency is much improved because we no longer have to shut machines down to service the sumps in addition to these quantifiable improvements the operators appreciate the elimination of a very unpopular task and i appreciate the fact that we have less oil to clean off the shop floor”steve doody was pleased to learn of an additional application for which the pfa is well suited he found he could use the portable pumpfilter to remove suspended solids from the oil reclaimed from the chip spinner which is typically loaded with fines the selfpriming pump on the pfa allows steve to pump the filtered oil from the chip spinning process into a gallon drum which he then moves through the shop to top off machines with oil as neededwith the number of machine tools in service at csi and the versatility demonstrated by the keller pfa steve doody purchased a second unit to ensure that his shop maintenance needs are being met to summarize the impact of the pfa on his shop steve says “in my opinion this is the perfect example of the application of lean manufacturing initiatives––specifically the elimination of nonvalueadded time my shop was built on the concept of being able to produce parts automatically only to be challenged by solids buildup in the oil then for a modest investment about  each the two pfa units have allowed me to increase shop throughput avoid unscheduled shutdowns eliminate several problems relating to part finishes greatly reduce labor costs associated with sump maintenance and improve overall shop cleanliness and working conditions considering the investment in topline cnc machines tooling and producing the part itself ensuring that we run with clean oil

buildup of chips and sludge in the sumps of the machines bradford operates  cnc’s  mills  lathes and  edm machines cutting primarily aluminum and exotic steels john therrien shop manager says “on the milling machines chip buildup in the coolant caused the pump to clog and cut off coolant flow also chips packing in the sump could result in coolant overflow onto the floor on the smaller sumps it takes four hours to pump out the coolant shovel muck from the bottom of the sump wipe down the machine and pump back fresh coolant on the large mill it’s an eight hour project since the mills are operated two shifts five days per week shutting down for  to  hours for a complete cleanout was done only when absolutely necessary on the lathes the buildup of fines in the coolant adversely affected the surface finish and required replacing the coolant every few months plus the cost of waste disposal is constantly increasing”therrien’s objective was to find a method for cleaning out the solids without the need for shoveling out the sumps he tested an airdriven vacuum head fitted on a  gallon drum although the device removed the coolant from the sump it left behind a considerable quantity of solids in the corners of the sump in addition it used so much compressed air that the air pressure at the machines fell below the low pressure alarm level therrien also considered a large portable filter and vacuum tank system but decided that it would be impractical in the tight spaces of his shop the problem of buildup of solids in the sumps remained unsolved until therrien learned that keller products inc lexington ma who previously supplied an efficient tramp oil separator to bradford had introduced a new pumpfilter unit pfa which looked promising as a practical solution to the problemthe pfa incorporates a high capacity bag filter and a high flow rate airoperated diaphragm pump mounted on a compact ” x ” cart the mixture of coolant and solids is pulled through a large diameter inlet hose into the bag filter which removes all solids as fine as  microns the filtered coolant is returned to the sump under pump pressure at  gallons per minute the force of the pressurized liquid discharge scours the bottom of the sump and keeps chips and sludge suspended in the sump for pickup by the inlet hose the pfa can clean settled and suspended solids from a typical sump in  to  minutes the machine tool is shut down during the brief cleaning period but there is no need to take it off line in contrast to the  to  hours of machine downtime required to pump the sump dry and shovel out the solids with only a inch compressed air line connection no electricals the cartmounted pfa– may be moved to another sump and set up to operate in minutes the only maintenance required is to empty or change the filter bag when the pumping rate slows when filtering relatively dry solids such as aluminum chips the filter bag may be emptied and reused multiple times a new filter bag costs  bradford is using water soluble coolants but the pfa is equally effective removing solids from cutting oilsbradford has been using the keller pfa to maintain the sumps in all the mills and lathes since last year john says “we now clean each of the sumps in rotation as needed usually once in three or four weeks during scheduled friday afternoon maintenance we can do a quick cleaning in  minutes or a more complete cleaning in about  minutes by pulling the conveyor the cleaning operation is usually a one man job” because there is essentially no holdup volume in the pfa the unit may be rotated among different coolants without mixing john therrien has concluded “the use of the pfa has eliminated machine inefficiencies caused by excessive solids in the coolant eliminated unscheduled machine downtime for sump cleanouts greatly reduced the man hours devoted to coolant maintenance and completely eliminated the unpopular task of shoveling solids from the sumps” needless to say both shop management and shop operators are very pleased with the performance of the pfahigh precision shop solves the problem of solids buildup in screw machine cutting oil with portable

demonstrate both to their customers and their employees that meticulous work and total attention to cleanliness are essential elements of their products in fact brian rosenkranz likes to say that his customers would not feel out of place coming from an operating room into his shopmarox has  new cnc screw machines which utilize cutting oil as the working fluid and  cnc millers with waterbase coolant buildup of solids in the cutting oil in the screw machines was causing major problems in shop housekeeping obviously a serious concern for marox as well as generating significant costs for unproductive labor and machine downtime as described by michael consolmagno vice president of the marox cnc turning unit the problems caused by buildup of solids in the sumps of the screw machines particularly critical with the new design machines arechips and fines plug the coolant pump inlet screens causing the low flow alarm to shut down the machinea high concentration of fines in the coolant loop compromises the finish on precision partswhen the high pressure coolant pump is utilized about  of the time solids rapidly plug the filters in the high pressure loop requiring frequent machine shutdowns to change the filter baguntil recently the only solution that marox had to the problem of excessive solids in the oil was to shut down the machine and manually rake and shovel the solids from the sump the economic costs for this nonproductive and unpopular function are the machine downtime and the use of skilled labor even in the new screw machines the sumps are not readily accessible for solids raking or shoveling mike consolmagno estimates three hours of machine downtime and labor to clean one sump in addition to the economic costs the manual sump cleaning and chip handling unavoidably produced oily deposits that challenged the marox scrupulous housekeeping programthe problem of solids buildup in the sumps was solved literally overnight when the salesman from keller products inc lexington ma introduced to mike consolmagno the new portable pumpfilter unit pfa the keller pfa can clean settled and suspended solids from a sump without the need to drain the sump or shovel the solids the pfa contains a high capacity bag filter and a high flow rate airoperated pump mounted on a compact ” x ” cart with the inlet and outlet hoses inserted in the sump the mixture of solids and oil is pulled into the bag filter which removes all solids as fine as  microns and the filtered oil is continuously returned to the sump under pump pressure at  gallons per minute the force of the pressurized liquid discharge scours the bottom of the sump and keeps chips and sludge suspended in the sump for pickup by the inlet hose the pfa can clean settled and suspended solids from a typical sump in  minutes or less requiring only a ” compressed air line for operation no electricals the cart mounted pumpfilter unit can be moved to another sump and set up to run in minutes the only maintenance required is to empty or change the filter bag when the pumping rate slows or stops replacement filter bags cost  each the selfpriming diaphragm pump has a suction lift of  feet and can be run dry or deadended without damagemarox now utilizes one pfa to service all nine cnc screw machines mike consolmagno says that treating each sump with the pumpfilter unit for about one hour each week eliminates the screen plugging and parts finish problems associated with solids buildup in the sumps and at the same time completely eliminates the messy and time consuming pumpout and shoveling operations now the machine tool is not taken off line for the sump cleaning since marox uses two types of cutting oil mike particularly likes the feature that the selfpriming pump on the pfa completely drains the bag filter on the separator after a sump is treated so that the next sump can be treated without mixing oils he also points out that although on many of the machines access to the sumps is severely limited the  foot lengths of both the inlet and outlet hoses and the fact that the pump on the pfa is selfpriming permit quickly setting up and operating the unit on even the most difficult sumps without significant sump modificationsmarox also uses the pfa to reduce the solids load on the high pressure filter when the high pressure oil pump is operating the pfa is set up with the inlet hose positioned in the sump remote from the high pressure pump inlet and the outlet hose discharges filtered oil into the vicinity of the pump inlet with the pfa operating in conjunction with the high pressure pump the solids load in the high pressure pumping circuit is greatly reduced and the time between bag changes on the high pressure filter is significantly increasedto sum up the benefits of the keller unit mike consolmagno says “the pfa is rugged and easy to use it works exactly as described with negligible operating cost and it has eliminated several costly problems no more pumping out and shoveling out sumps no more problems of fines affecting parts finishes no more short runs with the high pressure coolant filter and with one pfa it is far

unfortunately they experienced frequent unscheduled machine downtime as a result of plugging in the coolant delivery lines of two new vertical machining centers which are equipped with ” to ” lines to feed the throughthespindle coolant and five coolant nozzles loss of coolant flow automatically shuts down the machines which often run unattended the coolant line plugging problem was particularly troublesome when machining titanium because the light titanium fines which float in the sump are picked up by the coolant pump and pumped into the spindle and coolant nozzle lines maintenance found that about every two weeks the fines would pack into the coolant delivery lines and back up ” from the discharge nozzles and spindle it was then necessary to shut down the machine pull off all the nozzles and bellows covers and clean the lines this operation is performed by a man in a cramped space in the machine for  to  hours obviously not a popular job for the machine operator more important for management each of the two machine tools was offline for  to  hours every two weeks when every production hour was urgently neededthe shop maintenance supervisor recognized that it should be possible to alleviate or even eliminate the plugging problem by filtering out the solids downstream from the pump before the line splits into the coolant distribution manifold since he was quite satisfied with the performance of two portable pumpseparator units to remove tramp oil from the coolant he had previously purchased from keller products acton ma he decided to contact keller for a possible solution to the coolant line plugging problem the keller salesman immediately recommended the model xs– stainless steel and brass filter housing containing a  micron keller permanent cleanable filter element the rugged housing about ” diameter by ” high with ” inlet and outlet ports is easily installed by the shop in the coolant delivery line the keller proprietary permanent filter element which fits all standard cartridge filter housings has a much higher flow rate at low pressure drop than a similar size disposable filter element the cleanable filter element is constructed of thin plastic discs with precisely sized grooves mounted on a plastic core the large internal filter surface area provides excellent solids holding capacity and long runs between cleanings when cleaning is required the element is removed from the housing and the discs separate to a stop on the core the allplastic element can then be cleaned in a bucket of water by washing with a hose or in a parts cleaner any shop cleaning agent or solvent can be used the keller filters with permanent elements available in ratings from  mesh to  mesh  micron and flow rates to  gallons per minute are ideal for any throughthespindle or throughthetool applicationsthe xs– assemblies were installed in the coolant line on each of the two machines a spare cleanable filter element was purchased for each filter housing the result the coolant line plugging problems have completely disappeared the  to  hours of unscheduled downtime per machine every two weeks have been eliminated and the machines can run unattended without danger of shutdown because of loss of coolant flow the only filter maintenance required is to remove the dirty filter element and replace it with the clean standby element once every two weeks a task of about  minutes the dirty element is then cleaned and stored for the next cycle the maintenance supervisor says “the keller filters completely eliminated unacceptable machine downtime and the machines are now running at maximum productivity the filters are relatively inexpensive and were easy to install the keller filters are a simple solution to a difficult production problem”pumpseparator for coolant management viewed as production enhancement toolreprinted from manmodern applications news april pumpseparator for coolant management viewed as

pumpfilter separator unit can keep clean up to  sumps in rotation note the layer of tramp oil in the separator tank a  gallon per minute portable pumpfilter separator unit may be positioned permanently in tight quarters at a single sump the elimination of “monday morning odor” reducing coolant waste and improving inshop working conditions are frequently sufficient reasons for installation of coolant cleaning equipment and coolant management programs however jonathan strauss sales manager keller products inc lexington ma maintains there are major production and profit benefits that also may be gained“three of the most expensive items in the shop are the machining centers the tooling and the part they are cutting and the coolant is in contact with all three” advises strauss he adds that inshop experience has shown that degradation of the coolant will result in abbreviated tool life poor parts finish excessive downtime for machine maintenance and frequent coolant pumpout “relatively lowcost coolant cleaning equipment can address all these problems” says straussas shops invest in highpressure coolant systems and throughthespindle cooling it is more important to view coolantcleaning equipment as an aid to productivity because clean coolant is less likely to foam in these applicationsfor small sumps belt and disctype skimmers adequately perform the task of tramp oil removal however for large sumps or sumps with heavy loads of tramp oil or solids a pumpseparator unit that incorporates a filter may provide additional benefits a pumpseparator unit continuously recirculates the coolant filtering suspended solids and separating tramp oil a typical unit consists of an inlet device positioned in the sump to pull oily coolant primarily from the sump surface a prefilter for solids removal an airoperated diaphragm pump and a tramp oil separation sec tion a unit like this may be run when the machine tool is operating or shutdownpumpseparator units may be permanently installed to serve a single large sump or a portable unit may be rotated among several machine sumps to clean each sump at least once a week a single portable unit capable of serving multiple machines makes the coolant cleaning investment more attractive for many shops coolant testthe first step in selecting a pumpseparator unit explains strauss is to determine the oil rejection properties of the coolant being used “the better a coolant rejects oil the easier it is to keep clean and the longer it can be maintained in the sump” he notes “a fresh coolant with good oil rejection characteristics will readily splitout the tramp oil or way oil to the surface of the sump if the coolant is allowed to stand for  minutes” april  wwwmodernapplicationsnewscoma floating inlet device pulls oily coolant into the separator from the sump surface and automatically compensates for changes in sump liquid level when aluminum is being machined the inlet device and separator unit must be capable of handling a large quantity of suspended solids one model  foreground and one model  background maintain all sumps in one shop one model  keeps sumps of  machines clean in a precision machine shop  compact floating inlet device in a typical installation sweeps tramp oil from the sump surface a simple fieldtest of the condition of the coolant is to take a sample of the coolant from the sump while it is running and allow the sample to stand for  minutes oil that separates to the top of this sample will be removed by an efficient pumpseparator unit only a fraction of the oil that remains dispersed or emulsified in the bulk of the coolant after  minutes will be removed by a pumpseparator or a skimmer unitbecause the oil rejection ability of any coolant diminishes over time a good recommendation is to select a separator specifically designed to work with slowseparating coolants “rather that trying to reclaim spent coolants” suggests strauss “the better approach is to start with fresh coolant and maintain it properly”the size of the circulating pump on a separator is determined by the size of the sump for sumps up to about  gal a unit with a recirculation rate of  galhr should be sufficient larger sumps may require units capable of  galhrthe materials being machined also have a major impact on the type of separator to be used “if the shop machines more than  combined of materials that produce a large quantity of suspended solids such as aluminum cast iron brass copper plastics and titanium the pump separator unit should be equipped with a highcapacity prefilter usually a bag filter to protect the pump on the separator and prevent buildup of sludge in the oil separation section” says straussby viewing coolant management as a production enhancer rather than solely an environmental improvement option shops can more accurately gauge whether this approach is costjustified“a regular coolant management program can greatly increase tool life improve parts finish reduce downtime due to untimely pumpouts and improve the overall condition of the machining center” stresses strauss keller products incportable pumpfilter unit solves difficult and costly
