financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures including adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda all references to tons are short tons of  pounds ill now turn the call over to dave honeyfield david w honeyfield thanks will and thanks to those joining us today to learn more about intrepids third quarter  results the third quarter was good for us as we continue to make progress on our large capital projects and we continued to strengthen our operating practices during the third quarter we realized a  per ton improvement to our net realized sales price per potash and  per ton improvement for trio and had solid sales of both potash and trio during the quarter we earned  per diluted share on net income of  million and our adjusted ebitda was  million which helped fund our capital investments as well as grow our cash and investment position to  million as of september  the outlook for potash remains positive as we see fall harvest drawing to a close and farmers beginning to prepare their soils for the  season crop economics for us farmers have remained strong in light of the continued tight domestic stocktouse ratios for both corn and soybeans dealers entered the fall with healthy inventory positions and should be turning over their inventories during the fall application window the current market scenario is completely different from what we saw last year at this time when dealers entered the fall of  short of inventory and scrambling to get caught up to meet farmer demand dealers presently are well stocked with inventory and there is some sideway selling among a handful of traders seeking liquidity of their positions that being said potash pricing from a producer perspective is flat which we would expect until a replacement of inventory by dealers resumes and ultimately the fundamentals of the positive crop economics are reflected in the market the value of balance fertilization is well understood and is acknowledged by farmers as the key to generating strong yield on their investments in land equipment seed and fertilizer the increase in our average net realized sales price per potash to  per ton in the third quarter was achieved despite the weather challenges faced by some of our customers in particular we faced continuing drought conditions in texas and delays in shipments of several committed orders due to high water on the missouri river our sales and marketing team has done a great job of expanding our reach and leveraging the flexibility of our production assets to keep tons moving albeit with some higher freight costs in certain cases we believe that strong crop economics will continue to incentivize farmers to apply nutrients at a normal rate this fall in preparation for the  season the marketing flexibility weve created through our ongoing investments in granulation capacity positions intrepid to meet what we believe will be strong domestic agricultural demand over the next year during the quarter we made great progress on our capital investments with our langbeinite recovery improvement project moving closer to completion with progress being made on our wendover compaction plant and warehouse and the continued forward movement on our hb solar solution mine project the consistent objective of our capital investment program is to deliver a reliable production stream of highquality product and a grower production with incrementally lower cost tons were within  months of seeing an increase in our langbeinite production through improve recoveries at a time when the demand for our trio product is as good as ever hugh will go into more detail on some of the projects but before he does i just want to reiterate that each of our projects whether theyre the headline projects listed above or smaller projects such as the installation and commissioning of the distributor control system that occurred in carlsbad during that third quarter are each building blocks that provide the foundation for growing our production and driving efficiencies throughout our business hugh harvey will take the call from here hugh e harvey thanks dave our potash production of  tons in the third quarter of  represents a  increase relative to the third quarter of  and was in line with our expectations during the quarter we had very good performance from our west and wendover facilities we also began the harvest in midseptember from our moab solar solution mine following the summer evaporation season at our east facility we performed the annual scheduled turnaround maintenance during which we tied in the new fluidized bed dryer a portion of the lrip project to the existing plant we are pleased to report that the new drying system will be handed over from the engineering department to the operations group very soon at our east plant we experienced some reduced production ahead of the scheduled turnaround there were a couple of pieces of equipment that required maintenance ahead of the planned work the result was higherthananticipated production cost from our east mine during the quarter going forward we continue to anticipate that our annual cash cost of goods sold net of byproduct credits will be in the range of  to  per ton as we have said throughout the year we produced  tons of langbeinite during the third quarter of   excuse me  tons of langbeinite during the third quarter this compares to  tons produced in the third quarter of last year we are looking forward to increasing our recoveries of trio with the commissioning of dense media separation portion of the plant during the fourth quarter we also anticipate having the granulation plant placed into service during early  i am pleased to report that we are right on budget with the lrip project as we described in our earlier press release we will continue to invest in and build increased capacity and flexibility into our production system with the approval of the new north compaction plant this new more efficient plant is designed to accommodate all of the production from the expansion of our mining and milling operations at our west facility together with the anticipated production from the hb solar solution mine the current schedule for receiving the record of decision from the blm for the hb solar solution mine remains on track for the first quarter of  as we move closer to the expected record of decision date we have updated the project cost estimates to incorporate the changes in scope to accommodate alternatives described in the draft eis as well as to consider cost updates for labor piping equipment and numerous other elements of the project the board of directors recently approved the updated authorization for expenditure associated with the hb mine to an estimated  million to  million of capital investment of this  million has been invested to date the capital authorization was based on the evaluation and conclusion that the product continues to be an important and financially attractive investment that fits within our overall business strategy of increasing productivity and decreasing our cash operating cost per ton during the third quarter we also commissioned a new mine panel at our west mine which increased the capacity of the underground mine we expect to see some more benefits from our new mine panel at the east mine in the first quarter of  as touched on earlier we also completed the installation and commissioning of our distributed control systems and related instrumentation at both our west underground mine and our surface mill at the east plant in wendover utah we are progressing with construction of a new compaction granulation plant which has the designed capacity to compact all of our production from this facility the majority of the steel has been erected and we expect the new system will be in service by the end of the year as planned in addition the construction of the new product warehouse in wendover is progressing on budget and should be in service in early  our total capital investment for  is expected to be towards the top end of our previously disclosed range of  million to  million now ill turn the call over to kelvin feist our senior vice president of marketing and sales kelvin g feist thank you hugh as noted our sales results in the third quarter were very good we sold  tons of potash which compares to  tons of potash sold in the third quarter of  a time when dealers were stocking a nearly empty supply chain additionally due to the success of the moab compactor project and the increased granular capacity we have been able to expand our supply to new markets and strengthen the relationships with customers in these regions we also sold  tons of trio as compared with  tons of trio sold in the third quarter of  the strong sales volumes for trio and the strong demand that we are operating  we are operating with virtually no inventory cushion the benefits of the increased recoveries and increased granulation capacity from lrip comes at a great time as there is a growing demand both domestically and internationally for our sulfate of potash magnesia product that we market as trio as dave highlighted the potash market has been stable over the last couple of months the average net realized sales price we earned in the third quarter for our potash was  per ton and  per ton for our trio harvest in the united states began in earnest in the first half of october and has intensified in recent weeks we understand that many of our customers purchased their potash requirements for the fall season during the summer as dealers demonstrated their willingness to build the potash inventory into the fall of  we also expect that these inventories will be drawn down as farmers prepare their fields for the  crop given the economic returns that farmers should realize this year we expect farmers will apply the necessary potash during the fall application window to maximize yields with that i will turn the call back over to dave to provide some final remarks david w honeyfield thanks kelvin the third quarter of  showed that the investments weve made in improving the flexibility of our business are paying off as weve highlighted earlier the next couple of quarters for intrepid will be extremely important for the growth of our business going forward the completion of the langbeinite recovery improvement project and the receipt of the record of decision for the hb solar solution mine will put intrepid on the trajectory of continued success by growing our production with incrementally lower cost ton we believe that our ability to effectively fund and execute on our significant capital investments together with the strength weve shown in our marketing and have built into our operations positions us well to benefit from the strong agricultural environment well now open up the lines for any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question today comes from bill carroll of ubs bill carroll  ubs investment bank research division how does the increased level of capital spending for the first phase of the hb mine expansion affect future capacity expansion cost there that is is there a certain amount of upfront in infrastructure spending related to this first phase that wont need to be spent as you further expand the mine in future years david w honeyfield bill i think what weve described before is that we have increased the amount of our pond capacity is one of the items that weve touch on with regards to hb and clearly the cost estimates include the piping the pumps to all areas and well have the mill already built so i think weve got the appropriate infrastructure certainly looking forward there but as we mentioned we really contemplated some of that pond capacity expansion which i think sets up well for us bill carroll  ubs investment bank research division and in the event that operating cash flow doesnt cover capex over the next few quarters how would you expect to finance the shortfall would you draw down cash or tap your revolver or a combination of both and are there any limits on capex in your revolver covenants david w honeyfield certainly its a fair question and i think if you look at the cash balances and investment balances that we have and you look at cash flows thats what were expecting to utilize to fund the capital investments so as we look forward we think that those recover by cash on hand and by cash flows and as you know we finalized the updated credit facility thats a  million credit facility there are very typical financial covenants in there but certainly no limitation on capital providing that the financial ratios are adequate which we  the amount of cushion there is pretty darn significant right now operator the next question comes from edlain rodriguez of lazard capital markets edlain rodriguez  goldman sachs dave quick question i mean in terms of like the inventories like the dealers inventories how closely are you monitoring those customers’ inventories to the extent that you can and also do you get a sense that they stock in inventories ahead of price increases or just more confident that the end demand is going to be strong kelvin g feist edlain ill take that one its kelvin feist here in terms of inventories we do monitor it with our large customers i guess were just getting into our application season so they were very full and were just starting to see a drawdown on those inventories as were moving forward here i guess from our perspective we are watching these because were seeing a fair bit of a ill just call it sideways trade with some of these dealers resellers in the marketplace and that inventory needs to go to ground and then were going to start seeing a replenishment and i guess thats really what were waiting on here to allow us to move forward here and get closer to our reference pricing that we have on our  out of carlsbad fob david w honeyfield edlain this is dave as well i think what id add is we still get  were still getting very positive feedback from dealers that they expect this to be a good fall so what i would try to take away from our comments is that its  were passing along information and theres still a high level of confidence and were just making sure that you all know what were seeing out there edlain rodriguez  goldman sachs okay and on  a good question on langbeinite i mean production cost went up quite a bit this quarter i mean remind us again what cost a big increase and also should we expect those higher production cost to stay around for the next several quarters or so david w honeyfield edlain this is dave we touched on it a little bit in our press release and then also in the call here we had the scheduled turnaround at the east mine and if you remember all of our langbeinite production comes from the east facility so when were down for a period of weeks at the east mine we still end up incurring a lot of the cost and actually increased maintenance costs during those turnaround cycles the other thing we touched on and id ask you to focus on is that we really sold through virtually all of our langbeinite inventory as of the end of the third quarter so the  tons that we sold included quite a bit of standard product at very good prices as the export market has strengthened so theres not very much inventory that carries into the future periods so we fully expect to be at pretty normal rates again here during the fourth quarter and well see the benefit of some of the increased recovery from the dense media plant so id really look back to the first couple of quarters in  and that should be a much more normal type cost of goods sold for the company operator the next question comes from mark connelly of clsa mark w connelly  credit agricole securities usa inc research division just a couple of things obviously the cost with the east maintenance were up a little bit and thats not really much of a big deal and you did point out that theyll trickle through with inventory and all that but are the actual cost of productions back down to where there were at this point david w honeyfield im sorry mark what reference point are you comparing against mark w connelly  credit agricole securities usa inc research division im just looking at east before and after the maintenance here are we back down to where we would have been prior to that project on cost or is there any escalation in cost david w honeyfield no i think any escalation on cost that you see is going to be purely inflationary related and we expect to see the ninth mining panel come in during the fourth quarter it will be late in the quarter so well really start to see that benefit coming through next year i think what i would ask people to focus on when youre building your models as hugh mentioned we still anticipate that our annual cash cost of goods sold for potash will be somewhere in that  to  range the numbers for the first couple of quarters were below that were pretty close to that number net of byproduct credit here in the third quarter so what that tells you mark i think like you recognizes that we will have higher cash cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter as some of that inventory moves through the system but its not something that i expect to see on a goforward basis so hopefully that answers your question mark w connelly  credit agricole securities usa inc research division yes thats perfect and it answered my second question which was about when that panel was coming in so thats perfect just one more question im not asking you to forecast prices in trio but im just curious how tight you see that market versus regular potash david w honeyfield kelvin kelvin g feist yes i guess mark theres  its very tight i guess we as dave indicated sold down to a very low level lowest in history weve got demand from both international and domestic thats extremely strong today so were really working hand to mouth here whatever we produce were able to sell and so its much tighter i think weve done a great job of creating a demand in some key markets and its  i guess more of a specialty product that seems to be gaining some traction so very popular in todays economics with some of these farmers and i think were going to continue to see that strength as move forward into the fourth quarter and beyond operator the next question comes from don carson of susquehanna financial group sandy h klugman  susquehanna financial group lllp research division this is sandy klugman sitting in for don a couple of quick questions one are you finding that your canadian competitors are acting more aggressively in the domestic market given the significant delta between domestic and offshore potash prices i mean  could you estimate to what extent the drought in the southern plains and floodrelated rail disruptions decreased third quarter shipments david w honeyfield sandy this is dave ill start and kelvin if there are additional items to cover please jump in but its always been a very competitive market and i think as you see certain capacities come on with the canadian producers i would expect to see that competition probably increase throughout the united states so i dont know really that theres a whole lot more to add on that front and then on  kelvin do you want take the second half of that kelvin g feist ill take the third quarter question and the weather situation i guess the way i see it it was more testing our abilities on our transportation and logistics side of things as we increased our footprint it into a ill call it an expanded geography this last quarter i guess its a small impact on our realized price but really its a weigh average calculation so its not an easy thing to get to a specific number for us but i think its fair to say that we probably expanded our rail freights by  in order to a  compared to our other rail options in order to move that tonnage so i mean both texas and the missouri river did have some impacts but i guess theyre hard to get a specific calculation on them sandy h klugman  susquehanna financial group lllp research division okay great david w honeyfield and the one piece i will add is that if you look at net realized average net realized sales price weve continued to maintain a very significant advantage overall against our canadian our north american competitors and our estimate is that thats about  for the third quarter and that in light of all the items that kelvins touched on operator your next question comes from vincent andrews of morgan stanley vincent andrews  morgan stanley research division wondering if you can sort of provide a little more insight sort of on the dealer conversations i guess maybe in particular what im thinking about is just farmers as we get out of this year and looking to next year is there a sense and are dealers telling you that the farmers come in with orders for the spring in december that they would be willing to forward those orders to you or do you think dealers will go net short i mean what is their level of concern here kelvin g feist thanks for the question vincent its kelvin feist again i think what weve seen in last year maybe it is pretty fresher or a couple of years ago when we had some challenges i would say theres fewer dealers that are out there taking a speculative position they want to see the demand from the farm gate before they take a real strong position on inventories so i would say that there is a closer relationship there and so i think so long as the farmers are taking the dealers are very interested in taking and i would say that were going to get through a fall season and were expecting a decent application fall because we are ahead on our harvest right now so its relatively open and we think therell be a good plow down in the corn belt and et cetera vincent andrews  morgan stanley research division sure i guess maybe a part of what im also asking is sort of are the dealers telling you from their customer perspective that they dont think theyre going to get spring orders until the turn of the calendar year or do they think the typical tax sheltering activity is going to take place as we got out of the fall kelvin g feist yes i think most of the guys are focused on the fall today we have asked the questions about when the demand for spring and is it there we believe that it is we think that farmers have a reason and a tax reason to purchase so i think what were going to see is a drawdown of inventory a purchase of inventory as farmers come in and actually buy for anything they need for spring operator the next question comes from joel jackson of bmo capital markets joel jackson  bmo capital markets canada i wanted to check for the turnaround at east finished in september or with some carryover into october david w honeyfield no joel all of that was wrapped up in about the third week of september so the east plant is back and operating at normal levels at this time joel jackson  bmo capital markets canada so youre back at full capacity today david w honeyfield thats accurate yes joel joel jackson  bmo capital markets canada okay can you maybe review maybe what your turnaround schedules at your various plants for next year and maybe for  if you can david w honeyfield i can give you a very general sense of that it is one of the  its an item that were always looking at historically weve taken anywhere from a week to  weeks at each of our west facility and our east facility they tend to come in either the second or the third quarter our moab facility if you remember because of the fact that we are not harvesting during the summer thats when the evaporation season is ongoing maintenance just tends to take place over the summer its not necessarily a turnaroundtype situation and then wendover has that spread in smaller pieces throughout the year so a piece that i think is really important to understand is its not only turnaround on the maintenance pieces but as hugh highlighted we tied in  parts of the langbeinite recovery improvement project the debrine area then the fluidize bed dryer so those types of activities are occurring well see a few days of that as well here in the fourth quarter at east as we get the dmf circuit tied in and then the pelletization plant but its an item that were always looking at joel i cant give you a specific date and number of days because that will really be based on the needs and the schedule as we lay that out but thats  should be representative joel jackson  bmo capital markets canada okay what is a typical time to bring up a new mining panel to full capacity once its installed and what is the incremental capacity wed expect from a new mining panel in general david w honeyfield lets see the way were operating right now lets use west as an example and hugh certainly jump in here if i dont cover it fully west weve gone from  mining panels to  mining panels the time associated with that is getting some of the advanced electrical cabling conveyor system minor shuttle cars in service and from bringing the equipment down the shaft to getting it in service youre probably talking a couple of months hugh hugh e harvey yes typically  to day time period involved there both from the logistical standpoint as well as the construction time of the utilities and training of new crew and oftentimes we look at this both as capacity increase directly from that mine or online as well as being able to use it our hoisting capacity more efficiently because we have more panels to draw it from and greater reliability underground david w honeyfield right i think another piece to add that to joel is it gives us the capacity to increase some of our development tons which are really preparing areas for future mining and thats one of the things that were going to take advantage of with some increased underground capacity is trying to increase the ratio of some of our development work joel jackson  bmo capital markets canada okay and finally could you review what your current granular capacity is and what youll expect that to be at the end of  once wendover starts coming in david w honeyfield lets see im trying to remember the numbers that we reported on that i think we said were about  in terms of granulation capacity that will go up to about  or so with wendover coming online and then the piece that wed also ask you to focus on is our expectation is that all of the additional capacity coming on with the mining panel additions through   and  at west plus all of the capacity that will come on from hb well be able to be processed in the granular with the north compaction project that we announced last month operator your next question comes from mark gulley of ticonderoga securities mark r gulley  ticonderoga securities llc research division i want to go back to the marketing side for a second if i may given your  the geographic mix of markets you sell to is it possible youre a little bit more affected by the drought conditions and that maybe affecting demand pricing and those kinds of dynamics as compared to maybe producers that are a little bit more focus on the central corn belt kelvin g feist ill take the question mark in terms of our geographical mix i think we demonstrated that we are able to have a larger footprint and expand our geographies so i guess i dont believe that were impacted any different than other producers obviously theyre selling into all of north america and we can do that but were choosing to attempt to maximize our returns and stay closer to home and thats what  thats what our driver is but weve demonstrated that we can add geography if necessary mark r gulley  ticonderoga securities llc research division yes maybe i should have david w honeyfield mark this is dave the other mark r gulley  ticonderoga securities llc research division the truck market and then maybe youve benefited from strong local demand previously and that sort of not as good now with the drought conditions nearby kelvin g feist fair comment mark and i guess were going to have to deal with these kind of weather events from time to time and i think weve successfully dealt with them but there is an impact theres no doubt about it weve enjoyed that a decent truck market over the years specifically last year was very good for us and this year because of the drought we havent seen near the traffic that typically comes from that region david w honeyfield i think mark this is dave again this is really the part of the point of the fact that weve continued even in light of some of the shifting of some of our marketing efforts we continue to have that net realized sales price advantage so certainly theres potential to get there and it really gives us the geographical advantage we think relative to our competitors so i really think that the flexibility of adding granulation capacity at places like wendover and moab really allow us to have that region and frankly we see customers looking to make sure that they have multiple suppliers and thats just a piece of the market that exists today mark r gulley  ticonderoga securities llc research division okay secondly on the pricing side if i can both you and a large canadian supplier of potash today both commented that they sort of see flat pricing sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third given the strong crop economics prospects for good fall application all those kinds of positive tailwind i guess im a little surprised that youre as cautious as you are with respect to each of the shortterm pricing outlook and then maybe you can comment on whether or not that changes as we move into the spring kelvin g feist i guess its difficult for us to predict too far out on pricing obviously i made the comment that we havent realize the full benefit of our last price increase i think as we draw down inventories were going to get  were going to see that move closer to our reference price list and i think that will happen in the back end of this next quarter right now theres lots of inventory out there and i guess what were seeing is some of this trading going on thats putting some pressure on pricing mark r gulley  ticonderoga securities llc research division and then finally if i may and maybe we can do this better offline the hb solution mine appears to be your largest single project on a goforward basis maybe if you could just remind me some of the key parameters of the increase in capacity the onstream date those kinds of key highlight selling points for that particular project david w honeyfield mark this is dave im happy to touch on that now just as a reminder the project is going through the environmental impact assessment with the bureau of land management that process remains on track and the latest schedule provided to us by the blms contractor is that well receive the record of decision in the first quarter of  at that point in time we start construction of pond system the injection wells the extraction wells well start construction of the mill a little bit later in  and then we anticipate seeing first production at the end of  after the benefit of an evaporation season that will be a fairly moderate amount of production that comes online albeit meaningful and then we anticipate being at full production benefit which we estimate somewhere anywhere from  to  tons a year and our initial estimate are that well  we should be closer to the top end of that range and i think the important piece to keep in mind is that the cash operating cost associated with those tons are estimated somewhere in the  to  per ton range is the information weve been disclosing so the margin opportunity associated with those tons the increase in productive capacity by  to  those are the scale numbers that we have and it makes the capital investment very meaningful it has an excellent rate of return associated with it and like we said it covers off all the bases of the things that we know are important to us and continue to improve our competitive position operator operator instructions the next question comes from ben isaacson of scotia capital ben isaacson  scotia capital inc research division just a quick question on the evolution of your sales mix between industrial and agricultural potash can you just give me a reminder in terms of how that mix has changed over the last  years and where you think its going and what is the margin typically between the  segments david w honeyfield ben this is dave ill start on it and kelvin please feel free to add to it the mix that we have currently and well report in our q that will come out this afternoon is that  of our sales went into the agricultural area  went to industrial which is predominantly the oil and gas area and then  went into the feed markets the feed component remains a very important part of our business and pretty steady and predictable so that hasnt necessarily changed what we saw a couple of years ago in the    time period when you saw that significant increase in oil and gas pricing was an expansion of the amount of tonnage that we were selling into the oil and gas fields again keep in mind its for oil and gas drilling fluids and frac fluids when you saw the   at the end of   period a lot of the oil and gas guys closed down some of their capital program greatly reduced them so you saw that percentage shift pretty significantly to the single low teens so i think right now were  we feel comfortable with where the levels are the piece and maybe kelvin can talk a little bit more about this is the way were marketing today and the flexibility we have and we just go through the math on whether it makes more sense for us to sell a granular ton or a standard ton based on the demand and so weve gotten to the point where we have that flexibility and we can make the economic decision based on what the demand is because we can build whichever product we think gives us the best margin so kelvin anything to add to that kelvin g feist ben ill just add a couple of things here in terms of comparing the  markets youre asking the question about the industrial versus our ill call it our fertilizer market or ag market were really comparing a standard product versus the granular but ill just talk to our reference price were roughly  per short ton differential in reference price between the  products the standard being the lower price the one thing that you have to keep in mind with the industrial is that tends to be longer contracts in that business area or segment and so what were typically doing is looking at  or day contracts in the industrial side ben isaacson  scotia capital inc research division okay so i guess what i can take for that is even in an environment of flat pricing in q it certainly wouldnt be unreasonable to see a slight uptick in pricing just on the industrial side is that correct kelvin g feist well i think as i mentioned were moving towards a reference pricing so thats fair to say across the board operator the next question comes from farooq hamed of barclays capital farooq hamed  barclays capital research division i just want to spend a little more time on these new panels at east and west my understanding of the grades that you have in those mines is kind of somewhere in the range of  to  and im just wondering with these new panels are they going to be in that range and if so kind of where theyre going to be at towards the top or the bottom of that range i just want to get an idea to see how that might impact production and cost for next year david w honeyfield farooq this is dave i think the piece to keep in mind is that it gives us a lot of flexibility in our underground mining operations we certainly anticipate seeing an uptick in our tons mined and that will be in a variety of ore grades keep in mind we have the mixed ore body at east and there are elements of the mine that are higher in the trio or in the langbeinite grade than others so to say that its going to be x number of tons at x grade i think is a little bit of a challenge because we really run our mine plan as a system and we know what were trying to get out were always doing development work and like i mentioned earlier were going to likely see a little bit higher ratio of development tons i think you can do a really simple math on it and say that we should see approximately a  increase in the tons mined based on that math but you may see it at different grades because of the development activity so our goal as you know is to hold the line on our cost piece and then certainly well start to see the real benefit of that come through on hb so hopefully that gives you a little bit of color around it i just  its a question thats probably more of a detailed answer than one that has to do with our daytoday mine planning that well be at a level that i dont know that we can get into here on the call farooq hamed  barclays capital research division okay no thats fair that still helpful just one followup as well on hb your cash cost at  to  per ton can you remind me does that include the compaction cost david w honeyfield lets see  we i dont believe weve included compaction cost largely because weve included the price benefit of granular product and the compaction cost in our economics for the north mine the north compaction project pardon me farooq hamed  barclays capital research division right so  but for a kind of operating going forward what do you think on a per ton basis the compaction cost for the hb standard product will be or do you have a range david w honeyfield let me check here real quick were probably somewhere in that  for  per ton range farooq operator the next question comes from fai lee of oldum brown fai lee  rbc capital markets dave i just want to get your thoughts on the optimal longterm capital structure for the company after the major capital spend requirements are finished interest rates are pretty low and youve always had a pretty conservative balance sheet so im just wondering how you think about that maybe in the longer term david w honeyfield sure farooq  or sure fai i think we feel pretty good about the balance sheet we have right now and i think if you look at the returns on the investments we have having that cash and having the certainty that we can move forward with those capital projects we think is frankly a pretty envious position i can certainly appreciate the financial aspect of leverage and its one that ill let you know were not afraid to go down that path to some degree but having a very solid having a predictable balance sheet frankly allows us to weather situation like  we might have  we saw back in   the end of  to  and frankly for the foreseeable future i expect that that youll see a very strong balance sheet position for the company so  will be a year of significant capital investment and as we touched on earlier we should expect to see the cash and investment we have in our balance sheet put to use on the capital project and keep in mind i think there are a number of projects that come behind that so its just an ongoing assessment of whats the rate of return of the project relative to the capitalization of the company operator there are no further questions at this time ill turn the call back over to david honeyfield for any closing comments david w honeyfield we really just like to say thank you to everyone for
