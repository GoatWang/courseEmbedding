commentary for smartgridnewscom  thoughts on “publications  commentary” dear professor parker i am a singaporean entrepreneur developing a platform for my startup recently i read your book platform revolution in which you described our first prime minster mr lee kuan yew as an example of good governance as a singaporean i would like to thank you for this compliment at the same time i would like to point out that you had subsequently referred to him as yew which is not very correct for chinese names the convention is to have the last name in front followed by the first name hence mr lee’s last name is lee while his first name is kuan yew it would be more appropriate to either refer to him formally as lee or informally as kuan yew reply we thank you for your interest in the book your point about chinese names is well taken many thanks for pointing this out reply leave a reply cancel reply enter your comment here fill in your details below or click an icon to log in email required

sloan school date written september   abstract how can firms profitably give away free products this paper provides a novel answer and articulates tradeoffs in a space of information product design we introduce a formal model of twosided network externalities based in textbook economics  a mix of katz  shapiro network effects price discrimination and product differentiation externalitybased complements however exploit a different mechanism than either tying or lockin even as they help to explain many recent strategies such as those of firms selling operating systems internet browsers games music and videothe model presented here argues for three simple but useful results first even in the absence of competition a firm can rationally invest in a product it intends to give away into perpetuity second we identify distinct markets for content providers and end consumers and show that either can be a candidate for a free good third product coupling across markets can increase consumer welfare even as it increases firm profitsthe model also generates testable hypotheses on the size and direction of network effects while offering insights to regulators seeking to apply antitrust law to network markets keywords two sided markets network externalities network effects antitrust information pricing crosssubsidy freemium jel classification d d l l l m suggested citation
