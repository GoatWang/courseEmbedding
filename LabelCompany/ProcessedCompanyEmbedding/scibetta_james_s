                                                                           pacira pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq pcrx is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical and commercial development of new products that meet the needs of acute care practitioners and their patients the companys flagship product exparel® bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension indicated for singledose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia was commercially launched in the united states in april  exparel and two other products have successfully utilized depofoam® a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure and releases them over a desired period of time additional information about pacira is available at wwwpaciracom about exparel® exparel bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension is currently indicated for singledose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia the product combines bupivacaine with depofoam® a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period exparel represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri or postsurgical setting by utilizing the depofoam platform a single dose of exparel delivers bupivacaine over time providing significant reductions in cumulative pain score with up to a  percent decrease in opioid consumption the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated additional information is available at wwwexparelcom   important safety information exparel is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia exparel has not been studied for use in patients younger than  years of age nonbupivacainebased local anesthetics including lidocaine may cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from exparel if administered together locally the administration of exparel may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of  minutes or more other formulations of bupivacaine should not be administered within  hours following administration of exparel monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological status as well as vital signs should be performed during and after injection of exparel as with other local anesthetic products because amidetype local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized by the liver exparel should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease patients with severe hepatic disease because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations in clinical trials the most common adverse reactions incidence greaterthan or equal to  following exparel administration were nausea constipation and vomiting please see the full prescribing information for more details available at httpwwwexparelcompdfexparelprescribinginformationpdf  forward looking
