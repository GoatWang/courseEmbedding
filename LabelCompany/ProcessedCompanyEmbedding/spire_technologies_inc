suitable living accommodations using their preferred criteria in whichever city around the world they are pursuing their studies  this will simplify the students search significantly while also giving landlords an easy and convenient way to rent out their properties with minimal effort  with over  years of experience in running their own student housing they successfully beta tested the concept on their own student housing facilities and are now ready to roll out the platform to the b north american student housing market according to concordia small business consulting bureau which completed the companys research and business plan  amyn murji commented on the business dynamics we have found that with the number of young people around the world pursuing higher education as well as the amount of students travelling outside of their own cities and often their own countries in order to pursue their studies there is a massive amount of demand for student housing in cities across the world  international students spending in all  states contributed more than  billion to the us economy in   according to the national center for education statistics in  approximately  million students were expected to attend american colleges and universities however what we have found is that there is often little to no guidance for these students to find a place to live when arriving in their city of choice  with dormbooker students eliminate the need to search several different websites in order to compare their options and it also allows students to highlight the criteria that is most important to them whether it be proximity budget or certain facility requirements or preferences  on the flip side of the coin many landlords face challenges in ensuring their properties get the right type of exposure as well as challenges relating to all of the back and forth that is often required in order to rent out a unit to a student often in another time zone  dormbooker will simplify the process for everyone involved   murji and zigman are confident that the dormbooker platform is a robust and integrated platform fully engineered to meet all expectations of both landlords and students zigman added with a low cost structure and our solid experience in the industry dormbooker has the potential to become a dominant player in an already attractive student housing market and the capability to seize the opportunities of other markets with our diversified backgrounds and experience we are confident that we can quickly become every students first stop when looking for accommodations  we truly believe that our focus on simplifying every part of the process for all parties and fusing this with being part of the hyper successful online booking industry will be the
