revolutionizing cancer treatment with immunotherapy power of immunotherapy immunosuppression and cancer immunity  cancer power of immunotherapy an increasingly important strategy against cancer the idea that tumors could be recognized and rejected by the immune system was initially proposed in the late th century upon the observation that rare spontaneous tumor regressions occurred following infections which may result in general activation of the immune system more recently preclinical studies revealed that tumors express immunogenic antigens and that these antigens induce immune responses that are able to protect against subsequent tumor challenges patients with melanoma were demonstrated to have t cells with specific activity against melanoma cells and these cells were shown to be able to cause cancer regression when stimulated outside the body and returned to the patient over the last few years it has been recognized that the immune system in many patients has the ability to respond to cancer but is usually prevented from doing so by immune defenses present in cancer cells many researchers and companies are studying a variety of means to overcome these defenses and activate the immune system more powerfully against cancer cells proof of concept for cancer immunotherapeutics has been established with recent drug approvals for various immune checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic melanoma and certain forms of lung cancer cancer defenses limit the effectiveness of the natural immune response the current model of cancer immunology is that tumor cells are antigenic capable of being recognized by the immune system but are insufficiently immunogenic due to multiple tumorinduced mechanisms of immune suppression that prevent the development of meaningful immune responses cancer immunotherapy is based on restoring the ability of the immune system to be activated and attack the tumor immunosuppression is known to be present in patients with scchn who are consistently found to have disordered immune function at the time of presentation although they have normal bcell function immunoglobulin levels and complement systems scchn patients have immunological deficiencies of tcell anergy and defective monocytemacrophage function the cumulative result of the various immune defects and immunosuppressive mechanisms in scchn is the tumor successfully subverts the antigen presentation component ie dendritic cells and the responding tcell component of immunization even though the tumor displays and sheds antigens capable of inducing immunization and tumor rejection the compromised cellular immune response is therefore incapable of inducing tumor rejection scchn squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck references nauts hc

therapeutics  unlocking the power of immunotherapy contact us news  events search for unlocking the power of immunotherapy irx therapeutics is a clinicalstage bioresearch company developing irx an important new immunotherapy candidate for cancer irx therapeutics is a clinicalstage company developing novel immunotherapies focused on reducing the immune suppression that is seen in the cancer tumor microenvironment restoring immune function and activating a coordinated immune response against the tumor the lead candidate irx is a proprietary therapeutic containing numerous active cytokine components data collected to date indicates that irx acts to restore and activate a coordinated immune response against the tumor irx is a proprietary therapeutic containing numerous active cytokine components which restores and activates multiple immune cell types including t cells dendritic cells and natural killer cells to recognize and destroy tumors currently irx is being studied in an

standard of care is curative surgery followed by adjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence fiveyear survival rates are approximately  and successfully treated patients may still have to cope with consequences of their treatment that affect appearance function and quality of life despite improvements in therapy recurrent disease remains frequent and is generally treated with radiation therapy chemotherapy biological therapy or a combination of these modalities the prognosis in recurrent or metastatic disease is poor with median survival less than  year clearly better therapies in the firstline setting are needed potential role of irx reduce postsurgical recurrence in scchn irx is in clinical investigation to determine whether neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with irx in newly diagnosed scchn beginning before curative surgery can reduce the risk of recurrence irx believes that by shifting the balance back to immunosurveillance by overcoming cancerinduced immune
