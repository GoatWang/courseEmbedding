excruciatingly long i was referred to dr francis from my gp it was determined within my first visit that i would need a laminectomy for a pinched sciatic nerve dr francis agreed with how the nerve was pinched that i was in much discomfort and we moved forward with the plan for surgery dr francis promised a two week interval between surgery and returning to work the actual recovery time for a laminectomy is a minimult  may  it was good jeremy haferkamp in gatesville tx  apr  horrible experience never saw him after surgery in the hospital left in worse pain than i went in had to go back due to a screw he put in causing a secondary fracture in vertebrae pushing bone splinter into nerve bundle at spine couldnt get the right help over the phone still in horrible pain lost my job it has been over a year and i have permanent damage due to his  surgeries i a disabled because of him please do not chance using himhouston tx  feb  dr francis was very helpful in treating my husband after he was injured at work i took him to his appointment and we both had a very positive experience he was thorough and very friendly i was expecting a long wait time after reading some of the other reviews but that was not my experience he has a follow up scheduled after his first injection and we will see where we go from therehouston tx  feb  this was my very first visit ever with a specialist regarding my lower back pain i will not be going back to this doctor i waited  hours to see him that is when i got an office manager involved expressing my visit nurses were rude i was forced to have xray when all of my imaging is up to date he came in treated me like a number i felt no type of concern from him he forced expensive pt on me through his company i will be taking my business elsewhere beaware wait time rude staff houston tx  jan  ridiculous wait times the second visit we waited  hours and then left without seeing the doctor when you finally see the doctor its for  minutes they make you pay a ton of money before claims are processed others say its worth the wait to see him but when you have a patient with unbearable backleg pain and make them wait hours to be seen its not worth it in my opinion he will not see you or do surgery unless you pay upfront bradely in vidor tx  dec  dr francis did my  year old sons back surgery in oct he did a great job he was always willing to answer any question i or my son had never rushed us with this whole thing his after care has been just as great we went for a check up and seen the nurse but ran into him in the hall he stopped and talked to my son about how he was doing and when they thought he could go back to normal activity he is also doing his therapy with him and has been doing great my son is no longer in pain from thisjoshua d in beaumont tx  nov  two words would really sum up my review so unethical after performing the surgery he refused to see me anymore even though i was still having pain issues after surgery he only cares about surgeries and making money off you by not seeing me he can advertise that only  of his patients are recurring ive seen doctors for my back issues for  years dr francis is a quack and a scam he told me he was fusing one disk but the day of my surgery after they already had me hooked up to an ijeana f in beaumont tx  sep  first i was treated like a drug addict being told to leave my purse in the exam room because it wasnt allowed in the restroom with me to finally after waiting  hrs finally the dr came in only to be told by the dr himself not to talk his nurse would tell him all of my problems and if the  back surgeries hadnt worked a th sure wasnt going to help  you know i wonder if he realized he just called himself a poor surgeon he was so arrogant and beyond rudeimran in houston tx  sep  i want to give zero star to this doctor he is kind of doctor who would look at you as youre a bank check and not a patient total waste of time and money he conducted completely irrelevant tests from out of network lab i am sure some way associated with him and declared need of urgent surgery giving a completely wrong medical explanation i told him i would like to get another opinion but his staff called me very next morning to schedule surgery just after money isabel leal in texas  aug  absolutely horrible no bedside mannerrude and arroganthad a  pm appointment and it was  pm when i was seen and he gave us  min of his time can never get the same person at his officenobody knows what is going onis a complete cluster mess he maybe a great surgeon but i wont find out after that first introduction brett o in beaumont tx  aug  i would absolutely recommend dr francis and would have the surgery done again in a heartbeat i went from not being able to do hardly anything for about  years and being terrified of the horrors of surgery to being able to do anything i wanted after surgery and about two months of physical therapy thank you and your staff the wait time at appointments is somewhat lengthy but you have one dr seeing everyone from the golden triangle that wanted to see him very informative on procedures mike c in spring tx  jul  i highly recommend that you see another doctor his bedside manner lacked hes egotistical and i did not feel comfortable around him after my surgery prior to surgery the anesthesiologist as well as dr francis were rushed and impersonal he didnt know what he prescribed me after surgery he didnt know if he had recommended a chiropractor or pt he sent in his pa to see me each time and there was a sense that he was disinterested wait time was three hours to be seen mar  horrible i wouldnt even give one star we arrived a little before  for our  oclock appointment and we left a little after  because we still had not been seen by dr francis we were told that we still had  patients ahead of us waiting over  hours to see a doctor is ridiculous periodtk in friendswood tx  feb  dont waste your time im almost positive md owns part of or gets payment due to ownership of the drug testing labs you should see all that they billed my insurance for for  visit  different cpt codes and now sending me a bill i waited over  hours and staff says wait is usually over  hours horrible horrible bed side manner spoke like a robot and would only talk through his nppa which was so awkward i felt so sorry for her there are way too many drs to waste your timeearlan mccray  jan  i earlan mccray would like to take this opportunity to say thank you thank you for a spine surgery well done and to you and your staff for the professional and knowledgeable people that you all are and for answering all of my questions in a way that i could relate to and making me feel very comfort at office and at the hospital i would recommend family and friends to you and your staff once again thank you thank you drr francis and staffhouston  dec  i was just told i was a candidate for surgery by a different doctor i was terrified  wanted a second opinion dr francis has a wonderful bedside manner and friendly staff my scoliosis has progressed significantly  even though the other doctor suggested surgery dr francis assured me that we needed to take a conservative approach first i started physical therapy  will go back in a year to remeasure i am confident in dr francis  will be recommending anyone with back pain

conditions an accurate diagnosis can only be reached through a thorough examination by a specialist with experience and extensive training in spine and is the only one that is going to be able to sort through the noise and find the root cause of the patients pain every patient receives a comprehensive exam which includes a review of the patients medical history thorough physical examination diagnostic testing if needed to confirm diagnosis and a detailed explanation of their condition and treatment options the most important thing in our whole approach is to obtain an accurate diagnosis i increase the likelihood of that by taking responsibility for each of the above processes by seeing each and every patient myself at every appointment if surgery is needed it is actually the least challenging part×dr francis saysbeing the first surgeon in houston to employ the mazor robotics renaissance guidance system in  indicates his innovative and cutting edge use of the latest technology with proven results the surgical team at spine associates was among a few in the united states equipped with this advanced technology spine surgeons realized the enormous benefits the technology had to offer to the surgeon and their patients and its starting to become the standard of care throughout the country we continue to differentiate ourselves purely on the basis of doing spinal surgery i
