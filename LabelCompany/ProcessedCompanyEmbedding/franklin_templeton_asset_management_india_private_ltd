fund for first timers mutual funds may sound complex but in reality mutual funds are anything but intimidating mutual funds are in fact for the benefit of those who want to take the advantage of investing across equity debt gold etc but may not have the skill set time or financial wherewithal to do so this is exactly where a mutual fund comes in as it is a professionally managed collective investment vehicle that lets you invest in small amounts and reap big benefits so long as you choose the right schemes in line with the goals you have set for yourself mutual funds also provide you multiple advantages of flexibility liquidity tax benefits and diversification of risk at a very small price in this video we decode mutual funds for you know more difference between savings vs investing difference between savings vs investing a hard working individual who is earning a decent income in today’s date is judicious about his expenses and even manages to put away  of his income he may be content with himself because he is saving money but he will be none the richer by his retirement age if he lets this money lie idle without earning any returns to meet specific goals like children’s education marriage or ensuring a comfortable retirement one needs to put this money saved to good use over a period of time in a patient and disciplined manner the process of doing so is called investing through several examples we take a closer look at the fundamental difference between saving and investing and why you must focus on investing rather than let your money sit idle benefits of mutual funds benefits of mutual funds mutual funds are often misunderstood as a complex investment vehicle in reality however they are pretty simple in their investment philosophy and offer the investor a host of benefits such as diversification professional money management economies of scale transparency liquidity to mention a few in this video we take you through the different benefits a mutual fund investor can avail of to grow his corpus and meet his financial goals by choosing the right kind of funds for the time horizon he has set to meet his financial goals understanding asset classes understanding asset classes in order to invest your savings so that it earns the highest possible returns at the lowest possible risk you need to choose various investment avenues each having unique characteristics of risk and returns these are known as asset classes and examples include  cash bonds equities real estate gold and other commodities mutual funds offer you the benefit of investing in various asset classes and diversifying to reduce the risk of your investments in this video we take you through all that you need to know about asset classes and tell you how you need a combination of these asset classes to meet you financial goals consequences of delay in investing consequences of delay in investing most young people tend to think that they have “enough time to invest in the future” and delay their investment process but what they do not realise is that by “waiting for the right time” or out of sheer lethargy they are missing out on the power of compounding in this video we explain why beginning your investment process early and staying invested over a long period of time will be more beneficial than investing a larger sum at a later date thus investing smaller sums of money systematically regularly and patiently over a period of time will help you reach your financial goals slowly but steadily take a closer look to understand why a delay in investing may cost you dearly what is mutual fund what is mutual fund for first timers mutual funds may sound complex but in reality mutual funds are anything but intimidating mutual funds
