portfolio pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs these costs which are not reflected in annual portfolio operating expenses or in the example affect the portfolio s performance during the most recent fiscal year the portfolio turnover rate for the portfolio was  of the average value of its portfolio  principal investment strategies the portfolio s subadviser barrow hanley mewhinney  strauss llc the subadviser  deploys an active strategy that seeks large and middle capitalization uslisted stocks including american depositary receipts  adrs  which make up a portfolio that generally exhibits the following value characteristics priceearnings and pricebook ratios at or below the market sp  index and dividend yields at or above the market in addition the subadviser considers stocks for the portfolio that not only currently pay a dividend but also have a consecutive year history of paying cash dividends the subadviser also seeks stocks that have long established histories of dividend increases in an effort to ensure that the growth of the dividend stream of the portfolio s holdings will be greater than that of the market as a whole the subadviser utilizes a conservative orientation based on the belief that aboveaverage returns can be achieved while taking belowaverage risks the subadviser s investment approach is based on an underlying philosophy that securities markets are inefficient and that these inefficiencies can be favorably exploited through adherence to a valueoriented investment process dedicated to individual stock selection on a bottomup basis accordingly the subadviser constructs a portfolio of individual stocks selected on a bottomup basis using fundamental analysis the subadviser seeks to identify companies that are undervalued and temporarily outoffavor for reasons it can identify and understand the subadviser does not attempt to time the market or rotate in and out of broad market sectors as it believes that it is difficult if not impossible to add incremental value on a consistent basis by market timing the portfolio will generally consist of  to  stocks with position sizes of  to   maximum position weighting annual portfolio turnover is anticipated to be less than  if a stock held in the portfolio omits its dividend the portfolio is not required to immediately sell the stock but the portfolio will not purchase any stock that does not have a year record of paying cash dividends the subadviser employs a fully invested strategy therefore under normal market conditions cash and cash equivalents are generally less than  of the portfolio s assets under adverse or unstable market economic or political conditions the portfolio may take temporary defensive positions in cash and shortterm debt securities without limit during periods of defensive investing it will be more difficult for the portfolio to achieve its objective principal risks risk is inherent in all investing many factors affect the portfolio s performance there is no assurance the portfolio will meet its investment objective the value of your investment in the portfolio as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly you may lose part or all of your investment in the portfolio or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments the following is a summary description of principal risks in alphabetical order of investing in the portfolio you may lose money if you invest in this portfolio cash management and defensive investing the value of investments held by the portfolio for cash management or defensive investing purposes can fluctuate like other fixed income securities cash and cash equivalent securities are subject to risk including market interest rate and credit risk if the portfolio holds cash uninvested the portfolio will be subject to the credit risk of the depository institution holding the cash it will not earn income on the cash and the portfolio s yield will go down to the extent that the portfolio s assets are used for cash management or defensive investing purposes it may not achieve its objective depositary receipts depositary receipts may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market any distributions paid to the holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights and investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert equity shares into depositary receipts and vice versa such restrictions may cause equity shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipts equity securities equity securities represent an ownership interest in an issuer rank junior in a company s capital structure and consequently may entail greater risk of loss than debt securities equity securities include common and preferred stocks stock markets are volatile the price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions if the market prices of the equity securities owned by the portfolio fall the value of your investment in the portfolio will decline expenses your actual costs of investing in the portfolio may be higher than the expenses shown in this prospectus for a variety of reasons for example expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease net assets are more likely to decrease and portfolio expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile  focused investing to the extent the portfolio invests in one or more countries regions sectors or industries or in a limited number of issuers the portfolio will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those countries regions sectors industries or issuers local events such as political upheaval financial troubles or natural disasters may disrupt a country s or region s securities markets geographic risk is especially high in emerging markets foreign investments investing in securities of foreign issuers or issuers with significant exposure to foreign markets involves additional risk foreign countries may have markets that are less liquid less regulated and more volatile than us markets the value of the portfolio s investments may decline because of factors affecting the particular issuer as well as foreign markets and issuers generally such as unfavorable government actions political or financial instability or other adverse economic or political developments lack of information and weaker accounting standards also may affect the value of these securities liquidity some securities held by the portfolio may be difficult to sell or illiquid particularly during times of market turmoil illiquid securities may also be difficult to value if the portfolio is forced to sell an illiquid asset to meet redemption requests or other cash needs the portfolio may be forced to sell at a loss manager the subadviser to the portfolio actively manages the portfolio s investments consequently the portfolio is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the subadviser may not produce the desired results this could cause the portfolio to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives market the market prices of the portfolio s securities may go down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to general market conditions such as real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions inflation changes in interest rates or currency rates lack of liquidity in the markets or adverse investor sentiment adverse market conditions may be prolonged and may not have the same impact on all types of securities market prices of securities also may go down due to events or conditions that affect particular sectors industries or issuers when market prices fall the value of your investment will go down the portfolio may experience a substantial or complete loss on any individual security the financial crisis that began in  has caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities of issuers worldwide some governmental and nongovernmental issuers notably in europe have defaulted on or been forced to restructure their debts and many other issuers have faced difficulties obtaining credit these market conditions may continue worsen or spread including in the us europe and beyond in response to the financial crisis the us and other governments and the federal reserve and certain foreign central banks have taken steps to support financial markets the withdrawal of this support failure of efforts in response to the crisis or investor perception that these efforts are not succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally as well as the value and liquidity of certain securities high public debt in the us and other countries creates ongoing systemic and market risks and policymaking uncertainty in addition policy and legislative changes in the us and in other countries are affecting many aspects of financial regulation the impact of these changes and the practical implications for market participants may not be fully known for some time mediumcapitalization companies the portfolio will be exposed to additional risks as a result of its investments in the securities of medium capitalization companies investing in medium capitalization companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with more established companies the prices of securities of medium capitalization companies generally are more volatile and are more likely to be adversely affected by changes in earnings results and investor expectations or poor economic or market conditions securities of medium capitalization companies may underperform larger capitalization companies may be harder to sell at times and at prices the portfolio managers believe appropriate and may offer greater potential for losses portfolio selection the value of your investment may decrease if the subadviser s judgment about the quality relative yield value or market trends affecting a particular security or issuer industry sector region or market segment or about the economy or interest rates is incorrect valuation the sales price the portfolio could receive for any particular portfolio investment may differ from the portfolio s valuation of the investment particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology value investing the prices of securities the subadviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as anticipated or may go down value stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the overall equity market for a long period of time for example while the market favors growth stocks performance the bar chart and the table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the portfolio the bar chart shows how the portfolio s performance has varied from year to year the table shows how the portfolio s average annual total returns for different periods compare to the returns of a broad measure of market performance the performance calculations do not reflect any charges that are or may be imposed under your variable life insurance policy or variable annuity  contract if such charges were reflected performance would be lower absent any limitation of the portfolio s expenses total returns would be lower in the  years or since inception column of the table returns are shown for ten years or since inception of the class whichever is less index
