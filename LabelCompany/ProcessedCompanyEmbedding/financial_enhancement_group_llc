pm by joseph clark cfp categories newspaper column as the world’s most tracked stock index the sp  was never intended to be an investment guidance tool  rather the index was developed to serve as an indicator economists could use when comparing various sectors of the us economy the index’s creators based the design on the theory that the economy vacillates between market peaks and bottoms expanding and contracting in a cyclical manner standard and poor’s was commissioned to identify us companies representing various sectors which would presumably perform differently based on the economic movement for example utilities and consumer goods companies are expected to perform well when the economy contracts into a recession likewise industrial companies should do better when the economy is expanding while most financial professionals discount the index as a reliable economic indicator it continues to serve as a central measure of investment performance nonetheless today’s sp index is composed of nine sectors and the difference in dividend yields between one sector and another can be substantial let’s say you are a passive investor and simply own an exchange traded fund etf that attempts to replicate the performance of the sp in both a qualified and nonqualified account you have an equal amount of money in your ira and in your taxable account each owning the fund becoming proactive from a tax investment perspective can put money in your billfold currently the dividend yield in xly the exchange traded fund representing the consumer discretionary stocks within the sp  is  though each sector has a positive yield xly’s yield is currently the lowest the highest yielding sector is xlv the etf for the health care sector at   a  difference over xly if you put the higher dividend yielding sectors in your ira and the lower yielding sectors in your taxable account the investment profile remains the same creating simultaneous tax efficiency the higher your marginal bracket the better this gets  being a proactive investor means paying attention to the taxes as well as fees and expenses not just the investments themselves consider this radio show posted

pm by joseph clark cfp categories newspaper column waking up early and heading to the gym is tough but once the workout is over the payoff is often a tremendous energy boost while people exercise for many reasons they usually expect to benefit from their “sweat equity” not in the current moment but in the future   we will all encounter health issues at some time and the medical world assures us we will be better equipped to deal with health problems if we get – and stay – physically fit preparation matters   perhaps you’re asking what exercise has in common with financial planning and investing good question the answer is very few individuals prepare to invest most folks look at the choices in their retirement plan and make selections studies have shown that more than  of k plan participants made no changes in   perhaps the most volatile market year in history     getting back to the fitness analogy the greatest benefits of exercise come from the stress we intentionally place on our muscles so that when a health problem arises our bodies are in better condition to deal with the situation from an investment perspective investors who choose to go it alone need a methodical regimen for taking in and processing market data they also need to develop a strategy to accommodate unforeseen yet inevitable future events   when it comes to market data investors should not allow random news clips to guide their decisions and they must filter out market “noise” in determining how to act on the data for the record you dont have to make changes in your portfolio just because something changed but you must be prepared to consider adjustments when the information dictates conditions have shifted   the financial industry refers to this as an investment policy statement i prefer to use the term investment playbook  the playbook specifies how we intend to respond to change with a disciplined approach aimed at particular objectives it’s a much better approach than reacting to wall street and the media’s noise  great stock or even mutual fund opportunities may arise but if they dont match the investor’s playbook they need to stay on the bench   the playbook should describe what the investor is trying to achieve and how market changes will be managed a welldesigned playbook keeps investors from making emotional decisions or “freezing up” during confusing times like those the market experienced in  the playbook should clearly document investment information sources the technology involved in investing and why a particular investment was purchased   i have been married for  years and people continue to ask me how i met my bride barb the initial decision matters in marriage and it should matter in investing as well  why was an investment purchased and when will it be sold off  unlike marriage stocks are rarely lifetime decisions   when you go to the gym you can wander aimlessly or plan to invest your energy  i think you know which one works best investing is no different   consider this radio show posted on february    am by admin categories consider this radio show here is this week’s radio show hosted by joe clark cfp with sherri contos

strategy for tax savings posted on january    am by joseph clark cfp categories newspaper column the current tax code allows us taxpayers to make financial gifts of up to  to any other us citizen for  these gifts are taxfree to the donor and the recipient provided the gifts are of “present interest” meaning no strings attached beneficiaries must be able to use the gift without any restrictions many of us have children that are in lower tax brackets than ourselves yet who still have earned income even a child working part time may have earned more than  of earned income in  provided the child has not contributed to another ira and does indeed have  or more of income  if they are over  years of age they can make  ira contributions up until april   alas one common problem often arises  they have no money left this is a frequent issue for younger folks and low income earners consequently building taxfree wealth in a roth ira becomes out of the question given their financial means that is where gifts of  or less come into play the money contributed to a roth ira doesn’t have to come from the account owner’s paycheck  he or she simply must have paid taxes on  or more of earned income in the taxable year keep in mind that income could have also been earned by a spouse as long as their joint income is less than  filing jointly or  filling as individuals they are eligible to contribute better yet let’s say you were fortunate enough to buy a stock or exchange traded fund etf more than a year ago and it has substantially increased in value let’s also assume at some point in your life you need or want to subsidize a wedding or some other life event for a child or grandchild the roth gifting strategy maybe a perfect fit for you roth accounts offer liquidity as contributions can always be withdrawn on demand and the money has already been taxed  just realize that growth on ira contributions must remain in the account for at least five years or until age  depending on the tax code at the time and the need for the money  but the contribution is always available so if grandpa joe gives his granddaughter  which is less than  no taxes are due if the granddaughter places the money in a roth ira it will count as a contribution and she may retrieve the money anytime she needs or wants it grandpa joe could also decide to gift his grandchild  worth of appreciated stock instead of using cash if the grandchild’s marginal tax bracket is  or less then she would pay zero capital gains tax on the sale of the stock in her name in this perfect world example we have paid zero taxes on capital gains allowed for a grandchild to start a taxfree retirement plan and helped prefund an anticipated future expense consider this radio show posted on january    am by admin

trip consider currency changes posted on january    pm by joseph clark cfp categories newspaper column calculating currency valuations from one country to another is complex and most people don’t give the subject much thought until it is time to travel they may visit their bank for a few euros’ but will usually use a credit card to cover their tab on the spanish rivera or at the tuscan villa consequently they count fluctuating currency rates as part of the vacation cost but for corporations fluctuating currency rates are much more impactful switzerland surprised the world by reaffirming its commitment to keep the franc at  to the euro on january  then suddenly changed its position on january   sending the euro falling and the franc soaring so what german businesses suddenly found it much more expensive to buy swiss watches or chocolates or cheese and switzerland’s exporters were caught in a battle literally overnight  meanwhile swiss citizens enjoyed welcome wealth unlike an american who may plan an occasional trip to paris it is quite common for a swiss citizen to drive to france for a day thus the currency move noted above suddenly put an extra  of buying power into the hands of swiss citizens visiting france would it surprise you that they bought all the fresh meat in sight they did we live in a global society and understanding currency fluctuation is much more than calculating travel costs exporters win or lose every time currency valuations change keep in mind the euro has declined from  to the us dollar in  to  in january  the new mercedes is more affordable here but apple iphones are much more expensive in germany don’t feel too flush with the dollar’s value remember nearly half the earnings in the sp  come from companies based outside the us unlike consumers who consider currency fluctuation part of an occasional trip the business of companies like ge and caterpillar are significantly affected by currency fluctuations daily like all financial decisions including investments and retirement planning the further out you plan your trip the more successful your journey will be remember to add currency to your budgeting discussion consider this

earnings posted on january    pm by joseph clark cfp categories newspaper column business ceos and their boards must make many decisions where do they invest in their business do they add new business models buy competitors or dive deeper into their niche what do they do with leftover profits     amid all of these questions a key consideration to keep in mind is that the decisions business leaders make don’t take place in a vacuum but are influenced – and sometimes even dictated by external conditions in today’s context the conditions we are discussing include very low interest rates and changing tax policy   a company’s board has basically three decisions with regards to how to use the company’s profits they can reinvest in the business today or at a later time issue dividends to shareholders or buy back shares   the us equity market has experienced significant price appreciation in recent years in large part that growth has been driven by several sources and reflects multiple sectors across the economy   in the aftermath of the economic collapse of  business leaders were forced to focus tightly on the bottom line by embracing technology concentrating on profitability and making some very difficult and often unpopular decisions business leaders continued to defend the bottom line consequently as profits have increased annually top line revenue has flat lined this is not an ideal situation   the very low interest rate environment has allowed leaders to borrow money in the bond market with yields that are near the dividend yield their stocks are paying  keep in mind a coupon payment on a bond doesnt fluctuate over the life of the bond and that the payments are fully deductible from a tax standpoint in contrast a stock’s dividend yield is calculated based on the current share price of the stock if a stock trades at  per share and pays a  dividend the yield is  if the same stock rises to  per share the dividend yield falls to   continually in flux as stock prices change   dividends are taxable to both to the corporation and to the shareholder  the tax changes in  made dividends even more taxable for individuals earning higher incomes the combination of lower rates and tax policy has led to market appreciation in the form of reducing the shares if a company makes  but reduces the number of shares outstanding then the earnings per share increase even though the business didnt necessarily grow   our economy has certainly come a long way from  in comparison to our european counterparts we are still experiencing minor inflation while the eurozone has fallen into deflation that is very concerning for all of us while experts expect interest rates to rise this year they errantly made the same prediction last year as a result the opportunity to borrow at low rates and buy back shares is diminishing   just as ceos must decide where to invest profits you must decide where to invest your nest egg  proceed with caution   « previous     next »
