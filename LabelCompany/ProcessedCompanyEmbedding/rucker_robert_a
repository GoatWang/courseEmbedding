louisiana  after graduating from franklin high school in  he enlisted int the us navy where he served until   immediately following his military days don joined an exploratory seismographic company that allowed him to experience the glaciers of alaska and canada the beaches of bahamas and most of the terrain between them     during his time with the seismographic company dons interest in art began to grow   so at the age of  don began attending classes at southeastern louisiana university the next four years were spent mostly on conservative studies of art that provided don with a firm foundation in drawing and composition  after he completed his ba he was accepted to an mfa program at the pratt institute of new york  don finished the pratt institute in  with an emphasis in painting drawing and what he would later call his favorite medium sculpture       while most established louisiana artists are known for their interpretations of backwater bayous or the vieux carre  don seems never to have settled on a particular theme  his style of painting is always unmistakable but it can be found in subjects ranging from swamps to nudes and courtyards to cabins  in his own words don said of his art  my intent is to fuse internal reality within the artist with outside stimuli the product being the finished art object  i deliberately subordinate all questions of style technique subject and medium to this simple credo     dons work has been featured in gilleys gallery and also in the collections of lsu  the ziegler museum louisiana s permanent collection and many private collectors throughout the south     don wright quietly passed away in january of   he will truly be missed                     karenrobertruckerartcom                  wwwrobertruckerartcom
