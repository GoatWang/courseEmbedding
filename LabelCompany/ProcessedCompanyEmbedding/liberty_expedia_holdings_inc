registration statement having gone effective the company is required to file a form q for the quarter ended september   the expedia holdings splitoff is currently expected to occur at  pm new york city time on november   subject to the satisfaction or waiver as applicable of certain conditions overview we own an approximate  equity interest and  voting interest in expedia as of september   historically liberty interactive has been a party to a stockholders agreement with mr barry diller chairman of the board and senior executive officer of expedia pursuant to which mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy the diller proxy over all the shares of expedia common stock expe and expedia class b common stock owned by liberty interactive liberty interactive is also subject to a governance agreement with expedia which provides for the right to nominate approximately  of the members of expedias board of directors which is currently comprised of  members three of which were nominated by liberty interactive the governance agreement also provides for registration and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on the ownership of shares of expedia class b common stock pursuant to the governance agreement liberty interactive has and following the completion of the expedia holdings splitoff the company will have preemptive rights that entitle it to purchase a number of shares of expedia common stock excluding certain issuances related to options warrants or convertible securities so that liberty interactive or the company as applicable will maintain the identical ownership interest in expedia subject to certain adjustments that it had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance but not in excess of  any purchase by liberty interactive or the company as applicable will be allocated between expe and expedia class b common stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right except to the extent that liberty interactive or the company as applicable opts to acquire shares of expe in lieu of shares of expedia class b common stock based on the stockholders agreement and the governance agreement the company determined that prior to the expedia holdings splitoff it does not control expedia but instead has significant influence with respect to expedia and accordingly accounts for its investment in expedia as an equity method affiliate in connection with the expedia holdings splitoff a the governance agreement and stockholders agreement will be assigned by liberty interactive to the company and b diller will cease to directly control a majority voting interest in expedia by irrevocably assigning the diller proxy to the company for a period of time up to  months following completion of the expedia holdings splitoff subject to certain termination events by virtue of i certain governance rights with respect to the company as set forth in the companys restated charter an amendment to the stockholders i table of contents agreement and an amended and restated transaction group among mr diller john c malone malone leslie malone mrs malone and together with malone the malone group liberty interactive and the company and ii the grant by the malone group of an irrevocable proxy to vote subject to certain exceptions shares of the companys common stock beneficially owned by the malone group upon the completion of the expedia holdings splitoff or thereafter for a period of time ending upon termination of dillers assignment of the diller proxy the arrangements described in clauses i and ii the proxy arrangements diller will be able to elect and replace the directors of the company who will determine how the company will exercise certain rights and vote the shares of expe and expedia class b common stock owned by the company in the election of expedia directors though malone will retain the ability to remove such directors of the company the rights under the governance agreement and stockholders agreement each as assigned and amended will be maintained even upon termination of the proxy arrangements as a result expedia holdings expects to begin consolidating expedia as of the completion of the expedia holdings splitoff as expedia holdings will then control a majority of the voting interest in expedia in conjunction with application of acquisition accounting we
