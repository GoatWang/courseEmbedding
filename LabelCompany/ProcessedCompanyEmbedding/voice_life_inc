period we require a minimum of  of funding from this offering we anticipate that after the initial twelve month period we many need additional funding in the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority  for general administrative expenses including legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the sec  for office lease expenses and office equipment  for sales and marketing and  for salaries for our chief executive officer and the hiring of additional fulltime employees during the period from march   inception to december   robert smith has advanced the company a total of  to cover costs related to the organization and development of the company the advances are considered temporary in nature and was formalized by a promissory note there is no formal written commitment for continued support by mr smith the loan of

this related party advance as of december   the company has paidoff the promissory note in full with the remaining balance  there are numerous existing widely commercially available methods to provide power to rechargeable lowpower fixed and mobile devices including wall plugin recharging inductive recharging powermat recharging battery recharging stations and more to our knowledge almost all mobile consumer electronic devices equipped with a rechargeable battery come bundled with a method to recharge the device for example a power cord we believe that the main advantage of our ai aircharge technology as compared to traditional charging technologies will be the ability to charge multiple devices anywhere within the charging area expected to be upto  feet without the use of a charging pad we believe our technology is unique and flexible allowing us to concisely target a fixed or mobile device track that device if it moves or is moving and focus and transmit a stream of energy to the targeted device to charge the device without having to remove the battery or plug in the device we are not currently aware of any company or researcher looking to develop an ai aircharge technology that utilizes innovative ai algorithms and deep learning software to focus their directional antennas to target and deliver energy over distance there is a variety of other wireless charging technologies on the market or under development today these competitive technologies fall into the following categories magnetic induction magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance which can transmit energy over very short distances power is delivered as a function of coil size the larger the coil the more power and coils must be directly paired one receiver coil to one transmitter coil  directly coupled pair within a typical distance of less than one inch products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for  years in products such as rechargeable electronic toothbrushes magnetic resonance magnetic resonance is similar to magnetic induction as it uses magnetic coils to transmit energy this technology uses coils that range in size depending on the power levels being transmitted it has the ability to transmit power at distances up to  inches cm which can be increased with the use of resonance repeaters conductive conductive charging uses conductive power transfer to eliminate wires between the charger often a charging mat and the charging device it requires the use of a charging board as the power transmitter to deliver the power and a charging device with a builtin receiver to receive the power this technology requires direct metal contact between the charging board and the receiver once the charging board recognizes the receiver the charging begins ai aircharge this is at the core of our lifeline technology ai aircharge utilizes innovative ai algorithms and deep learning software to focus our directional antennas to target and deliver energy over distance to our knowledge there is no other company attempting to utilize a directional ai aircharge similar to that being developed by us laser laser charging technology uses very short wavelengths of light to create a collimated beam that maintains its size over distance using what is described as distributed resonance to deliver power to an optical receiver ultrasound ultrasound charging technology converts electric energy into acoustic energy in the form of ultrasound waves it then reconverts those waves through an “energyharvesting” receiver company description voice life is a development stage technology company that’s developing technology that can enable wirefree charging of electronic devices at a distance with complete mobility through innovative ai algorithms and deep learning software applications we intend to license our technology to various consumer electronics companies including automobile manufacturers component manufacturers oems odms and branded consumer electronics firms we believe strategic relationships with key automobile manufacturers and consumer electronics supply chain licensees will enable us to reap the benefits of our technology much faster than by manufacturing distributing or installing products ourselves  the company is currently focusing on the further development of its reference design products including its voice user interface algorithm wireless power distribution system composed of two interconnected products portable transmitter and an accessory receiver case which receives power from the transmitter creating wireless charging capabilities the company will seek to showcase the products currently under development including its new wirelessly powered light bulbs and music speakers in a residential home called the “smart home of the future today” the showcase will serve as a “voice controlled” smart home template for applying these wireless charging technologies and reference design products to any home our company is in the process of pursuing manufacturing and licensing arrangements for the products we are developing the company is also currently seeking to collaborate with major

before purchasing any of our common stock  all material risks are discussed in this section   risks related to our company   our having generated no revenues from operations makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance   as of december   we have generated no revenues and incurred a generated an accumulated deficit of  as a consequence it is difficult if not impossible to forecast our future results based upon our historical data  because of the related uncertainties we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues and expenses  if we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable data we may never become profitable or incur losses which may result in a decline in our stock price    we may be unable to continue paying the costs of being a reporting public company   the costs of being a public reporting company under the securities exchange act of  may be substantial and the company may not be able to absorb the costs of being a public company which may cause us to cease being public in the future or require additional fundraising in order to remain in business we estimate that in the future costs for legal and accounting at  per year    our auditor has indicated in its report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations   our auditor has indicated in its report that our lack of revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  the financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations   our certificate of incorporation and bylaws limit the liability of and provide indemnification for our officers and directors   our certificate of incorporation generally limits our officers’ and directors’ personal liability to the company and its stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer or director except for breach of the duty of loyalty or acts or omissions not made in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide indemnification for our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the nevada corporations code against all expense liability and loss including attorneys fees judgments fines excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement reasonably incurred or suffered by an officer or director in connection with any action suit or proceeding whether civil or criminal administrative or investigative hereinafter a  proceeding  to which the officer or director is made a party or is threatened to be made a party or in which the officer or director is involved by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of the company or is or was serving at the request of the company whether the basis of the proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as an officer or director or in any other capacity while serving as an officer or director thus the company may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the officers and directors for liabilities incurred in connection with their good faith acts for the company  such an indemnification payment might deplete the companys assets stockholders who have questions regarding the fiduciary obligations of the officers and directors of the company should consult with independent legal counsel it is the position of the securities and exchange commission that exculpation from and indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of  as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder is against public policy and therefore unenforceable      we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations    we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs  our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances loans andor financial guarantees there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully sell our equity or debt securities           the company may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding which may be unavailable   the company has limited capital resources and has not generated any revenue since inception unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern the company may experience liquidity and solvency problems such liquidity and solvency problems may force the company to cease operations if additional financing is not available no known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations   there is no minimum dollar amount that the company must raise in this offering thus investors purchasing our securities might own stock of a company that has insufficient funding to conduct planned operations   in order to implement the company’s plan of operations for the next twelve month period we require a minimum of  of funding from this offering we anticipate that after the initial twelve month period we may need additional financing if the company is unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely   expenses required to operate as a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition   operating as a public company is more expensive than operating as a private company including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance from legal accounting investor relations or other professionals that could be more costly than planned  we may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional sec reporting requirements  we anticipate that the cost of sec reporting will be approximately  annually  our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition  if we fail to meet these requirements we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the otc electronic bulletin board or if we have secured a qualification we may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the otc electronic bulletin board  further if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our sec reporting obligations investors will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly annual reports and other required sec reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming a nonreporting issuer   our lack of history makes evaluating our business difficult   we have a limited operating history and we may not sustain profitability in the future   to sustain profitability we must      develop our technologies to make them commercially viable      compete with larger more established competitors who offer similar more advanced technologies and are more capitalized than the company           maintain and enhance our brand recognition and      adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments   we may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives further our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects our prospects must be considered in light of the risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development particularly companies in highly competitive industries the historical information in this report may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance   risks related to our business   because we have a limited history of operations we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan   we have less than one year of operational history in our industry accordingly our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including access to capital successful implementation of our business plan and limited revenue from operations we cannot assure you that our intended activities or plan of operation will be successful or result in revenue or profit to us and any failure to implement our business plan may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company if we fail to effectively manage our growth our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected we may experience a rapid growth in operations which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure as we continue to grow we must effectively identify integrate develop and motivate new employees and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture to attract top talent we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages the risks of overhiring or over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability additionally if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our services could suffer which could adversely affect our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition if operational technology and infrastructure improvements are not implemented successfully our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues to effectively manage our growth we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures this will require that we refine our information technology systems to maintain effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers these system enhancements and improvements will require significant incremental and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources if we fail to implement these improvements and maintenance programs effectively our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses we depend heavily on key personnel and turnover of key senior management could harm our business our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our chief executive officer and chairman robert smith if we lose his services or if he fails to perform in his current position or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed our business could suffer significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete our institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team we depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the product acquisition marketing and sales aspects of our business any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future    our management has limited experience in managing the day to day operations of a public company and as a result we may incur additional expenses associated with the management of our company our chief executive officer and chairman robert smith is responsible for the operations and reporting of our company the requirements of operating as a small public company are new to our management this may require us to obtain outside assistance from legal accounting investor relations or other professionals that could be more costly than planned we may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional sec reporting requirements we anticipate that the costs associated with sec requirements associated with going and staying public are estimated to be approximately  in connection with this registration statement and thereafter  annually if we lack cash resources to cover these costs in the future our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations cash flow and financial condition after we commence operations our future results and reputation may be affected by litigation or other liability claims   we have not procured a general liability insurance policy for our business to the extent that we suffer a loss of a type which would normally be covered by general liability we would incur significant expenses in defending any action against us and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or judgment against us adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our business or our securities   we expect to need fcc approval for our technology which may be difficult to achieve and existing laws or regulations or future legislative or regulatory changes may affect our business   our remote charging technology involves the transmission of power using a combination light frequencies and radio frequency “rf” energy waves which are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission “fcc” and may be subject to regulation by other federal state and local agencies we intend to design our technology so that it will operate in the  ghz radio frequency ranges which are the same range as wifi routers and several other wireless consumer electronics we will be transmitting power using rf energy waves at ranges that we believe have never been used for consumer products before therefore we believe that we may require an fcc part  approval and there is no guarantee it will be granted   we may not be able to achieve all the product features we seek to include in our product   we have developed a prototype of our wireless power distribution system product that displays limited functionality in a real smart home setting there are a variety of features we seek to include in our product that we have not yet achieved for example our prototype transmitter is capable of sending some wattage to three devices while we believe recharging multiple devices on one transmitter at a commercially acceptable level may be possible theoretically we have not yet achieved these results even in the smart home setting we believe our research and development efforts will yield additional functionality over time however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving all the features we are targeting and our inability to do so may limit the appeal of our product to consumers   our industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change which may result in products or new solutions that are superior to our technology under development or other future products we may bring to market from time to time if we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands our products may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer   the consumer and commercial electronics industry in general and the power recharging and alternative recharging segments of that industry in particular are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies because our products are expected to have long development cycles we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands to compete successfully we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over well  established alternative solutions products and technologies as well as newer methods of power delivery and convince consumers and enterprises of the advantages of our products and technologies      we anticipate future losses and negative cash flow and it is uncertain if or when we will become profitable   we have not yet demonstrated our ability to generate revenue but we hope to produce some material revenues and operate on a profitable basis as a result we have incurred losses since our inception and even thou we expect to see some operating revenue in the foreseeable future losses and negative cash flow for foreseeable future is a possibility we expect to expend significant resources on hiring of personnel and startup costs including payroll and benefits product testing and development intellectual property development and prosecution marketing and promotion capital expenditures working capital general and administrative expenses and fees and expenses associated with this offering we expect to incur costs and expenses related to prototype development consulting costs laboratory development costs obtaining regulatory approvals required for our technology and reference product designs marketing and other promotional activities hiring of personnel and the continued development of relationships with strategic business partners we are attempting to obtain the necessary working capital for operations of which this offering is a part but we may not be able to obtain financing in a sufficient amount or at all we anticipate our losses will continue to increase from current levels during our development stage   traditional wall plugin recharging remains an inexpensive alternative to our technology under development also directly competing products are offered by powermat technologies energizer’s inductive charging business pureenergy solutions inc ecoupled and powercast corporation which have greater resources than us and are better established in the market than we are we cannot be certain which other companies may have already decided to or may in the future choose to enter our markets for example consumer electronics products companies may invest substantial resources in wireless power or other recharging technologies and may decide to enter our target markets successful developments of competitors that result in new approaches for recharging could reduce the attractiveness of our products or render them obsolete   our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies rapid technological development may render our technology under development or future products based on our technology obsolete many of our competitors have or may have greater corporate financial operational sales and marketing resources and more experience in research and development than we have we cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete we may not have or be able to raise or develop the financial resources technical expertise marketing distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies   our competitive position also depends on our ability to     · generate widespread awareness acceptance and adoption by the consumer and enterprise markets of our technology under development and future products      · design a product that may be sold at an acceptable price point;       develop new or enhanced technologies or features that improve the convenience efficiency safety or perceived safety and productivity of our technology under development and future products     · properly identify customer needs and deliver new products or product enhancements to address those needs;     · limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production;     · limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals;     · attract and retain qualified personnel;          · protect our inventions with patents or otherwise develop proprietary products and processes; and     · secure sufficient capital resources to expand both our continued research and development and sales and marketing efforts   if our technology under development is not or our future products are not competitive based on these or other factors our business would be harmed       it is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and we may not be able to ensure its protection   our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain maintain and protect the rights to the technologies used in our products patents provide uncertain protections and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property for example we may be unsuccessful in defending any patents we obtain against third party challenges   in addition to patents we expect to rely on a combination of trade secrets copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products if our rights are not properly protected  third parties could use our technology and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced because our industry is characterized by competing intellectual property we may be sued for violating the intellectual property rights of others  as the number of competitors in the market for wireless power and alternative recharging solutions increases and as the number of patents issued in this area grows the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources in addition any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations we could become subject to product liability claims product recalls and warranty claims that could be expensive divert management’s attention and harm our business   our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the marketing and sale of products used by consumers we may be held liable if our technology under development now or in the future causes injury or death or are found otherwise unsuitable during usage while we believe our technology is safe users could allege or possibly prove defects some of which could be alleged or proved to cause harm to users or others because we design our products to perform complex functions involving rf energy possibly in close proximity to users a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs a product liability claim any product recalls or excessive warranty claims whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or otherwise could negatively affect our sales or require a change in the design or manufacturing process any of which could harm our reputation and business harm our relationship with licensors of our products result in a decline in revenue and harm our business expanding our service offerings or number of offices may not be profitable   we may choose to develop products and services to offer developing new offerings involves inherent risks including      our inability to estimate demand for the new offerings      competition from more established market participants      a lack of market understanding      in addition expanding into new geographic areas andor expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture as well as assessing the demand in the applicable market   if our estimates related to expenditures and cash flow from operations are erroneous and we are unable to sell additional equity securities our business could fall short of expectations and you may lose your entire investment   our financial success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our managements estimates of expenditures and cash flow from operations if such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate we may not be able to carry out our business plan which could in a worstcase scenario result in the failure of our business and you losing your entire investment   we are subject to complex federal state local and other laws and regulations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our business is subject to various and sometimes complex laws and regulations in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits approvals and certificates from various federal state and local governmental authorities we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations in addition our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations these costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover our failure to comply with these laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   any change to government regulationadministrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability   the laws regulations policies or current administrative practices of any government body organization or regulatory agency in the united states or any other jurisdiction may be changed applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business   the actions policies or regulations or changes thereto of any government body or regulatory agency or other special interest groups may have a detrimental effect on us any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate andor our profitably   we expect to depend on consumer electronics supply chain firms to manufacture market and distribute our technology currently under development if these strategic partners fail to successfully manufacture market and distribute our technology in development our business will be materially harmed   we will not be able to control the efforts and resources these consumer electronics supply chain firms would devote to marketing our technology under development or other future products those third parties may not be able to successfully market and sell the products they develop based on our technology may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts and may not market those products at prices that will permit the products to develop achieve or sustain market acceptance   we do not yet have substantial assets or revenues and are largely dependent upon the proceeds of this offering to fully fund our business if we do not the sell shares in this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to complete our business or abandon them   we have limited capital resources to date the company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated sufficient cash from operations to be profitable unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern we may experience liquidity and solvency problems such liquidity and solvency problems may for us to cease operations if additional financing is not available no known alternative sources of funds are available to the company in the event it does not have adequate proceeds from this    offering however the company believes that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to satisfy operating requirements for the next twelve months   we may allocate the net proceeds from this offering in ways that differ from the estimates discussed in the section titled “use of proceeds” and with which you may not agree   the allocation of net proceeds of the offering set forth in the “use of proceeds” section below represents our estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions and our future revenues and expenditures the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors including market conditions cash generated by our operations business developments and related rate of growth we may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds and the alternate purposes for which the proceeds may be used are discussed in the section entitled “use of proceeds” below you may not have an opportunity to evaluate the economic financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use our proceeds as a result you and other stockholders may not agree with our decisions see “use of proceeds” for additional information   risks related to our common stock   due to the lack of a current public market for our stock investors may have difficulty in selling stock they purchase   prior to this offering no public trading market existed for the company’s securities there can be no assurance that a public trading market for the company’s common stock will develop or that a public trading market if develop will be sustained as a shell company the company’s common stock sold pursuant to this prospectus will be subject to restrictions on resale and will not be eligible for quotation on the over the counter bulletin board we intend upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the financial industry regulatory authority finra which operates the otc electronic bulletin board nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved thus it is anticipated that there will be little or no market for the shares until the company is eligible to have its common stock quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board and as a result an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder because there is none and may be no public market for the company’s stock the company may not be able to secure future equity financing which would have a material adverse effect on the company   furthermore when and if the company’s common stock is eligible for quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board there can also be no assurance as to the depth or liquidity of any market for the common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares   as a result investors could find it more difficult to trade or to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of the stock as compared to securities that are traded on the nasdaq trading market or on an exchange moreover an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder   investors may have difficulty in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state blue sky laws our common stock is currently not quoted on any market no market may ever develop for our common stock or if developed may not be sustained in the future the holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares accordingly even if we are successful in having the shares available for trading on the otcbb investors should consider any secondary market for the companys securities to be a limited one we intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a manual exemption this manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state    without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state however it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual the listing entry must contain  the names of issuers officers and directors  an issuers balance sheet and  a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations  we may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information  furthermore the manual exemption is a non issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities most of the accepted manuals are those published in standard and poors moodys investor service fitchs investment service and bests insurance reports and many states expressly recognize these manuals a smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals the following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption alabama georgia illinois kentucky louisiana montana south dakota tennessee vermont and wisconsin accordingly our shares should be considered totally illiquid which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares we will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock the sec has adopted regulations which generally define socalled “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exemptions  we anticipate that our common stock will become a “penny stock” and we will become subject to rule g under the exchange act or the “penny stock rule” this rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers for transactions covered by rule g a brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale as a result this rule may affect the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require delivery prior to any transaction in a penny stock of a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities finally monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock we do not anticipate that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the penny stock rule in any event even if our common stock were exempt from the penny stock rule we would remain subject to section b of the exchange act which gives the sec the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the sec finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest sales of our common stock under rule  could reduce the price of our stock there are zero  shares of our common stock held by nonaffiliates and  shares held by affiliates that rule  of the securities act of  defines as restricted securities  newly issued shares are being registered in this offering however all of the remaining shares will still be subject to the resale restrictions of rule   in general persons holding restricted securities including affiliates must hold their shares for a period of at least six months may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price  the availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock under rule  could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities because we do not have an audit or compensation committee shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors none of which are independent to perform these functions we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors  indeed we do not have any audit or compensation committee  these functions are performed by the board of directors as a whole  no    members of the board of directors are independent directors  thus there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions because we are a  “shell company”  the holders of our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on rule  and we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s until we cease being a  “shell company”   we are a  “shell company”  as that term is defined by the applicable federal securities laws  specifically because of the nature and amount of our assets and our very limited operations pursuant to applicable federal rules we are considered a  “shell company”   applicable provisions of rule  specify that during that time that we are a  “shell company”  and for a period of one year thereafter holders of our restricted securities can not sell those securities in reliance on rule  this restriction may have potential adverse effects on future efforts to form additional capital through unregistered offerings another implication of us being a shell company is that we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan as result one year after we cease being a shell company assuming we are current in our reporting requirements with the securities and exchange commission and have filed current  “form  information”  with the sec reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than  months holders of our restricted securities may then sell those securities in reliance on rule  provided however those holders satisfy all of the applicable requirements of that rule for us to cease being a  “shell company”  we must have more than nominal operations and more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents  shares purchased in this offering which will be immediately resalable and sales of all of our other shares if and when applicable restrictions against resale expire could have a depressive effect on the market price if any of our common stock and the shares we are offering   our chief executive officer and director owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions  our chief executive officer and chairman robert smith owns a majority outstanding voting securities as a result currently and after the offering he will possess a significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions their ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer there may not be funds available for net income because our chief executive officer and director maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and perquisites our chief executive officer and chairman robert smith owns a majority outstanding voting securities as a result there may not be funds available for net income because he maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and perquisites we may in the future issue additional shares of common stock which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value   our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of various series preferred stock  as of the date of this prospectus the company had  shares of common stock and  preferred series shares outstanding accordingly we may issue up to an additional  shares of common stock and  preferred series shares the future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   we are subject to compliance with securities law which exposes us to potential liabilities including potential rescission rights      we may offer to sell our common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as well as those of various state securities laws the basis for relying on such exemptions is factual that is the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering we may not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law instead we may elect to relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption including information provided by investor themselves   if any such offering did not qualify for such exemption an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired it is possible that if an investor should seek rescission such investor would succeed a similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the national securities markets improvement act of  if investors were successful in seeking rescission we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations additionally if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the sec and state securities agencies   antitakeover effects of certain provisions of nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of the company   though not now we may be or in the future we may become subject to nevada’s control share law a corporation is subject to nevada’s control share law if it has more than  stockholders at least  of whom are stockholders of record and residents of nevada and it does business in nevada or through an affiliated corporation the law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient but for the control share law to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors i onefifth or more but less than onethird ii onethird or more but less than a majority or iii a majority or more the ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect as well as individual or in association with others   the effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person and those acting in association with it obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders the control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders thus there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved if the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person those shares do not become permanent nonvoting shares the acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others if the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest their shares do not become governed by the control share law if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power any stockholder of record other than an acquiring person who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder’s shares   nevada’s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation   in addition to the control share law nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between nevada corporations and “interested stockholders” for three years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder” unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in advance for purposes of nevada law an “interested stockholder” is any person who is i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or ii an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation the definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquiror to use the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders   the effect of nevada’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors      there is no current established trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares   there is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or if developed may not be sustained  while we intend to seek a quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board there can be no assurance that any such trading market will develop and purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so no market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so   because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them   we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future unless we pay dividends our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them there is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired   optin right for emerging growth company   we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   implications of being an emerging growth company   as a company with less than  billion in revenue during its last fiscal year we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act for as long as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies  these provisions include      a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related managements discussion and analysis included in an initial public offering registration statement      an exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement      an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal controls over financial reporting      an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies      an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the public company accounting oversight board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer an      reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements       an emerging growth company is also exempt from section b of sarbanes oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall in the same report attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the    internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting similarly as a smaller reporting company we are exempt from section b of the sarbanesoxley act and our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until such time as we cease being a smaller reporting company   as an emerging growth company we are exempt from section a a and b of the securities exchange act of  which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes   section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards  in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies  we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period  our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of      the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering      the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are  billion or more      the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt securities or      as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeded  million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year   you may have limited access to information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the sec could be automatically suspended under certain circumstances     as of effectiveness of our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part we will be required to file periodic reports with the sec which will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying see “where you can find more information” elsewhere in this prospectus  except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may in our discretion be automatically suspended under section d of the exchange act if we have less than  shareholders and do not file a registration statement on form a which we have no current plans to file  if this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the sec and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted  after this registration statement on form s becomes effective we will be required to deliver periodic reports to security holders  however we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the sec pursuant to section  of the exchange act  previously a company with more than  shareholders of record and  million in assets had to register under the exchange act  however the jobs act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from  to either  persons or  persons who are not accredited investors or  persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies  the jobs act excludes securities received by employees pursuant to employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold  this means that access to information regarding our business and operations will be limited   the offering price of the common shares being registered has been arbitrarily determined by us and bears no relationship to any criteria of value as such investors should not consider the offering price or value to be an indication of the value of the shares being registered   currently there is no public market for our common stock  the offering price for the common shares being registered in this registration statement has been arbitrarily determined by us and is not based on assets operations    book or other established criteria of value  thus investors should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the market price or value of our common shares   upon effectiveness of this registration statement we will be subject to the d reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of  which does not require a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting companies   upon effectiveness of this registration statement we will be subject to the d reporting requirements according to the securities exchange act of  as a section d filer we will be required to file quarterly and annual reports during the fiscal year in which our registration statement is declared effective however such duty to file reports shall be suspended as to any fiscal year other than the fiscal year within which such registration statement became effective if at the beginning of such fiscal year the securities of each class are held of record by less than  persons  in addition as a filer subject to section d of the exchange act we are not required to prepare proxy or information statements our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private regulations we will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules our officers directors and more than ten  percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company that these persons will not be subject to the shortswing profit recovery provisions of the exchange act and that more than five percent  holders of classes of our equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions in the securities as such shareholders will not have access to certain material information which would otherwise be required if it was a fully reporting company pursuant to an exchange act registration     if we are not required to continue filing reports under section d of the securities exchange act of  in the future for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective and we do not file a registration statement on form a our common shares if listed or quoted would no longer be eligible for quotation which could reduce the value of your investment   as a result of this offering as required under section d of the securities exchange act of  we will file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission as required under section d  however if in the future we are not required to continue filing reports under section d for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective and we do not file a registration statement on form a upon the occurrence of such an event our common stock can no longer be quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board which could reduce the value of your investment  of course there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the requirements to be able to cease filing reports under section d in which case we will continue filing those reports in the years after the fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective  filing a registration statement on form a will require us to continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the sec and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the sec  in addition our officers directors and  stockholders will be required to submit reports to the sec on their stock ownership and stock trading activity          use of proceeds   our offering is being

for additional employees       the above figures represent only estimated costs this expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the status of and results from operations as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period we require a minimum of  of funding from this offering we anticipate that after the initial twelve month period we many need additional funding   in the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority      for general administrative expenses including legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the sec         for office lease expenses and office equipment      for sales and marketing and      for salaries for our chief executive officer and the hiring of additional fulltime employees     during the period from march   inception to december   robert smith has advanced the company a total of  to cover costs related to the organization and development of the company the advances are considered temporary in nature and was formalized by a promissory note there is no formal written commitment for continued support by mr smith the loan of  advanced to the company by mr smith is unsecured noninterest bearing and will become due and payable upon demand from the lender proceeds raised in this offering will be used to repay some or all of this related party advance as of december   the company has paidoff the promissory note in full with the remaining balance     determination of the offering price   our management has determined the offering price for the common shares being sold in this offering the price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined the offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets earnings book value or other criteria of value the factors considered were      our status as a developmental stage “startup” company      costs associated with the continued development of our technologies into a commercialized status      our forecasted future prospects and      our current capital structure   therefore the public offering price of the shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of prices that may prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market for the common stock you cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering price in this offering such offering price does not have any relationship to any established criteria of value such as book value or earnings per share because we have no significant operating history the price of our common stock is not based on past earnings nor is the price of our common stock indicative of the current market value of the assets owned by us no valuation or appraisal has been prepared for our business and potential business expansion our common stock is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market you cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering price in this offering   dilution   if you purchase any of the shares offered by this prospectus your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share and the postoffering net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share is substantially in excess of the book value per share attributable to the existing stockholder for the presently outstanding stock as of december   our net tangible book value was  or  per share of common stock net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets    excluding deferred offering costs less total liabilities divided by  the number of shares of common stock outstanding at december     the following table sets forth as of december   the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholder and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase    or  of

postoffering net tangible book value as of december   would be  or  per share this amount represents an immediate increase in the postoffering net tangible book value of  per share to our existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in the postoffering net tangible book value of approximately  per share to new investors purchasing common shares in this offering we determine dilution by subtracting the as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of common stock      selling security holders   there are no selling security holders for this offering   plan of distribution   this prospectus relates to the sale  million common shares   we do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions we will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no one has agreed to buy any of our common shares this prospectus permits our ceo to sell the common shares directly to the public with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for any common shares he may sell there is no plan or arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the common shares with a broker or dealer our ceo will sell the common shares and intends to offer them to friends family members and business acquaintances there is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of our common shares will go into escrow trust or another similar arrangement   the common shares are being offered by mr robert smith the company’s chief executive officer and director will be relying on the safe harbor in rule a of the securities exchange act of  to sell the common shares no sales commission will be paid for common shares sold by mr smith mr smith is not subject to a statutory disqualification and is not associated persons of a broker or dealer   additionally mr smith primarily performs substantial duties on behalf of the registrant otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities mr smith has not been a broker or dealer or an associated person of a broker or dealer within the preceding  months and they have not participated in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every  months other than in reliance on paragraph ai or aiii of rule a of the securities exchange act of    the offering will commence on the effective date of this prospectus and will terminate on or before the earliest event of the sale of the maximum offering the termination of the offering by company management or the passage of one  year   there are no finders     under the rules of the securities and exchange commission our common stock will come within the definition of a “penny stock” because the price of our common stock is below  per share as a result our common stock will be subject to the penny stock rules and regulations brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the commission’s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock these regulations require brokerdealers to    make a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser  receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction and  provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser   these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability to resell our common stock   otc bulletin board considerations   to be quoted on the otc bulletin board a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock we anticipate that after this registration statement is declared effective market makers will enter “piggyback” quotes and our securities will thereafter trade on the otc bulletin board   the otc bulletin board is separate and distinct from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the otc bulletin board the sec’s order handling rules which apply to nasdaqlisted securities do not apply to securities quoted on the otc bulletin board          although the nasdaq stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards the otc bulletin board has no listing standards rather it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system files the application and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files finra cannot deny an application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company the only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that the issuer be current in its reporting requirements with the sec   although we anticipate listing on the otc bulletin board will increase liquidity for our stock investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because it is anticipated that if our stock trades on a public market it initially will trade on the otc bulletin board rather than on nasdaq investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed trading activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with nasdaqlisted securities   investors must contact a brokerdealer to trade otc bulletin board securities investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service for bulletin board securities there only has to be one market maker   bulletin board transactions are conducted almost entirely manually because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board they are conducted via telephone in times of heavy market volume the limitations of this process may result in a significant increase in the time it takes to execute investor orders therefore when investors place market orders  an order to buy or sell a specific number of shares at the current market price  it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse of time between placing a market order and getting execution   because bulletin board stocks are usually not followed by analysts there may be lower trading volume than for nasdaqlisted securities   there is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the otc bulletin board   blue sky law considerations   the holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares accordingly even if we are successful in having the shares available for trading on the otcbb investors should consider any secondary market for the companys securities to be a limited one there is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the otc bulletin board  we intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a manual exemption” this manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state however it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual the listing entry must contain  the names of issuers officers and directors  an issuers balance sheet and  a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations we may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information furthermore the manual exemption is a non issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities most of the accepted manuals are those published in standard and poors moodys investor service fitchs investment service and bests insurance reports and many states expressly recognize these manuals a smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals the following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption alabama georgia illinois kentucky louisiana montana south dakota tennessee vermont and wisconsin   we currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other states which require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders    subscription process      you may purchase shares by completing and manually

without shareholder approval and in the manner provided by law to fix and determine in a resolution the classes series and number of each class or series of preferred stock such preferred stock if

funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our results of operations financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant   share eligible for future sale   prior to this offering there was no public market for our common stock we cannot predict the effect if any that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on    the market price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities   we have outstanding an aggregate of  shares of our common stock of these shares only the  to be registered in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act unless those shares are purchased by our affiliates as that term is defined in rule  under the securities act   the remaining  shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of

certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us     penny stock considerations   our shares will be penny stocks as that term is generally defined in the securities exchange act of  to mean equity securities with a price of less than  thus our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice    and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale unless the brokerdealer is otherwise exempt   in addition under the penny stock regulations the brokerdealer is required to      deliver prior to any transaction involving a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the securities and exchange commission relating to the penny stock market unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt      disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities      send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customers account the accounts value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks and      make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customers account   because of these regulations brokerdealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market these additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities if our securities become publicly traded in addition the liquidity for our securities may be decreased with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will in all likelihood find it difficult to sell their securities   interest of named experts   the financial statements for the period from inception to december   included in this

enable wirefree charging of multiple electronic devices at a distance with freedom of movement since inception we have generated an accumulated deficient in the amount of    current operations   the company is a development stage technology company focused on developing technology and reference design products and have developed is a beta system consisting of a base station transmitter a smart phone receiver case receiver test boards and management software these reference design products once completed will enable smart    home connected devices to be powered wirelessly and controlled thru voice by providing convenient adaptive wireless power charging capabilities to low power fixed and mobile devices such as mobile phones tablets toys videogame controllers watches remote controls smoke alarms window covering deployment and retraction motors installed sensors and night and emergency lighting fixtures that use or are capable of using a rechargeable battery our goal is to create a wireless powered smart home with products being both wirelessly powered and charged and are activated through voice control systems the company will seek to target both consumer and commercial enterprise markets that use such rechargeable fixed and mobile devices     the two reference design products of the company are a portable transmitter about the size of a deck of cards which creates a “d” optical window to one or many receivers connected to electronic devices such as a smart phone which then receives its power from the “d” optical window the transmitter locates the receiver in a d optical space the transmitter then generates an invisible wavelength the “optical window” around the receiver the receiver chip gathers power from the d optical window and is able to charge recharge battery devices or power up to watt devices that otherwise need battery connection from a power outlet we are developing voice user interface algorithm for the management and control of our products   other than the current receiver and transmitter voice life inc is in the process of designing three additional reference design prototypes all fivereference designs prototypes will be showcased in the smart home the additional products include led “transceiver light bulb music speaker wireless powered receiver and oled display wireless power receiver however we believe that the technology upon which these reference design prototypes is based can potentially be utilized in a variety of other devices as well including tablets remote controls rechargeable lights and any other device with similar recharging capabilities that would otherwise require batteries or electrical outlets   although we have no formal agreements in place we intend to source raw materials and other supplies from

products and reach their wide audience our relationship with amazon is that of a standard apps development and services developer we have not negotiated any specialized unique or exclusive contracts with amazon     growth strategy      the company’s plan for the future includes developing products using voice user interface algorithm wireless power distribution system composed of two interconnected products a portable transmitter and an accessory receiver case which receives power from the transmitter creating wireless charging capabilities the company will showcase these products along with its new wirelessly powered light bulbs and music speakers in a residential smart home the showcase will serve as a “voice controlled” smart home template for applying these wireless charging technologies and products to any home our company is in the process of pursuing manufacturing and licensing because there are several markets in which our technology can be used     other than the current receiver and transmitter voice life inc is in the process of designing three additional products all five products will be showcased in the smart home the additional products include led “transceiver light bulb music speaker wireless powered receiver and oled display wireless power receiver however we believe that our technology can potentially be utilized in a variety of other devices as well including tablets remote controls rechargeable lights and any other device with similar recharging capabilities that would otherwise require batteries or electrical outlets   target markets   we believe that our technology will be compelling to many end markets each of which may have several potential customers in an effort to focus our activities we have selected certain initial target markets based on the potential value we would be able to create in these markets as we continue to develop our technology we may find that it creates more value in other markets if that is the case we intend to shift our focus to those other markets   we identify our initial target markets within these two hardware categories transmitters and receivers   transmitter target markets we believe our ai aircharge transmitter technology will be developed and released to the consumer in three basic categories   • standalone transmitters that are either sold independently or bundled as part of a ai aircharge with a lifeline enabled receiver device • transmitters that are integrated into third party devices like automobiles televisions  computer monitor bezels sound bars led light bulb etc • transmitters that are integrated with wifi routers to form a single device that provides both connectivity and wirefree power   standalone transmitters  our current plans call for standalone transmitters to be released in three separate and distinct categories   near field transmitters   because of the distinct advantages compared to other existing forms of contactbased wireless charging including ease of manufacturing and relative ease of regulatory approval we expect that products using our near field transmitter technology will be the first enabled products on the market our near field transmitters are ideally suited for wearables iot devices and other small electronics which require a small form factor receiver and a lowcost charging solution these small inexpensive transmitters will likely be usbpowered and will have a range of up to five millimeters these solutions will initially be onetoone one transmitter to one receiver with followon versions being one transmitter to multiple receivers   mid field portable transmittersreceiver   we expect that our portable mid field transmitters will be geared to the notebook ipad and automotive markets and will likely have is very scalable vary from contactbased charging up to  feet we also intend for the mid field transmitters to have tracking ability to support mobile applications and multiple receiving devices likely implementations of midsized transmitters will include small portable transmittersreceiver designed to send low power at distances for accessories and wearables the same technology may also likely be integrated into third party devices like automobiles led light bulb computer monitor bezels nightstand consumer electronics accessories such as low voltage portable battery chargers and integrated automotive applications the size and number of transmitters determine the power and distance delivered   far field transmitters    far field power transmitters are fullfeatured transmitters with the power to charge multiple devices at distances of up to  feet or anywhere within a foot diameter circle we also expect that far field transmitters will have the ability to “connect” with other far field transmitters allowing the user to create a large charging envelope encompassing many different rooms or large spaces while seamlessly providing charging to mobile devices that are moving through the coverage space far field transmitters may also play a significant role in the powering of iot devices that are fixed such as security cameras and sensors these may also be charged from an ai aircharge enabled wifi router or led light bulb which adds rfbased chargingatadistance functionality   transmitters integrated into third party devices   the “building block” core architecture developed for the ai aircharge technology is ideally suited to a broad spectrum of third party devices like automobile televisions and led light bulb the flexibility of the architecture in terms of size power distance and cost affords voice life licensees the opportunity to match our technology with specific requirements and limitations typically found with complex integrations for example the ai aircharge technology could be integrated into autonomous automobiles led light bulb that are typically found in every home or office providing charging capabilities to mobile devices anywhere in the room further the capabilities of the transmitter technology could enable licensees to develop venuespecific consumer electronics products like integrated televisions that are paired with integrated led light bulb to provide mobile charging across a large room such as an airport lounge   wifi routers   we see the combination of the ai aircharge wirefree power router and the wifi router as a natural integration point and a synergistic application of both technologies the ai aircharge wirefree power router shares a number of technical characteristics with wifi routers in that both devices operate in the airwaves in the unlicensed industrial scientific and medical “ism” bands both devices owe their success to the utility and convenience they bring to the consumer both devices rely on antenna structures to send power and data and both devices “ai connected” or provide hand off capabilities which allow for large “enabled” sites similar to a mesh network we also believe that our ai aircharge technology may enhance the data signal and distance of a wifi router which we believe will provide an even stronger value proposition to wireless data router manufacturers   the wifi router market has two segments commercial and residential the key differentiator between these segments is that commercial routers tend to have much more robust security features including virtual private networks and advanced content filtering we believe that our technology is applicable to both the commercial and residential wifi router markets based on the building block capabilities mentioned earlier that will provide a ai aircharge transmission that will enable the technology to effectively serve and support both markets   in addition the wifi router market has other key players these include consumer electronics supply chain firms including original equipment manufacturers “oems” original design manufacturers “odms” component manufacturers and branded consumer electronics firms we believe that each of these categories of players can help to integrate our technology into a commercially available wifi router   an odm designs products either collaboratively with their customers or on their own and manufactures them for sale to companies under the end customer’s brand additionally an odm may engage multiple companies with similar designs that are then marketed under several customers’ brands an oem manufactures products for sale under another firm’s brand   receiver target markets   we believe there is a wide variety of a potential use for our receiver technology that utilizes our transmitters • smartphones • hearing aids • iot devices • wearables • tablets • mice • gaming consoles and controllers • keyboards • ebook readers • remote controls • sensors such as thermostats • toys • rechargeable batteries • rechargeable lights • automotive accessories • personal care products such as toothbrushes or shavers • retail inventory management such as rfid tags • handheld industrial devices such as scanners or keypads • medical devices   this list is meant for illustrative purposes only we cannot guarantee that we will address any of these markets and we may decide to address a market that is not on the above list we intend to continuously evaluate our target markets and choose new markets based on factors including but not limited to timetomarket market size and growth and the strength of our value proposition for a specific application our competition   there are numerous existing widely commercially available methods to provide power to rechargeable lowpower fixed and mobile devices including wall plugin recharging inductive recharging powermat recharging battery recharging stations and more to our knowledge almost all mobile consumer electronic devices equipped with a rechargeable battery come bundled with a method to recharge the device for example a power cord   we believe that the main advantage of our ai aircharge technology as compared to traditional charging technologies will be the ability to charge multiple devices anywhere within the charging area expected to be upto  feet without the use of a charging pad we believe our technology is unique and flexible allowing us to concisely target a fixed or mobile device track that device if it moves or is moving and focus and transmit a stream of energy to the targeted device to charge the device without having to remove the battery or plug in the device   we are not currently aware of any company or researcher looking to develop an ai aircharge technology that utilizes innovative ai algorithms and deep learning software to focus their directional antennas to target and deliver energy over distance   there is a variety of other wireless charging technologies on the market or under development today these competitive technologies fall into the following categories   magnetic induction magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance which can transmit energy over very short distances power is delivered as a function of coil size the larger the coil the more power and coils must be directly paired one receiver coil to one transmitter coil  directly coupled pair within a typical distance of less than one inch products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for  years in products such as rechargeable electronic toothbrushes   magnetic resonance magnetic resonance is similar to magnetic induction as it uses magnetic coils to transmit energy this technology uses coils that range in size depending on the power levels being transmitted it has the ability to transmit power at distances up to  inches cm which can be increased with the use of resonance repeaters   conductive conductive charging uses conductive power transfer to eliminate wires between the charger often a charging mat and the charging device it requires the use of a charging board as the power transmitter to deliver the power and a charging device with a builtin receiver to receive the power this technology requires direct metal contact between the charging board and the receiver once the charging board recognizes the receiver the charging begins   ai aircharge this is at the core of our lifeline technology ai aircharge utilizes innovative ai algorithms and deep learning software to focus our directional antennas to target and deliver energy over distance to our knowledge there is no other company attempting to utilize a directional ai aircharge similar to that being developed by us   laser laser charging technology uses very short wavelengths of light to create a collimated beam that maintains its size over distance using what is described as distributed resonance to deliver power to an optical receiver   ultrasound ultrasound charging technology converts electric energy into acoustic energy in the form of ultrasound waves it then reconverts those waves through an “energyharvesting” receiver   intellectual property   we are pursuing an aggressive intellectual property strategy and are developing new patents at present we have no patents issued or pending and we do not have any trademarks licenses franchises concessions and royalty agreements labor contracts or other proprietary interests we will seek to have our technologies submitted for patent protection in the united states should the requisite funds become available we have identified more than  specific inventions we believe to be novel and patentable there can be no guarantee however that our products will be approved for patent protection   we expect to rely on a combination of trade secrets copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products   research and development   the company’s ceo and sole director has spent  of his personal funds in nonrecurring engineering expenses on the research and development of a prototype for the company’s wireless power distribution product our ceo has developed the prototype himself the development work occurred between january   and march  and is an ongoing work in progress voice life inc acquired ownership of the product from the developer robert smith pursuant to the technology assignment and transfer agreement  see exhibit  hereto    the prototype we have developed is a beta system consisting of a base station transmitter a smart phone receiver case receiver test boards and management software and we are developing technology that can enable wireless charging or powering of electronic devices at distance the beta system has validated the technology in our labs utilizing commercially available parts and components which have not been optimized and may be too large to be incorporated into commercially marketed products we are developing multiple generations of transmitter and receiver application specific integrated circuits “asics” that we believe will optimize our technology by reducing size and cost while increasing performance to a level that we believe will allow for them to be integrated into lowpower devices defined as devices requiring less than  watts thereby eliminating the need for a charging cord or pad to maintain a charge   in order to demonstrate the capability of our technology to potential partners we are currently developing complete products for potential licensees who will modify and remanufacture the products to fit their own needs these products are known as “reference designs” of our integrated solution the company’s strategy is to attempt to license these reference designs to key potential partners which we believe will allow them to speed up incorporation of technology into their product lines create awareness and demand and bring our power solution to market faster our initial reference designs currently under development are being designed for use with smart phones   as of sdecember   the company has four products that are in various stages of development one product “receiver case” is in production but has not yet recorded any revenues while the remaining three products are in various stages of development     governmental regulation   we require federal communication commission approval for our technology which may be difficult to achieve and existing laws or regulations or future legislative or regulatory changes may affect our business our remote charging technology involves the transmission of power using a combination light frequencies and radio frequency “rf” energy waves which are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission “fcc” we intend to design our technology so that it will operate in the  ghz radio frequency ranges which are the same range as wifi routers and several other wireless consumer electronics therefore we must meet part  requirements and approval and may require fcc part  approval   as ofdecember   the company has four products that are in various stages of development one product “receiver case” is in production but has not yet recorded any revenues while the remaining three products are in various stages of development   fcc permits   in the united states the federal communications commission fcc is responsible for the regulation of all rf devices the fcc requires any device that radiates rf energy to be tested for compliance with fcc rules part  is the section of the code that deals with devices that emit rf energy and are to be operated without an individual license   certain bands within the rf spectrum are available for “unlicensed” operation the term “unlicensed” is often misunderstood the manufacturer of a product designed for “unlicensed” operation is not exempt from testing andor certification indeed both the transmitter and receiver must be tested by a qualified testing laboratory however once the necessary approvals are received the end user can then operate the product without further obligation or licensing wireless charging devices can be approved under part  or part  or both rule parts   while devices operating upon unlicensed bands do not require fcc licensing they are not unregulated and must meet the federal code of regulation cfr fcc part  which is a common testing standard for most electronic equipment fcc part  covers the regulations under which an intentional unintentional or incidental radiator that can be operated without an individual license fcc part  covers as well the technical specifications administrative requirements and other conditions relating to the marketing of fcc part  devices our waveform operates in the  ghz radio frequency range which is the same range as wifi routers and several other wireless consumer electronics for those types of products the fcc grants part  approval if among other things    the specific absorption rate  “sar”  is below certain thresholds based on our preliminary calculations the sar at our receiver should be well below that of a typical cellular signal so we believe we will be able to gain fcc part  approval for our prototypes currently in development   once our product is in its finished form exactly as it will be produced testing will be conducted by a properly approved laboratory in most cases it is not necessary to be present for testing and the laboratory will prepare the filing paperwork we are not currently aware of any requirement that we believe will result in a failure of our product to obtain an fcc part  compliance certificate in addition because our technology involves the transmission of power greater than the power threshold limits of part  we also expect to need to obtain fcc part  approval fcc part  is the section of title  of the code of federal regulations that provides the federal communications commission fcc with authority to regulate industrial scientific and medical equipment ism that emits electromagnetic energy on frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum upon request by a representative of the commission the manufacturer owner or operator of any ism equipment shall make the equipment available for inspection and promptly furnish the commission with such information as may be required to indicate that the equipment complies with fcc part  process compliance with fcc part  requires the product to be designed with sufficient shielding and filtering to provide adequate suppression of emissions on frequencies outside of the allowed frequency bands it is our expectation based on similar products and designs developed by our manufacturer that we will use our manufacturer’s expertise in the fcc approval process and will work closely with them to conduct and complete these certification tests it is our expectation based on similar products and designs by other companies that our manufacturer shenzhen xinliyang technology co ltd will conduct and complete these certification tests as part of the company’s standard course of business and planning process and from start to finish should be completed in approximately  months following the completion of the certification testing we expect again based on the experience of our manufacturer it to take an additional  months to have the product approved by the fcc shenzhen xinliyang technology co ltd was established in  it is an “allinone hightech enterprise” that specializes in rd innovation design engineering realization manufacturing and knight service it has a  square meters production facility in shenzhen city and  employees including  engineers it is an iso approved factory with  production lines monthly capacity is about  pcs moreover the laws regulations policies or current administrative practices of any government body organization or regulatory agency in the united states or any other jurisdiction may be changed applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business the actions policies or regulations or changes thereto of any government body or regulatory agency or other special interest groups may have a detrimental effect on us any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate andor our profitably   description of property   currently our principal executive offices are located at  warner avenue suite

be determined by the board of directors and shall hold his office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal   potential conflicts of interest since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors thus there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors   director independence our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities as a result of this review our board of directors determined that our directors do not meet the independence requirements according to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec   corporate governance   there have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors in addition to having no nominating committee for that purpose we currently have no

officers and directors as a group to the best of our knowledge the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares except as otherwise noted there are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control   the information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose under these rules a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security a person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within  days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security warrant option or other right more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities the percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days consequently the denominator used for calculating such

incorporated in nevada on march   we are located in huntington beach california the company is a development stage technology company that’s developing technology that can enable wirefree charging of electronic devices at a distance with complete mobility through innovative ai algorithms and deep learning software applications   we intend to license our technology to various consumer electronics companies including component manufacturers oems odms and branded consumer electronics firms we believe strategic relationships with key consumer electronics supply chain licensees will enable us to reap the benefits of our technology much faster than by manufacturing distributing or installing products ourselves while we do not now have license revenue our strategy depends on the development of successful commercial products and effectively licensing our technology into the consumer enterprise and commercial markets we will need to understand procurement and buying cycles to be successful in licensing our technology into those markets   in our operating history we have developed a beta system consisting of a base station transmitter a smart phone receiver case receiver test boards and management software in addition we have designed and submitted for manufacturing an application specific integrated circuit “asic” to optimize our transmitter technology furthermore we have designed but not yet submitted for manufacturing an asic to optimize our receiver technology in connection with the receiver technology we have designed multiple smart phone charging cases which are still under development complementing our hardware designs we have developed a ai software application that we believe allows for management control statistics and prioritization of the charging for the remote devices via a smartphone tablet or pc    the wireless charging solution we are developing employs use of ai and deep learning on a gpuaccelerated platform our ai lab consists azure nseries that includes  gpuaccelerated server  gpus •  cores azure ncbased instances are powered by nvidia tesla® k gpus and provide the compute power required to accelerate the most demanding highperformance computing hpc        we are pursuing an aggressive intellectual property strategy and are developing new patents at present we have no patents issued or no pending patents and we do not have any trademarks licenses franchises concessions and royalty agreements labor contracts or other proprietary interests we will seek to have our technologies submitted for patent protection in the united states should the requisite funds become available we have identified more than  specific inventions we believe to be novel and patentable there can be no guarantee however that our products will be approved for patent protection   we expect to rely on a combination of trade secrets copyright and trademark laws nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products   we in the process of recruiting a seasoned management team with public company and relevant industry experience to develop and execute our operating plan in addition we have identified and will be adding additional engineering resources which we expect ultimately will build up the engineering capability of our internal team upon being effective finally we have started the selection process for the independent members of our board of directors which we intend to rely upon for valuable assistance in terms of industry credibility corporate governance and strategic direction   since march   inception through december   we have generated no revenue in the amount against total expenses of  for a net loss in the amount of  from january   through december   we have generated no revenue against total expenses of  for a net loss in the amount of  we have generated an accumulated deficit in the amount of  for the period march   inception through period ending december     our expenses during the past  months are primarily attributed to organizing the company and this offering as well as researching and developing its product reference design prototypes the increase in loss from operations resulted primarily from asic development other research and development and consultant fees as well as the legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with compliance with our sec reporting obligations   to date our operations have been funded through the sale of our preferred series stock which is convertible upon effectiveness to common shares   the amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the pace of progress of our development and licensing efforts unexpected difficulties arising in the process of protecting our intellectual property market conditions and changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies in addition we may use a portion of any net proceeds to acquire complementary products technologies or businesses however we do not have plans for any acquisitions at this time we will have significant discretion in the use of any net proceeds investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of our common stock   plan of operations   we plan to continue to focus on the development of remote charging technology with our current goal being to further develop and license this technology to consumer electronics supply chain firms or manufacturers and developers of other devices that would benefit from remote charging we intend to pursue licensing because we believe there are several market verticals to which the remote charging technology can apply and we believe that this is the most capitalefficient manner in which we can address many of them at once as we develop new applications for the technology we expect to target new strategic relationships in different market sectors   we originally expected that our remote charging technology will be ready for production and made commercially available to potential licensees during the third quarter of  the reasons for the delay include some changes and modifications to the reference designs and to a more advanced ai enable silicon chip which has required further testing and change in the manufacturing final design we now expect that our remote charging technology will be ready for production and made commercially available to potential licensees during the third or fourth quarter of    since we are a development stage company we have not yet finalized some aspects of our strategy for example we may decide to sell our wireless charging products ourselves in addition to licensing the design of these products that decision would depend if we could get a capital partner and we believe selling the products ourselves we could meet the market demand of potential customers   we expect to use the net proceeds received from this offering to continue our remote charging technology development develop product reference designs complete certification testing protect our intellectual property pursue licensing partners and for working capital and other general corporate purposes           we are highly dependent on the success of this offering to execute upon this proposed plan of operations if we are unable to raise sufficient funds through this offering or obtain alternate financing in lieu of funds raised through this offering we may never complete development and become profitable in order to become profitable we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding above and beyond what we are seeking to raise through this offering to such end we hope to be able to raise additional funds from an offering of our stock in the future however this offering may not occur or if it occurs it may not raise the required funding we do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding at present   results of operations   revenues to date we have not generated any revenues   operating expenses and loss from operations  operating expenses include general administrative expenses legal fees and research and development expenses loss from operations for the period march   thru december   for the period

period ending december   our cash balance is  with  in liabilities general and administrative expenses include costs for general and corporate functions including facility fees travel telecommunications insurance professional fees consulting fees and other overhead our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time without further revenue or proceed from this offering we have utilized funds from robert smith our chief executive officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees mr smith however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period we require a minimum of  of funding from our preferred series offering after the initial twelve month period we may need additional financing we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing      for the period march   inception thru december   operating expenses and loss from operations  during the period from march   inception to december   we generated no revenues and incurred expenses of  our operating expenses consist of the costs incurred in organizing the company and this offering as well as developing its reference designs product prototypes this constitutes an aggregate loss of    for the period january   thru december   operating expenses and loss from operations  during the period from january   to december   we generated no revenues and incurred expenses of    net loss  as a result of the above net loss for the  months ending december   was  compared to  nine months ending  the increase in loss from operations resulted primarily from asic development other research and development and consultant fees as well as the legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with compliance with our sec reporting obligations

development of our reference design product prototype the increase in loss from operations resulted primarily from asic development other research and development and consultant fees as well as the legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with compliance with our sec reporting obligations to meet our need for cash we are raising money from sale of convertible preferred series shares the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan if we are unable to successfully implement our business plan we may need to find alternative funding sources we have commenced a private placement offering of the sale of convertible preferred series shares as of august   the period from march   through december   the registrant has received proceeds of  from six investors the period from january   through december   the registrant has received proceeds of  from twenty three distinct investors thus from march   inception through december   the registrant has received proceeds of  from twenty nine distinct investors the registrant expects the sale of the preferred series shares to convert to common shares upon sec effectiveness if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely   purchase and sale of equipment   we presently have no equipment   income  operation taxes   we are subject to income taxes in the us   net loss   from the period from march   through december   we incurred net losses of  from the period from january   to december   we incurred net losses of  during the period from march   inception to december   we generated no revenues and incurred net loses of  these losses are mainly due to the costs involved in the organization of the company and costs incurred in research and development of its reference designs product prototypes   controls and procedures   we are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls we will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the sarbanesoxley act for the fiscal year ended december   as of the date of this prospectus we have not completed an assessment nor have our auditors tested our systems of internal controls   because it will take time management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operations we may incur significant expense in meeting our public reporting responsibilities particularly in the areas of designing enhancing or remediating internal and disclosure controls doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting   once our management’s report on internal controls is complete we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report when required under section  of the sarbanesoxley act the independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning our operations while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting      offbalance sheet arrangements commitments and contractual obligations   as of december   we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations   development stage and capital resources       since its inception the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning research and development recruiting management and staff and raising capital accordingly the company is considered to be in the development stage the company has generated minimal revenues from operations and therefore lacks meaningful capital reserves   we are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation to proceed with our operations within  months we need a minimum of  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our  months financial requirement if we are successful any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the use of proceeds section of this prospectus we will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation   while we have minimal revenues as of this date no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our full plan of operations we must raise cash to implement our strategy to grow and expand per our business plan the minimum amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting the company anticipates over the next  months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately    we are highly dependent upon the success of this offering as described herein therefore the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans which would likely not even be possible for the company however if such financing were available because we are a development stage company with no operations to date we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with highrisk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities or secure a loan the company would be required to cease business operations as a result investors would lose all of their investment   additionally the company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company the company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements especially that of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  this additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement the business plan and may impede the speed of its operations      voice life inc financial statements for the period of march   inception to december

company cannot use general solicitation or advertising the company must limit its sale to “nonaccredited investors” and may not sell to nonsophisticated investors and the company has provided these investors with the necessary disclosures   note – nonemployee equity compensation plan   the company did not recognize any nonemployee stockbased compensation   related to this plan the fasb has issued asu no  compensation — stock compensation topic  accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period this asu requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered the amendments in this asu are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods the company sometime in the future will elect to adopt this asu effective and its adoption is not expected to have a material effect   under this plan the company will compute the fair value of any options granted using the blackscholes optionpricing model option forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period this estimate will be adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual option forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from the previous estimate when it is material the expected term used for options issued to nonemployees is the contractual life and the expected term used for options issued to employees is the estimated period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding the company utilizes the “simplified” method to develop an estimate of the expected term of “plain vanilla” employee option grants     note

series offering and with convertible preferred series stock will fund its operations only until december  the company intends to raise additional capital through its initial public offering “ipo” and will fund its operations only until september  though there is no assurance that it will be able to do so if the company is unable to raise additional capital the company may have to curtail its research and development efforts delay repayments of its convertible notes delay payments to vendors andor initiate cost reductions which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations these matters raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any
