know the company recently made a successful public debut here’s what interested parties need to know billy duberstein dubs apr   at pm investors interested in technology have had a nice surprise this year  initial public offerings as the trough of  moves further into memory companies such as snap and mulesoft have made their market debuts on april  another tech unicorn went public okta inc nasdaqokta the company sold  million shares at  above the projected range of   for a market cap of  billion the stock shot up to  when the market opened and today trades above   almost double the initial projected range   while im wary of buying a stock immediately after it goes public see facebook i believe investors looking for disruptive growth should become familiar with companies early in their public life as tech investments can often lead to big future gains see also facebook image source getty images what is okta okta was founded in  to help companies to secure their businesses as corporate infrastructures increasingly move toward software cloud and mobile environments oktas product is the okta identity cloud it allows organizations to secure company interactions even as they become more decentralized okta describes this phenomenon as the dissolving of the corporate firewall while moving from hardwarebased onpremises infrastructures to cloud software and mobilebased infrastructures allows companies to drive costs down and increase flexibility it also presents security risks okta solves that problem allowing companies to secure interactions with employees customers and suppliers wherever they are in a simple intuitive interface without being locked in to a single application vendor oktas identificationasaservice idaas is fully integrated with over  cloud mobile and web applications the companys founders ceo todd mckinnon and coo freddy kerrest were former salesforcecom nysecrm employees the company was also the first cloud investment by venture capital firm andreessen horowitz who are its customers oktas s filing boasts of over  customers in  countries highprofile customers include twentyfirst century fox microsofts nasdaqmsft linkedin mgm resorts and twilio okta also integrates with all the leading cloud and enterprise software vendors the company serves businesses of all sizes however okta has offices in the us canada the uk the netherlands and australia how big is its market okta believes its market is at least  billion this is far larger than its current revenue which totaled  million for the nine months ended oct   the companys growth rate for the nine months ended oct  was  is impressive and nongaap generally accepted accounting principles gross margin increased from  to  still the company remains unprofitable as its aggressively reinvesting in sales and technology net loss for the ninemonth period was  million bigger than s  million loss this is due to a doubling of research and development costs and a  increase in sales and marketing expenses in the yearoveryear period does it have competitive advantages okta touts three competitive advantages product ecosystem and data network effects for product the company believes that as it integrates with more applications and these applications are available to all users oktas platform will attain greater value for ecosystem advantages the company points to the number of system integrators and software vendors that have built ecosystems around oktas security products for data the company notes that it collects vast amounts of information about how and where users access applications and where security attacks originate okta says these proprietary insights drive future product innovation okta is the only company to be named a leader in gartners magic quadrant idaas category in all three years it has existed dollarbased retention was also strong at  for the nine months ended oct   the combination of network effects and switching costs seems powerful but im unsure exactly how resilient these advantages are business insider notes that salesforce launched a rival product called salesforce identity and that ceo marc benioff seems to have a contentious relationship with oktas founders microsoft meanwhile is both a customer and a competitor a techcrunch article asks what if microsoft develops its own solution and then pulls the ubiquitous office  from oktas platform moreover oktas s states that more large tech companies have made acquisitions in authentication and security products that being said okta was built from the ground up for the cloud and is not tied to a bundle of other offerings so it may be attractive for customers looking to avoid getting tied down to a single large vendor investor takeaway todays valuation at almost  billion is roughly  times sales thats way too expensive for me while there is no doubt that cloud computing and cybersecurity are secular growth trends im sitting on the sidelines for okta though

carecommendspositive outlookapproves of ceoi have been working at okta fulltime less than a yearpros customer support team is led by fantastic leadership that both listens and cares about what you have to say is interested in your career trajectory it was even brought up in my interview which is one of the reasons i joined the company and invests heavily in team engagement and improvement the support team is the best of the best i have the pleasure of working with some of the most motivated intelligent and engaged team members that anyone could ask for there is never a sense of working alone or unwillingness to assist from any coworker truly a great team to be in the new employees are consistently coming in better than their predecessors continuing this trend will make sure the team always is the best team to work in the work continues to grow in complexity and for those that like to continually learn and be challenged there is no better environment than okta salary and benefits are great and annual reviews to keep compensation competitive are better than any other place i have worked kitchens are now rotating stock with new food to keep things feeling fresh growth opportunities continue to expand with new roles and positions opening up on an increasing pacecons if you arent ready for a challenge this may not be the place for you the company is growing fast this leads to plenty of growing pains and problems which the company is working hard to scale at the current level some of the team members have a personal problem against management that they wont let go due to issues that have primarily passed before i joined the team when prompted about issues that could be fixed more often than not complaints that are shared are based on a personal view that doesnt consider other coworkers or the team as a whole luckily youll find that these tend to be a small minority of the group and the newer employees are both very satisfied and engaged in their roles actively working towards creating a better work environmentadvice to management you are doing a great job growing at this speed make sure that you keep a close eye on manager to employee ratio as the us team is headed towards a situation where employees may not be able to get enough oneonone time because the managers are too overloaded support team has lost some fantastic talent due to feeling slighted or unfairly treated some people see the management as unwilling to change or make things fair for all employees make sure these individual problems are addressed and that each employee feels that their concerns are understood and continue to work with them towards amicable solutions not everyone feels this way but the fact that there are some that do should be an indicator that more
