corp the company we our or gsv capital is an externally managed nondiversified closedend management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the investment company act of  as amended the  act our investment objective is to maximize our portfolios total return principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equityrelated investments we invest principally in the equity securities of what we believe to be rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies we acquire our investments through direct investments in prospective portfolio companies secondary marketplaces for private companies and negotiations with selling stockholders we may also invest on an opportunistic basis in select publicly traded equity securities or certain nonus companies that otherwise meet our investment criteria our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser gsv asset management llc gsv asset management and our administrator gsv capital service company llc gsv capital service company provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate our investment philosophy is based on a disciplined approach of identifying potentially highgrowth emerging companies across several key industry themes which may include among others social mobile cloud computing and big data internet commerce sustainability and education technology gsv asset managements investment decisions are based on a disciplined analysis of available information regarding each potential portfolio companys business operations focusing on the companys growth potential the quality of recurring revenues and cash flow and cost structures as well as an understanding of key market fundamentals venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors have invested in the vast majority of the companies that gsv asset management evaluates we seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of noncontrolling equity and equityrelated investments including common stock warrants preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio companys common equity and convertible debt securities with a significant equity component typically our preferred stock investments are nonincome producing have different voting rights than our common stock investments and are generally convertible into common stock at our discretion we seek to create a lowturnover portfolio that includes investments in companies representing a broad range of investment themes our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol gsvc the net asset value per share of our common stock on december   was  on march   the last reported sale price of a share of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market was  about gsv asset management our investment activities are managed by gsv asset management an investment adviser registered under the investment advisers act of  as amended the advisers act gsv asset management is led by michael t moe our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors mr moe is assisted by william tanona our chief financial officer treasurer and corporate secretary and mark flynn our president all of whom along with luben pampoulov partner of gsv asset management we refer to collectively as gsv asset managements senior investment professionals mr moe cofounded and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of thinkequity partners an asset management and investment banking firm focusing on venture capital entrepreneurial and emerging private companies prior to founding thinkequity mr moe served as head of global growth research at merrill lynch and before that served as head of growth research and strategy at montgomery securities we believe we benefit from the ability of gsv asset managements senior investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities conduct diligence on and value prospective investments negotiate terms and manage and monitor a portfolio of those investments gsv asset managements senior investment professionals have broad investment backgrounds with prior experience at investment banks commercial banks unregistered investment funds and other financial services companies and have collectively developed a broad network of contacts that provides us with an important source of investment opportunities      table of contents we pay gsv asset management a fee for its services under the amended and restated investment advisory agreement the investment advisory agreement which consists of two components  a base management fee and an incentive fee see  investment advisory agreement investment opportunity we believe that society is experiencing a convergence of numerous disruptive trends producing new highgrowth markets for example the growth of both social networking and connected mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has opened up new channels for communication and realtime collaboration the number of devices and people that regularly connect to the internet has increased in recent years generating significant demand for always accessible personalized and localized content and realtime online interactivity similarly the advent of education technology and insights with respect to how and what people learn are also disrupting the traditional educational sector these factors are creating opportunities for new market participants and significant growth for established companies with leading positions capitalizing on these trends at the same time we believe that the initial public offering ipo markets have experienced substantial structural changes which have made it significantly more challenging for private companies to go public volatile equity markets a lack of investment research coverage for private and smaller companies and investor demand for a longer history of revenue and earnings growth have resulted in companies staying private significantly longer than in the past in addition increased public company compliance obligations such as those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of  the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act have made it more costly and less attractive to become a public company as a result there are significantly fewer ipos today than there were during the s with prospective public companies taking longer to come to market investment strategy we seek to maintain our portfolio of potentially highgrowth emerging private companies via a repeatable and disciplined investment approach as well as to provide investors with access to such companies through our publicly traded common stock our investment objective is to maximize our portfolios total return principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equityrelated investments we have adopted the following business strategies to achieve our investment objective  identify high quality growth companies   based on our extensive experience in analyzing technology trends and markets we have identified the technology subsectors of social mobile cloud computing and big data internet commerce sustainability and education technology as opportunities where we believe companies are capable of producing substantial growth we rely on our collective industry knowledge as well as an understanding of where leading venture capitalists are investing we leverage a combination of our relationships throughout silicon valley and our independent research to identify leaders in our targeted subsectors that we believe are differentiated and best positioned for sustained growth our evaluation process is based on what we refer to as the four ps  people  organizations led by strong management teams with indepth operational focus  product  differentiated and disruptive products with leading market positioning  potential  large addressable markets  predictability  ability to forecast and drive predictable and sustainable growth      table of contents we consider these to be the core elements for identifying rapidly growing emerging companies  acquire positions in targeted investments   we seek to add to our portfolio by sourcing investments at an acceptable price through our disciplined investing strategy to this end we utilize multiple methods to acquire equity stakes in private companies that are not available to many individual investors direct equity investments   we seek direct investments in private companies there is a large market among emerging private companies for equity capital investments many of these companies particularly within the technology sector lack the necessary cash flows to sustain substantial amounts of debt and therefore have viewed equity capital as a more attractive longterm financing tool we seek to be a source of such equity capital as a means of investing in these companies and look for opportunities to invest alongside other venture capital and private equity investors with whom we have established relationships private secondary marketplaces and direct share purchases   we also utilize private secondary marketplaces as a means to acquire equity and equityrelated interests in privately held companies that meet our investment criteria and that we believe are attractive candidates for investment we believe that such markets offer new channels for access to equity investments in private companies and provide a potential source of liquidity should we decide to exit an investment in addition we also purchase shares directly from stockholders including current or former employees as certain companies grow and experience significant increased value while remaining private employees and other stockholders may seek liquidity by selling shares directly to a third party or to a third party via a secondary marketplace sales of shares in private companies are typically restricted by contractual transfer restrictions and may be further restricted by provisions in company charter documents investor rights of first refusal and cosale and company employment and trading policies which may impose strict limits on transfer we believe that the reputation of gsv asset managements investment professionals within the industry and established history of investing affords us a favorable position when seeking approval for a purchase of shares subject to such limitations  create access to a varied investment portfolio   we seek to hold a varied portfolio of noncontrolling equity investments which we believe will minimize the impact on our portfolio of a negative downturn at any one specific company we believe that our relatively varied portfolio will provide a convenient means for accredited and nonaccredited individual investors to obtain access to an asset class that has generally been limited to venture capital private equity and similar large institutional investors competitive advantages we believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages in executing our investment strategy  experienced team of investment professionals   gsv asset managements senior investment professionals and our board of directors have significant experience researching and investing in the types of potentially rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies we are targeting for investment through our proprietary companyevaluation process including our identification of technology trends and themes and company research we believe we have developed important insight into identifying and valuing emerging private companies  disciplined and repeatable investment process   we have established a disciplined and repeatable process to locate and acquire available shares at attractive valuations by utilizing multiple sources in contrast to industry aggregators that accumulate stock at market prices we conduct valuation analyses and make acquisitions only when we can invest at valuations that we believe are attractive to our investors  deep relationships with significant credibility to source and complete transactions   gsv asset management including its senior investment professionals are strategically located in the heart of silicon valley in woodside california during the course of over two decades of researching and investing in emerging private companies gsv asset managements senior investment professionals      table of contents have developed strong reputations within the investing community particularly within technologyrelated sectors gsv asset managements senior investment professionals have also developed strong relationships in the financial investing and technologyrelated sectors  source of permanent investing capital   as a publicly traded corporation we have access to a source of permanent equity capital that we can use to invest in portfolio companies this permanent equity capital is a significant differentiator from other potential investors that may be required to return capital to stockholders on a defined schedule we believe that our ability to invest on a longterm time horizon makes us attractive to companies looking for strong stable owners of their equity  early mover advantage   we believe we are one of the few publicly traded business development companies with a specific focus on investing in potentially rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies the transactions that we have executed to date since our ipo have helped to establish our reputation with the types of secondary sellers and emerging companies that we target for investment we have leveraged a number of relationships and channels to acquire the equity of private companies as we continue to grow our portfolio with attractive investments we believe that our reputation as a committed partner will be further enhanced allowing us to source and close investments that would otherwise be unavailable we believe that these factors collectively differentiate us from other potential investors in private company securities and will serve our goal to complete equity transactions in compelling private companies at attractive valuations operating and regulatory structure we were formed as a maryland corporation and as an externally managed nondiversified closedend management investment company we completed our ipo in may  and have elected to be regulated as a business development company under the  act as a business development company we are required to meet regulatory tests including the requirement to invest at least  of our gross assets in qualifying assets qualifying assets generally include among other things securities of eligible portfolio companies eligible portfolio companies generally include us companies that are not investment companies and that do not have securities listed on a national exchange if at any time less than  of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets including as a result of an increase in the value of any nonqualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional nonqualifying assets until such time as  of our thencurrent gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets we would not be required however to dispose of any nonqualifying assets in such circumstances see  regulation as a business development company we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and expect to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics see  material us federal income tax considerations and note   nature of operations and significant accounting policies  summary of significant accounting policies  us federal and state income taxes and note   income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for more information our investment activities are managed by gsv asset management and supervised by our board of directors gsv asset management is an investment adviser registered under the advisers act under the investment advisory agreement we have agreed to pay gsv asset management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance see  investment advisory agreement we have also entered into an administration agreement under which we have agreed to reimburse gsv capital service company for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred the administration agreement      table of contents investment process concentrated technologyrelated focus during the course of over two decades of researching and investing in nonpublic companies we have identified five areas from which we expect to see significant numbers of highgrowth companies emerge new media communication alternative energy education technology and the consumerization of information technology these broad markets have the potential to produce disruptive technologies reach a large addressable market and provide significant commercial opportunities within these areas we have identified broad trends that could create significant positive effects on growth such as globalization consolidation branding convergence and network effects from within these broad technology themes we have selected five subsegments in which we target companies for investment social mobile cloud computing and big data internet commerce sustainability and education technology we remain focused on selecting market leaders within the subsegments we have identified while continuing to review our pipeline to ensure we are tracking the next phase of leaders investment targeting and screening we identify prospective portfolio companies through an extensive network of relationships developed by gsv asset managements senior investment professionals supplemented by the knowledge and relationships of our board of directors investment opportunities that fall within our identified themes are validated against the observed behavior of leading venture capitalists and through our own internal and external research we evaluate potential portfolio companies across a spectrum of criteria including the four ps industry positioning and leadership stage of growth and several other factors that collectively characterize our proprietary investment process we typically seek to invest approximately  of our portfolio in wellestablished late stage companies and the remaining approximately  in emerging companies that fit within our targeted areas where we see the potential for higher returns from early investment based on our initial screening we identify a select set of companies that we evaluate in greater depth research and due diligence process once we identify those companies that we believe warrant more indepth analysis we focus on their revenue growth revenue quality and sustainability and earnings growth as well as other metrics that may be strongly correlated with higher valuations we also focus on the companys management team and any significant financial sponsor their current business model competitive positioning regulatory and legal issues the quality of any intellectual property and other investmentspecific due diligence each prospective portfolio company that passes our initial due diligence review is given a qualitative ranking to allow us to evaluate it against others in our pipeline and we review and update these companies on a regular basis our due diligence process will vary depending on whether we are investing through a private secondary transaction on a marketplace or with a selling stockholder or by direct equity investment we access information on our potential investments through a variety of sources including information made available on secondary marketplaces publications by private company research firms industry publications commissioned analysis by thirdparty research firms and to a limited extent directly from the company or financial sponsor we utilize a combination of each of these sources to help us set a target value for the companies we ultimately select for investment portfolio construction and sourcing upon completion of our research and due diligence process we select investments for inclusion in our portfolio based on their relative qualitative ranking fundamentals and valuation we seek to create a relatively varied portfolio that we expect will include investments in companies representing a broad range of investment themes we generally choose to pursue specific investments based on the availability of shares and valuation expectations we utilize a combination of secondary marketplaces direct purchases from stockholders and direct equity investments in order to make investments in our portfolio companies once we have established an initial position in a portfolio company we may choose to increase our stake through subsequent purchases maintaining a balanced portfolio is a key to our success and as a result we constantly evaluate the composition of our investments and our pipeline to ensure we are exposed to a diverse set of companies within our target segments      table of contents transaction execution we enter into purchase agreements for substantially all of our private company portfolio investments private company securities are typically subject to contractual transfer limitations which may among other things give the issuer its assignees andor its stockholders a particular period of time often  days or more in which to exercise a veto right or a right of first refusal over the sale of such securities accordingly the purchase agreements we enter into for secondary transactions typically require the lapse or satisfaction of these rights as a condition to closing under these circumstances we may be required to deposit the purchase price into escrow upon signing with the funds released to the seller at closing or returned to us if the closing conditions are not met risk management and monitoring we monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess our exposure to individual companies as well as to evaluate overall portfolio quality we establish valuation targets at the portfolio level and for gross and net exposures with respect to specific companies and industries within our overall portfolio in cases where we make a direct investment in a portfolio company we may also obtain board positions board observation rights andor information rights from that portfolio company in connection with our equity investment we regularly monitor our portfolio for compliance with the diversification requirements

in connection with the preparation of our annual and quarterly reports filed under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act or more frequently if required under the  act securities that are publicly traded are generally valued at the close price on the valuation date however if they remain subject to lockup restrictions they are discounted accordingly securities that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations including securities that trade on secondary markets for private securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors in connection with that determination members of gsv asset managements portfolio management team will prepare portfolio company valuations using when available the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts we also engage an independent valuation firm to perform independent valuations of our investments that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations we may also engage an independent valuation firm to perform independent valuations of any securities that trade on private secondary markets but are not otherwise publicly traded where there is a lack of appreciable trading or a wide disparity in recently reported trades for those securities that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations our board of directors with the assistance of its valuation committee the valuation committee will use the recommended valuations as prepared by management and the independent valuation firm respectively as a component of the foundation for its final fair value determination due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have resulted had others made the determination using the same or different procedures or had a readily available market for the securities existed and the differences could be material additionally changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the gains or losses implied by the valuation currently assigned to such investments for those investments that are publicly traded we generally record unrealized appreciation or depreciation based on changes in the market value of the securities as of the valuation date publicly traded securities that remain subject to lockup restrictions are discounted accordingly for those investments that are not publicly traded and for which there are no readily available market quotations we record unrealized depreciation on such investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired and record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and our equity security has also appreciated in value changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we generally determine the fair value of our investments by considering a number of factors the following represent factors that among others could impact our fair value determinations  public trading of our portfolio securities taking into consideration lockup requirements and liquidity  active trading of our portfolio securities on a private secondary market where we have determined that there is meaningful volume and the transactions are considered arms length by sophisticated investors      table of contents  qualified funding rounds in the companies in which we are invested where there is meaningful and reputable information available on size valuation and investors and  additional investments by us in current portfolio companies where the price of the new investment differs materially from prior investments there is inherent subjectivity in determining the fair value of our investments in addition we will accrue as a liability each time we calculate net asset value the amount we may owe gsv asset management for the income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee the latter of which is based on the amount of unrealized and realized capital appreciation we expect that most of our portfolio investments other than those for which market quotations are readily available and that may be sold without restriction will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors with the assistance of our valuation committee furthermore when calculating net asset value we also consider our recognition of a deferred tax liability for unrealized gains on investments for those investments held in our taxable subsidiaries refer to note   nature of operations and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for a list of our taxable subsidiaries investment advisory agreement management services gsv asset management serves as our investment adviser gsv asset management is registered as an investment adviser under the advisers act subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors gsv asset management manages our daytoday operations and provides us with investment advisory services under the terms of the investment advisory agreement gsv asset management  determines the composition of our portfolio the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes  determines what securities we will purchase retain or sell  performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies  identifies evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make  closes monitors and services the investments we make and  provides us with such other investment advisory research and related services as we from time to time reasonably require for the investment of our funds gsv asset managements services under the investment advisory agreement are not exclusive and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired for example as of march   gsv asset management also manages courseragsv fund lp and courseragsvedbi fund lp special purpose vehicles each comprised of an underlying investment in coursera stock collectively the coursera funds and serves as subadviser for certain investment series of gsv ventures i llc gsv ventures ii llc gsv ventures iii llc gsv ventures iv llc gsv ventures v llc and gsv ventures vi llc each a venture capital and growth equity fund collectively the gsv ventures funds and will likely manage one or more private funds or series within such private funds in the future we have no ownership interests in the coursera funds or the gsv ventures funds subadvised by gsv asset management while the investment focus of each of these entities including the coursera funds and the gsv ventures funds may be different from our investment objective it is likely that new investment opportunities that meet our investment objective will come to the attention of one of these entities or new entities that will likely be formed in the future in connection with another investment advisory client or program and if so such opportunity might not be offered or otherwise made available to us however our executive officers directors and investment adviser gsv asset management intend to treat us in a fair and equitable manner consistent with their applicable duties under law so that we will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other particular client in addition while gsv asset management anticipates that it will from time to time identify investment opportunities that are appropriate for both us and the other funds that are currently or in the future may be managed by gsv asset management to the extent it does identify such opportunities gsv asset      table of contents management has established an allocation policy to ensure that we have priority over such other funds our chief compliance officer as well as our board of directors will monitor on a quarterly basis any such allocation of investment opportunities between us and any such other funds management fees we pay gsv asset management a fee for its services under the investment advisory agreement consisting of two components  a base management fee and an incentive fee the cost of both the base management fee payable to gsv asset management and any incentive fees earned by gsv asset management are ultimately borne by our common stockholders in aggregate we paid gsv asset management  under the investment advisory agreement during the fiscal years ended december    and  under the terms of the investment advisory agreement the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of  of our gross assets which is our total assets as reflected on our balance sheet with no deduction for liabilities effective january   through december   however pursuant to a voluntary waiver by gsv asset management we will pay gsv asset management a base management fee of  a  reduction from the  base management fee payable under the investment advisory agreement this waiver of a portion of the base management fee is not subject to recourse against or reimbursement by us for the years ended december    and  the base management fee has been payable monthly in arrears and was calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter incentive fees the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement as of the termination date and is equal to the lesser of   of our realized capital gains during such calendar year if any calculated on an investmentbyinvestment basis subject to a noncompounded preferred return or hurdle and a catchup feature and   of our realized capital gains if any on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees our realized capital gains from each investment expressed as a noncompounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it will be compared to a hurdle rate of  per year we will only pay an incentive fee on any realized capital gains from an investment that exceeds the hurdle rate we will pay gsv asset management an incentive fee with respect to our realized capital gains from each investment as follows  no incentive fee is payable on the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that when expressed as a noncompounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it does not exceed the hurdle rate of  per year  we pay as an incentive fee  of the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that when expressed as a noncompounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it exceeds the hurdle rate of  per year but is less than a rate of  per year we refer to this portion of our realized capital gains from each investment which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than  as the catchup the catchup is meant to provide gsv asset management with  of the amount of our realized capital gains from an investment that when expressed as a noncompounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it exceeds a rate of  per year  we pay as an incentive fee  of the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that when expressed as a noncompounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it exceeds a rate of  per year      table of contents in no event however will we pay an incentive fee for any calendar year that exceeds  of our realized capital gains if any on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  relatedparty transactions for details of incentive fees paid and accrued the following is a graphical representation of the calculation of our incentive fee with respect to a single investment click to enlarge for accounting purposes in order to reflect the theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon realized capital gains and losses during the current calendar year through the end of the period plus any unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation as of the end of the period it should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the investment advisory agreement and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods amounts paid under the investment advisory agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the investment advisory agreement we seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of noncontrolling investments in our portfolio companies although we primarily invest through private secondary markets to the extent we make a direct minority investment in a portfolio company neither we nor our investment adviser gsv asset management may have the ability to control the timing of when we realize capital gains or losses with respect to such investment we expect the timing of such realization events to be determined by our portfolio companies in such cases to the extent we have nonminority investments or the securities we hold are traded on a private secondary market or public securities exchange gsv asset management will have greater control over the timing of a realization event in such cases our board of directors will monitor such investments in connection with their general oversight of the investment management services provided by gsv asset management in addition as of the end of each fiscal quarter we will evaluate whether the cumulative aggregate unrealized appreciation on our portfolio would be sufficient to require us to pay an incentive fee to gsv asset management if such unrealized appreciation were actually realized as of the end of such quarter and if so we will accrue an expense equal to the amount of such incentive fee any such accrual of incentive fees will be reflected in the calculation of our net asset value payment of our expenses our primary operating expenses are the payment of a base management fee and any incentive fees under the investment advisory agreement and the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by gsv capital service company in performing its obligations under the administration agreement our base management fee compensates gsv asset management for its work in identifying evaluating negotiating executing and servicing our investments we bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions including without limitation fees and expenses relating to expenses of offering our debt and equity securities the investigation and monitoring of our investments including expenses and travel fees incurred in

cash cash equivalents us government securities or highquality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment which we refer to collectively as temporary investments so that  of our assets are qualifying assets typically we will invest in us treasury bills or in repurchase agreements provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the us government or its agencies a repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor such as us of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreedupon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreedupon interest rate there is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements however if more than  of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty we would not meet the diversification tests in

federal income tax laws including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax taxexempt organizations insurance companies dealers in securities traders in securities that elect to use a marktomarket method of accounting for their securities holdings pension plans and trusts and financial institutions this summary is limited to beneficial owners of our common stock that will hold such common stock as capital assets within the meaning of the code the discussion is based upon the code treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations each as of the date of this annual report on form k and all of which are subject to change possibly retroactively which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion this summary does not discuss any aspects of us estate or gift tax or foreign state or local tax it does not discuss the special treatment under us federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in taxexempt securities or certain other investment assets tax matters are complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our common stock will depend on the facts of his her or its particular situation we encourage investors to consult their own tax advisers regarding the specific consequences of such an investment including tax reporting requirements the applicability of federal state local and foreign tax laws eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws if a partnership including an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds the shares of our common stock the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level investors treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or investors that are partners in such a partnership are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisers with respect to the tax consequences relating to the acquisition ownership and disposition of our common stock a us stockholder generally is a beneficial owner of common stock who is for us federal income tax purposes  a citizen or individual resident of the united states  a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia and an entity organized outside of the united states that is treated as a us corporation under specialized sections of the code      table of contents  a trust if a court within the united states has primary supervision over its administration and one or more us persons have the authority to control all of its substantive decisions or if the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable us treasury regulations to be treated as a us person or  an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source as used herein the term nonus stockholder means a beneficial owner of common stock that is not a us stockholder or a partnership for us federal income tax purposes a nonus stockholder does not include an individual present in the united states for  days or more in the taxable year of disposition of the common stock such a stockholder is encouraged to consult his or her own tax adviser regarding us federal income tax consequences of the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of the common stock election to be taxed as a ric we elected to be treated as a ric under the code beginning with our taxable year ended december   have qualified to be treated as a ric for the subsequent taxable years and expect to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics included in our consolidated financial statements the following whollyowned subsidiaries are taxable subsidiaries collectively the gsvc holdings regardless of whether we are a ric gsvc ae holdings inc gsvc av holdings inc gsvc ng holdings inc gsvc sw holdings inc gsvc ws holdings inc and gsvc svds holdings inc these taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expenses as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies such income tax expenses and deferred taxes if any will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended  however we failed to satisfy certain tests required for us to qualify as a ric under the code and were therefore subject to corporatelevel us federal income tax in september  we filed our  tax return as a ric and sought to be granted ric status for our  taxable year however we determined we would not be eligible to elect to be treated as a ric for the  taxable year unless we were certified by the sec as principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions technological improvements new processes or products not previously generally available for the  taxable year such certification an sec certification in september  we had not received such sec certification for our  taxable year and we determined it was in the best interests of our stockholders to file the  tax return as a c corporation as of march  we had not received and do not anticipate receiving such sec certification for our  taxable year we do not intend to pursue this certification with the sec so long as we qualify and maintain our status as a ric we generally will not pay corporatelevel us federal and state income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends rather any tax liability related to income earned by us as a ric will represent obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements to qualify as a ric we must among other things meet certain sourceofincome and asset diversification requirements as described below in addition in order to qualify for the special treatment accorded to rics we are required to distribute to our stockholders on a timely basis each year at least  of investment company taxable income which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net shortterm capital gains over realized net longterm capital losses the annual distribution requirement and to meet certain asset diversification requirements on a quarterly basis we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are morelikelythannot to be sustained by the applicable tax authority we recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position has met the morelikelythannot threshold we classify penalties and interest associated with income taxes if any as income tax expense conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including but not limited to ongoing analyses of tax laws regulations and interpretations thereof we have identified our major tax jurisdictions as us federal and california      table of contents taxation as a regulated investment company if we  qualify as a ric and  satisfy the annual distribution requirement then the following rules will apply to us we will not be subject to us federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute or are deemed to distribute to stockholders we will be subject to us federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income including capital gains not distributed or deemed distributed to our stockholders we will be subject to a  nondeductible us federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of   of our net ordinary income for each calendar year   of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the oneyear period ending october  in that calendar year and  any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such preceding years the excise tax avoidance requirement we generally will endeavor in each year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any us federal excise tax on our earnings in order to qualify as a ric for us federal income tax purposes we must among other things  have in effect an election to be regulated as a business development company under the  act at all times during each taxable year  derive in each taxable year at least  of our gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to loans of certain securities gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities the  income test and  diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year  at least  of the value of our assets consists of cash cash equivalents us government securities securities of other rics and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than  of the value of our assets or more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer the  diversification test and  no more than  of the value of our assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other rics of one issuer of two or more issuers that are controlled as determined under applicable code rules by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain qualified publicly traded partnerships the  diversification test and together with the  diversification test the diversification tests provided that we satisfy the diversification tests as of the close of any quarter we will not fail the diversification tests as of the close of a subsequent quarter as a consequence of a discrepancy between the value of our assets and the requirements of the diversification tests that is attributable solely to fluctuations in the value of our assets rather we will fail the diversification tests as of the end of a subsequent quarter only if such a discrepancy existed immediately after our acquisition of any asset and such discrepancy is wholly or partly the result of that acquisition in addition if we fail the diversification tests as of the end of any quarter we will not lose our status as a ric if we eliminate the discrepancy within thirty days of the end of such quarter and if we eliminate the discrepancy within that thirtyday period we will be treated as having satisfied the diversification tests as of the end of such quarter for purposes of applying the rule described in the preceding sentence assuming that it is not the first quarter of ric qualification an alternative  diversification test applies to certain rics that obtain sec certification for the applicable taxable year such sec certification may not be received earlier than  days prior to the close of the taxable year to which it applies if a ric has received this certification then for purposes of the  diversification test securities of an issuer will be treated as good investments as long as the rics basis in the securities of such issuer did not exceed  of the rics total assets when acquired whether or not the      table of contents ric owns more than  of the voting securities of such issuer this alternative test does not apply to the securities of any issuer if the ric has continuously held securities of the issuer for  or more years preceding the applicable quarter end the  diversification test is not affected by this alternative  diversification test as a result of converting from a c corporation to a ric we are required to pay a corporatelevel us federal income tax on the net amount of the net builtin gains if any in our assets ie the amount by which the net fair market value of our assets exceeds our net adjusted basis in our assets as of the date of conversion ie january   to the extent that such gains are recognized by us during the applicable recognition period which is the fiveyear period beginning on the date of conversion any corporatelevel builtin gain tax is payable at the time the builtin gains are recognized which generally will be the years in which the builtin gain assets are sold in a taxable transaction the amount of this tax will vary depending on the assets that are actually sold by us in the applicable period the amount of realized gain loss the actual amount of net builtin gain or loss present in those assets as of the date of conversion and the effective tax rates at such times the payment of any such corporatelevel us federal income tax on builtin gain will be an expense that will reduce the amount available for distribution to our stockholders the builtin gain tax is calculated by determining a rics net unrealized builtin gains if any by which the fair market value of the assets of the ric at the beginning of the first ricyear exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of such assets at that time we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash for example if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the origination of a loan or possibly in other circumstances we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year we may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash such as contractual paymentinkind or pik interest which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term or dividends and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in noncash compensation such as warrants or stock because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount we will be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the  act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could under certain circumstances restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the annual distribution requirement see  regulation as a business development company  senior securities moreover our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by  the illiquid nature of our portfolio andor  other requirements relating to our status as a ric including the diversification tests if we dispose of assets in order to meet the annual distribution requirement or the excise tax avoidance requirement we may make such dispositions at times that from an investment standpoint are not advantageous certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex us federal income tax provisions that may among other things i disallow suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions ii convert lower taxed longterm capital gain into higher taxed shortterm capital gain or ordinary income iii convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss the deductibility of which is more limited iv cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash v adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur vi adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and vii produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the  income test described above we will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss the treatment of such gain or loss as longterm or shortterm will depend on how long we held a particular warrant upon the      table of contents exercise of a warrant acquired by us our tax basis in the stock purchased under the warrant will equal the sum of the amount paid for the warrant plus the strike price paid on the exercise of the warrant failure to maintain our qualification as a ric if we fail to satisfy the  income test or the diversification tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a ric for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable which may among other things require us to pay certain corporatelevel us federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets if we were unable to qualify for treatment as a ric and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders distributions would not be required and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that subject to certain limitations may be eligible for the  maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements were met subject to certain limitations under the code corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholders tax basis and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain to requalify as a ric in a subsequent taxable year we would be required to satisfy the ric qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a ric subject to a limited exception applicable to rics that qualified as such under subchapter m of the code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a ric no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net builtin gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a ric that are recognized within the subsequent  years unless we made a special election to pay corporatelevel us federal income tax on such builtin gain at the time of our requalification as a ric      table of contents item a risk factors investing in our securities involves a number of significant risks in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k you should consider carefully the following information before making an investment in our securities although the risks described below represent the principal risks associated with an investment in us they are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us might also impair our operations and performance if any of the following events occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in such case our net asset value and the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our investments our investments in the rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies that we are targeting may be extremely risky and we could lose all or part of our investments investment in the rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies that we are targeting involves a number of significant risks including the following  these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their existing debt which may lead to equity financings possibly at discounted valuations in which we could be substantially diluted if we do not or cannot participate bankruptcy or liquidation and the reduction or loss of our equity investment  they typically have limited operating histories narrower less established product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions market conditions and consumer sentiment in respect of their products or services as well as general economic downturns  they generally have less predictable operating results may from time to time be parties to litigation may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations finance expansion or maintain their competitive position  because they are privately owned there is generally little publicly available information about these businesses therefore although gsv asset managements agents will perform due diligence investigations on these portfolio companies their operations and their prospects we may not learn all of the material information we need to know regarding these businesses and in the case of investments we acquire on private secondary transactions we may be unable to obtain financial or other information regarding the companies with respect to which we invest furthermore there can be no assurance that the information that we do obtain with respect to any investment is reliable and  they are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons therefore the death disability resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the portfolio company and in turn on us a portfolio companys failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by its lenders could lead to defaults and potentially termination of its loans and foreclosure on its assets which could trigger crossdefaults under other agreements and jeopardize our equity investment in such portfolio company we may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery of our equity investment or to negotiate new terms with a financially distressed portfolio company because our investments are generally not in publicly traded securities there will be uncertainty regarding the value of our investments which could adversely affect the determination of our net asset value our portfolio investments will generally not be in publicly traded securities as a result although we expect that some of our equity investments may trade on private secondary marketplaces the fair value of our direct investments in portfolio companies will often not be readily determinable under the  act for our      table of contents investments for which there are no readily available market quotations including securities that while listed on a private securities exchange have not actively traded we will value such securities at fair value quarterly as determined in good faith by our board of directors based upon the recommendation of the valuation committee in accordance with our written valuation policy in connection with that determination members of gsv asset managements portfolio management team will prepare portfolio company valuations using where available the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts the valuation committee utilizes the services of an independent valuation firm which prepares valuations for each of our portfolio investments that are not publicly traded or for which we do not have readily available market quotations including securities that while listed on a private securities exchange have not actively traded however the board of directors retains ultimate authority as to the appropriate valuation of each such investment the types of factors that the valuation committee takes into account in providing its fair value recommendation to the board of directors with respect to such nontraded investments include as relevant and to the extent available the portfolio companys earnings the markets in which the portfolio company does business comparison to valuations of publicly traded companies comparisons to recent sales of comparable companies the discounted value of the cash flows of the portfolio company and other relevant factors this information may not be available because it is difficult to obtain financial and other information with respect to private companies and even when we are able to obtain such information there can be no assurance that it is complete or accurate because such valuations are inherently uncertain and may be based on estimates our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would be assessed if a readily available market for these securities existed due to this uncertainty our fair value determinations with respect to any nontraded investments we hold may cause our net asset value on a given date to materially understate or overstate the value that we may ultimately realize on one or more of our investments as a result investors purchasing our securities based on an overstated net asset value would pay a higher price than the value of our investments might warrant conversely investors selling securities during a period in which the net asset value understates the value of our investments would receive a lower price for their securities than the value of our investments might warrant we may not realize gains from our equity investments and because certain of our portfolio companies may incur substantial debt to finance their operations we may experience a complete loss on our equity investment in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation of any of our portfolio companies we invest principally in the equity and equityrelated securities of what we believe to be rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies however the equity interests we acquire may not appreciate in value and in fact may decline in value in addition the private company securities we acquire are often subject to dragalong rights which could permit other stockholders under certain circumstances to force us to liquidate our position in a subject company at a specified price which could be in our opinion inadequate or undesirable or even below our cost basis in this event we could realize a loss or fail to realize gain in an amount that we deem appropriate on our investment further capital market volatility and the overall market environment may preclude our portfolio companies from realizing liquidity events and impede our exit from these investments accordingly we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience we will generally have little if any control over the timing of any gains we may realize from our equity investments unless and until the portfolio companies in which we invest become publicly traded in addition the companies in which we invest may have substantial debt loads in such cases we would typically be last in line behind any creditors in a bankruptcy or liquidation and would likely experience a complete loss on our investment      table of contents most of our portfolio companies are currently experiencing operating losses which may be substantial and there can be no assurance when or if such companies will operate at a profit we have limited information about the financial performance and profitability of some of our portfolio companies while according to public filings with the sec certain of our portfolio companies have earned net income in recent periods we believe that many of our portfolio companies are currently experiencing operating losses there can be no assurance when or if such companies will operate at a profit the lack of liquidity in and potentially extended holding period of our many investments may adversely affect our business and will delay any distributions of gains if any our investments will generally not be in publicly traded securities although we expect that some of our equity investments will trade on private secondary marketplaces certain of the securities we hold will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities in addition while some portfolio companies may trade on private secondary marketplaces we can provide no assurance that such a trading market will continue or remain active or that we will be able to sell our position in any portfolio company at the time we desire to do so and at the price we anticipate the illiquidity of our investments including those that are traded on private secondary marketplaces will make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises also if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments we have no limitation on the portion of our portfolio that may be invested in illiquid securities and a substantial portion or all of our portfolio may be invested in such illiquid securities from time to time in addition because we generally invest in equity and equityrelated securities with respect to the majority of our portfolio companies we do not expect regular realization events if any to occur in the near term we expect that our holdings of equity securities may require several years to appreciate in value and we can offer no assurance that such appreciation will occur even if such appreciation does occur it is likely that initial purchasers of our shares could wait for an extended period of time before any appreciation or sale of our investments and any attendant distributions of gains may be realized our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies or market sectors which subjects us to a risk of significant loss if the business or market position of these companies deteriorates or market sectors experiences a market downturn a consequence of our limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment for example as of december    of our net asset value was comprised of investments in  portfolio companies beyond the asset diversification requirements necessary to qualify as a ric we have general guidelines for diversification however our investments could be concentrated in relatively few issuers in addition our investments may be concentrated in a limited number of market sectors including in technologyrelated sectors as a result a downturn in any market sector in which a significant number of our portfolio companies operate or the deterioration of the market position of any portfolio company in which we have a material position could materially adversely affect us      table of contents our financial results could be negatively affected if a significant portfolio investment fails to perform as expected our total investment in companies may be significant individually or in the aggregate as a result if a significant investment in one or more companies fails to perform as expected our financial results could be more negatively affected and the magnitude of the loss could be more significant than if we had made smaller investments in more companies the

many risks including volatility intense competition decreasing life cycles product obsolescence changing consumer preferences and periodic downturns given the experience of gsv asset managements senior investment professionals within the technology space we expect that a number of the companies with respect to which we invest will operate in technologyrelated sectors the revenues income or losses and valuations of technologyrelated companies can and often do fluctuate suddenly and dramatically in addition because of rapid technological change the average selling prices of products and some services provided by technologyrelated sectors have historically decreased over their productive lives as a result the average selling prices of products and services offered by our portfolio companies that operate in technologyrelated sectors may decrease over time which could adversely affect their operating results and correspondingly the value of any equity securities that we may hold this could in turn materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we may be limited in our ability to make followon investments and our failure to make followon investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio following an initial investment in a portfolio company we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as followon investments in order to  increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage  exercise warrants options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing or  attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment we may elect not to make followon investments or may otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments or lack access to desired followon investment opportunities we have the discretion to make any followon investments subject to the availability of capital resources and of the investment opportunity the failure to make followon investments may in some circumstances jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired followon investment we may elect not to make a followon investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk because we prefer other opportunities or because we are inhibited by compliance with business development company requirements or the desire to qualify to maintain our status as a ric or we lack access to the desired followon investment opportunity      table of contents in addition we may be unable to complete followon investments in our portfolio companies that have conducted an ipo as a result of regulatory or financial restrictions because we will generally not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies we will likely not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by substantial stockholders or management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments generally we will not take controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies as a result we will be subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree and the stockholders and management of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests in addition other stockholders such as venture capital and private equity sponsors that have substantial investments in our portfolio companies may have interests that differ from that of the portfolio company or its minority stockholders which may lead them to take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our investment in the portfolio company due to the lack of liquidity for the equity and equityrelated investments that we will typically hold in our portfolio companies we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company or its substantial stockholders and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments investments in foreign companies may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in us investments while we invest primarily in us companies we may invest on an opportunistic basis in certain nonus companies including those located in emerging markets that otherwise meet our investment criteria in regards to the regulatory requirements for business development companies some of these investments may not qualify as investments in eligible portfolio companies and thus may not be considered qualifying assets eligible portfolio companies generally include us companies that are not investment companies and that do not have securities listed on a national exchange if at any time less than  of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets including as a result of an increase in the value of any nonqualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional nonqualifying assets until such time as  of our thencurrent gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets we would not be required however to dispose of any nonqualifying assets in such circumstances in addition investing in foreign companies and particularly those in emerging markets may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in us issues these risks include changes in exchange control regulations political and social instability expropriation imposition of foreign taxes less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the united states higher transaction costs less government supervision of exchanges brokers and issuers less developed bankruptcy laws difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility further we may have difficulty enforcing our rights as equity holders in foreign jurisdictions in addition to the extent we invest in nonus companies we may face greater exposure to foreign economic developments although we expect that most of our investments will be us dollardenominated any investments denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances the level of shortterm interest rates differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies longterm opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments we may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions if we engage in hedging transactions we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions we may utilize instruments such as forward contracts currency options and interest rate swaps caps collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline however such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions such      table of contents hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price moreover for a variety of reasons we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss in addition it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in nonus currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations risks related to our business and structure any failure on our part to maintain our status as a business development company would reduce our operating flexibility the  act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of business development companies for example business development companies are required to invest at least  of their gross assets in specified types of securities primarily in private companies or thinlytraded us public companies cash cash equivalents us government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less furthermore any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on business development companies by the  act could cause the sec to bring an enforcement action against us andor expose us to claims of private litigants in addition upon approval of a majority of our stockholders we may elect to withdraw our status as a business development company if we decide to withdraw our election or if we otherwise fail to maintain our qualification to be regulated as a business development company we may be subject to substantially greater regulation under the  act as a closedend investment company compliance with such regulations would significantly decrease our operating flexibility and could significantly increase our costs of doing business we are dependent upon gsv asset managements senior investment professionals for our future success if we lose any of gsv asset managements senior investment professionals our ability to implement our business strategy could be significantly harmed we depend on the diligence skill and network of business contacts of the gsv asset managements senior investment professionals these senior investment professionals together with other investment professionals employed by gsv asset management evaluate negotiate structure close monitor and service our investments our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of gsv asset managements senior investment professionals particularly michael t moe mark w flynn william tanona and luben pampoulov all of gsv asset managements senior investment professionals including michael t moe mark w flynn william tanona and luben pampoulov are atwill employees as a result although messrs moe flynn tanona and pampoulov comprise the principals of gsv asset management they are free to terminate their employment with gsv asset management at any time in addition none of gsv asset managements senior investment professionals including messrs moe flynn tanona and pampoulov are subject to any noncompete agreements that would restrict their ability to provide investment advisory services to an entity with an investment objective similar to our own in the event they were to terminate their employment with gsv asset management or if gsv asset management were to no longer serve as our investment adviser there can be no assurance that gsv asset management will be successful in retaining its senior investment professionals including messrs moe flynn tanona and pampoulov the departure of any of messrs moe flynn tanona and pampoulov could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective our growth will require that gsv asset management retain and attract new investment and administrative personnel in a competitive market its ability to attract and retain personnel with the requisite credentials experience and skills will depend on several factors including but not limited to its ability to offer competitive wages benefits and professional growth opportunities many of the entities with which gsv asset management will compete for experienced personnel including investment funds such as private equity funds and mezzanine funds and traditional financial services companies will have greater resources than it does      table of contents our financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to achieve our investment objective our ability to achieve our investment objective will depend on gsv asset managements ability to identify analyze and invest in companies that meet our investment criteria accomplishing this result on a costeffective basis is largely a function of gsv asset managements structuring of the investment process and its ability to provide competent attentive and efficient services to us we seek a specified number of investments in rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies which may be extremely risky there can be no assurance that gsv asset management will be successful in identifying and investing in companies that meet our investment criteria or that we will achieve our investment objective in addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments gsv asset management is required to offer and may be called upon to provide managerial assistance to some of our portfolio companies for example as of march   gsv asset management also manages the coursera funds and serves as subadviser for certain investment series of the gsv ventures funds and will likely manage one or more private funds or series within such private funds in the future we have no ownership interests in the coursera funds or the gsv ventures funds subadvised by gsv asset management these demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment even if we are able to grow and build upon our investment operations any failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the results of our operations will depend on many factors including the availability of opportunities for investment readily accessible short and longterm funding alternatives in the financial markets and economic conditions furthermore any inability to successfully operate our business or implement our investment policies and strategies as described herein could adversely impact our ability to pay dividends we will likely experience fluctuations in our quarterly results and we may be unable to replicate past investment opportunities or make the types of investments we have made to date in future periods we will likely experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors including the rate at which we make new investments the level of our expenses changes in the valuation of our portfolio investments variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions for example since inception through december   we have experienced substantial cumulative negative cash flows from operations these fluctuations may in certain cases be exaggerated as a result of our focus on realizing capital gains rather than current income from our investments in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate or acquire investments that are of a similar nature to those currently in our portfolio as a result of these factors results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods our business model depends upon the development and maintenance of strong referral relationships with private equity venture capital funds and investment banking firms we are substantially dependent on our informal relationships which we use to help identify and gain access to investment opportunities if we fail to maintain our relationships with key firms or if we fail to establish strong referral relationships with other firms or other sources of investment opportunities we will not be able to grow our portfolio of equity investments and achieve our investment objective in addition persons with whom we have informal relationships are not obligated to inform us of investment opportunities and therefore such relationships may not lead to the origination of equity or other investments any loss or diminishment of such relationships could effectively reduce our ability to identify attractive portfolio companies that meet our investment criteria either for direct equity investments or for investments through private secondary market transactions or other secondary transactions      table of contents there are significant potential risks relating to investing in securities traded on private secondary marketplaces we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize private secondary marketplaces such as sharespost inc and the nasdaq private market llc to acquire investments for our portfolio when we purchase secondary shares we may have little or no direct access to financial or other information from these portfolio companies as a result we are dependent upon the relationships and contacts of gsv asset managements senior investment professionals and our board of directors to obtain the information for gsv asset management to perform research and due diligence and to monitor our investments after they are made there can be no assurance that gsv asset management will be able to acquire adequate information on which to make its investment decision with respect to any private secondary marketplace purchases or that the information it is able to obtain is accurate or complete any failure to obtain full and complete information regarding the portfolio companies with respect to which we invest through private secondary marketplaces could cause us to lose part or all of our investment in such companies which would have a material and adverse effect on our net asset value and results of operations in addition while we believe the ability to trade on private secondary marketplaces provides valuable opportunities for liquidity there can be no assurance that the portfolio companies with respect to which we invest through private secondary marketplaces will have or maintain active trading markets and the prices of those securities may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods which may result in an inability for us to realize full value on our investment in addition wide swings in market prices which are typical of irregularly traded securities could cause significant and unexpected declines in the value of our portfolio investments further prices in private secondary marketplaces where limited information is available may not accurately reflect the true value of a portfolio company and may overstate a portfolio companys actual value which may cause us to realize future capital losses on our investment in that portfolio company if any of the foregoing were to occur it would likely have a material and adverse effect on our net asset value and results of operations investments in private companies including through private secondary marketplaces also entail additional legal and regulatory risks which expose participants to the risk of liability due to the imbalance of information among participants and participant qualification and other transactional requirements applicable to private securities transactions the noncompliance with which could result in rescission rights and monetary and other sanctions the application of these laws within the context of private secondary marketplaces and related market practices are still evolving and despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws we could be exposed to liability the regulation of private secondary marketplaces is also evolving additional state or federal regulation of these markets could result in limits on the operation of or activity on those markets conversely deregulation of these markets could make it easier for investors to invest directly in private companies and affect the attractiveness of our company as an access vehicle for investment in private shares private companies may also increasingly seek to limit secondary trading in their stock such as through contractual transfer restrictions and provisions in company charter documents investor rights of first refusal and cosale andor employment and trading policies further restricting trading to the extent that these or other developments result in reduced trading activity andor availability of private company shares our ability to find investment opportunities and to liquidate our investments could be adversely affected due to transfer restrictions and the illiquid nature of our investments we may not be able to purchase or sell our investments when we wish to do so most of our investments are or will be in equity or equityrelated securities of privately held companies the securities we acquire in private companies are typically subject to contractual transfer limitations which may include prohibitions on transfer without the companys consent may require that shares owned by us be held in escrow and may include provisions in company charter documents and may include investor rights of first refusal and cosale andor employment or trading policies further restricting trading in order to complete a purchase of shares we may need to among other things give the issuer its assignees or its stockholders a particular period of time often  days or more in which to exercise a veto right or a right of first refusal over the sale of such securities we may be unable to complete a purchase transaction if the subject company or its stockholders chooses to exercise a veto right or right of first refusal when we complete an investment we generally become bound to the contractual transfer limitations imposed on the subject companys      table of contents stockholders as well as other contractual obligations such as cosale or tagalong rights these obligations generally expire only upon an ipo by the subject company as a result prior to an ipo our ability to liquidate may be constrained transfer restrictions could limit our ability to liquidate our positions in these securities if we are unable to find buyers acceptable to our portfolio companies or where applicable their stockholders such buyers may not be willing to purchase our investments at adequate prices or in volumes sufficient to liquidate our position and even where they are willing other stockholders could exercise their cosales or tagalong rights to participate in the sale thereby reducing the number of shares sellable by us furthermore prospective buyers may be deterred from entering into purchase transactions with us due to the delay and uncertainty that these transfer and other limitations create although we believe that secondary marketplaces may offer an opportunity to liquidate our private company investments there can be no assurance that a trading market will develop for the securities that we wish to liquidate or that the subject companies will permit their shares to be sold through such marketplaces even if some of our portfolio companies complete ipos we are typically subject to lockup provisions that prohibit us from selling our investments into the public market for specified periods of time after ipos as a result the market price of securities that we hold may decline substantially before we are able to sell these securities following an ipo due to the illiquid nature of most of our investments we may not be able to sell these securities at times when we deem it advantageous to do so or at all because our net asset value is only determined on a quarterly basis and due to the difficulty in assessing this value our net asset value may not fully reflect the illiquidity of our portfolio which may change on a daily basis depending on many factors including the status of the private secondary markets and our particular portfolio at any given time there are significant potential risks associated with investing in venture capital companies with complex capital structures we invest primarily in what we believe to be rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies either through private secondary transactions other secondary transactions or direct investments in companies such private companies frequently have much more complex capital structures than traditional publicly traded companies and may have multiple classes of equity securities with differing rights including with respect to voting and distributions in addition it is often difficult to obtain financial and other information with respect to private companies and even where we are able to obtain such information there can be no assurance that it is complete or accurate in certain cases such private companies may also have senior or pari passu preferred stock or senior debt outstanding which may heighten the risk of investing in the underlying equity of such private companies particularly in circumstances when we have limited information with respect to such capital structures although we believe that gsv asset managements senior investment professionals and our board of directors have extensive experience evaluating and investing in private companies with such complex capital structures there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately evaluate the relative risks and benefits of investing in a particular class of a portfolio companys equity securities any failure on our part to properly evaluate the relative rights and value of a class of securities in which we invest could cause us to lose part or all of our investment which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our net asset value and results of operations our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance public disclosure and accounting requirements that are costly and could adversely affect our business and financial results we are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and the nasdaq stock market have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by congress in addition there are significant corporate governance and executive compensationrelated provisions in the doddfrank act and the sec has adopted and may continue to adopt additional rules and regulations that may impact us our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in an increase in expenses and a diversion of managements time from other business activities      table of contents in addition any failure to keep pace with such rules or for our management to appropriately address compliance with such rules fully and in a timely manner would expose us to an increasing risk of inadvertent noncompliance while our management team takes reasonable efforts to ensure that we are in full compliance with all laws applicable to our operations the increasing rate and extent of regulatory change increases the risk of a failure to comply which may limit our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course or may subject us to potential fines regulatory findings or other matters that may materially impact our business over the last several years there has also been an increase in regulatory attention to the extension of credit outside of the traditional banking sector raising the possibility that some portion of the nonbank financial sector will be subject to new regulation while it cannot be known at this time whether any regulation will be implemented or what form it will take increased regulation of nonbank credit extension could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition impose additional costs on us intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability and we cannot predict when these conditions will occur such market conditions could materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the united states and abroad which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations as a business development company we must maintain our ability to raise additional capital for investment purposes without sufficient access to the capital markets or credit markets we may be forced to curtail our business operations or we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities from time to time capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability for example between  and  the global capital markets were unstable as evidenced by periodic disruptions in liquidity in the debt capital markets significant writeoffs in the financial services sector the repricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major financial institutions despite actions of the us federal government and foreign governments these events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular while market conditions have largely recovered from the events of  and  there have been continuing periods of volatility some lasting longer than others for example the referendum by british voters to exit the european union eu brexit in june  has led to further disruption and instability in the global markets there can be no assurance these market conditions will not repeat themselves or worsen in the future equity capital may be difficult to raise during periods of adverse or volatile market conditions because subject to some limited exceptions as a business development company we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than net asset value without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can also create a challenging environment in which to raise or access debt capital the reappearance of market conditions similar to those experienced from  through  for any substantial length of time could make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business the debt capital that will be available to us in the future if at all may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than what we currently experience if we are unable to raise or refinance debt then our equity investors may not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or to fund existing commitments to our portfolio companies significant changes or volatility in the capital markets may also have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our investments thus the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required and as a result we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes an inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations      table of contents uncertainty about the financial stability of the united states several countries in europe and china and uncertainties about the new us presidential administration could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations due to federal budget deficit concerns sp downgraded the federal governments credit rating from aaa to aa for the first time in history in august  further moodys and fitch had warned that they may downgrade the federal governments credit rating further downgrades or warnings by sp or other rating agencies and the united states governments credit and deficit concerns in general could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise which may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated with our debt portfolio and our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms in addition a decreased us government credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty which may weigh heavily on our financial performance and the value of our common stock in  a financial crisis emerged in europe triggered by high budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign debt in greece ireland italy portugal and spain which created concerns about the ability of these nations to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations while the financial stability of many of such countries has improved significantly risks resulting from any future debt crisis in europe or any similar crisis could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery sovereign and nonsovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices among other factors we cannot assure you that market disruptions in europe including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions will not impact the global economy and we cannot assure you that assistance packages will be available or if available be sufficient to stabilize countries and markets in europe or elsewhere affected by a financial crisis to the extent uncertainty regarding any economic recovery in europe negatively impacts consumer confidence and consumer credit factors our business financial condition and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected in the second quarter of  stock prices in china experienced a significant drop resulting primarily from continued selloff of shares trading in chinese markets in addition in august  chinese authorities sharply devalued chinas currency since then the chinese capital markets have continued to experience periods of instability these market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect the us capital markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate in december  and again in december  and has announced its intention to continue to raise the federal funds rate over time these developments along with the united states governments credit and deficit concerns the european sovereign debt crisis and the economic slowdown in china could cause interest rates to be volatile which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms in november  the united states held its federal election and elected donald trump the republican party nominee as president following president trumps inauguration in january  the republican party controls both the executive and legislative branches of government which increases the likelihood that legislation will be adopted implementing the policies of the trump administration while campaigning president trump made statements suggesting he may seek to have congress adopt legislation that could significantly affect the regulation of united states financial markets areas subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the dodd  frank act including the volcker rule and various swaps and derivatives regulations the authority of the federal reserve and the financial stability oversight council and renewed proposals to separate banks commercial and investment banking activities president trump also stated he would cause the united states to withdraw from or renegotiate various trade agreements and take other actions that would change current trade policies of the united states we cannot predict which if any of these actions will be taken or if taken their effect on the financial stability of the united states such actions could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the us economy and securities markets or on our investments we monitor developments and seek to manage our investments in a manner consistent with achieving our investment objective but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so      table of contents any further disruptive conditions in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those conditions could restrict our business operations and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition the business development company market may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or other factors and to the extent the business development company market trades down our shares might likewise be affected if the fair value of our assets declines substantially we may fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios imposed upon us by the  act any such failure would affect our ability to issue securities including borrowings and pay dividends which could materially impair our business operations our liquidity could be impaired further by an inability to access the capital markets or to consummate new borrowing facilities to provide capital for normal operations including new originations in recent years reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers our business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or stockholder activism which could cause us to incur significant expense hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities classaction litigation has often been brought against that company stockholder activism which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations has been increasing in the business development company space recently while we are currently not subject to any securities litigation or stockholder activism due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons we may in the future become the target of securities litigation or stockholder activism securities litigation and stockholder activism including potential proxy contests could result in substantial costs and divert managements and our board of directors attention and resources from our business additionally such securities litigation and stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist stockholder matters further our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and stockholder activism we operate in a highly competitive market for direct equity investment opportunities a large number of entities compete with us to make the types of direct equity investments that we target as part of our business strategy we compete for such investments with a large number of private equity and venture capital funds other equity and nonequity based investment funds investment banks and other sources of financing including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and specialty finance companies many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have considerably greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do for example some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us in addition some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us furthermore many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the  act imposes on us as a business development company there can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations also as a result of this competition we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make direct equity investments that are consistent with our investment objective the management and incentive fees may induce gsv asset management to make speculative investments the incentive fee payable by us to gsv asset management may create an incentive for gsv asset management to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement the way in which the incentive fee payable to gsv asset management is determined which is calculated as a percentage of the return on invested capital may encourage gsv asset management to use leverage to increase the return on our investments in addition the fact that our base management fee is payable based upon our gross assets which is our total assets as      table of contents reflected on our balance sheet with no deduction for liabilities may encourage gsv asset management to use leverage to make additional investments on september   we completed a private placement of  million in aggregate principal amount of year unsecured  convertible senior notes the convertible senior notes we will be required however to obtain the approval of our board of directors before we incur any additional indebtedness under certain circumstances the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default which would disfavor holders of our common stock such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case which could result in higher investment losses particularly during cyclical economic downturns in addition gsv asset management has control over the timing of the acquisition and dispositions of our investments and therefore over when we realize gains and losses on our investments as a result gsv asset management and those of our interested directors who are compensated by gsv asset management as employees of or consultants to gsv asset management based on the management and incentive fees paid by us to gsv asset management may face a conflict of interest in determining when it is appropriate to dispose of a specific investment to the extent doing so may serve to maximize the incentive fee at a point where disposing of such investment may not necessarily be in the best interests of our stockholders the independent members of our board of directors monitor such conflicts of interest in connection with their review of the performance of gsv asset management under our investment advisory agreement as well as during their quarterly review of our financial performance and results of operations borrowings such as the convertible senior notes can magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us borrowings also known as leverage magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities in addition to the convertible senior notes we may borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks insurance companies and other lenders lenders of such senior securities would have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders if the value of our assets increases then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged conversely if the value of our assets decreases leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged similarly any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage while any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique our ability to service the convertible senior notes and any future debt that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures moreover as the management fee payable to gsv asset management will be payable on our gross assets including those assets acquired through the use of leverage gsv asset management may have a financial incentive to incur additional leverage which may not be consistent with our stockholders interests in addition our common stockholders will bear the burden of any increase in our expenses as a result of such leverage including any increase in the management fee payable to gsv asset management as a result of our use of leverage we have experienced a substantial increase in operating expenses and may continue to do so in the future our use of borrowed funds to make investments exposes us to risks typically associated with leverage we borrow money and may issue additional debt securities or preferred stock to leverage our capital structure as a result  shares of our common stock would be exposed to incremental risk of loss therefore a decrease in the value of our investments would have a greater negative impact on the value of our common shares than if we did not use leverage  any depreciation in the value of our assets may magnify losses associated with an investment and could totally eliminate the value of an asset to us  if we do not appropriately match the assets and liabilities of our business and interest or dividend rates on such assets and liabilities adverse changes in interest rates could reduce or eliminate the incremental income we make with the proceeds of any leverage      table of contents  our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be restricted if our asset coverage ratio as provided in the  act is not at least  and any amounts used to service indebtedness or preferred stock would not be available for such dividends  any credit facility would be subject to periodic renewal by our lenders whose continued participation cannot be guaranteed  such securities would be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility or affecting our investment or operating policies and may require us to pledge assets or provide other security for such indebtedness  we and indirectly our common stockholders bear the entire cost of issuing and paying interest or dividends on such securities  if we issue preferred stock the special voting rights and preferences of preferred stockholders may result in such stockholders having interests that are not aligned with the interests of our common stockholders and the rights of our preferred stockholders to dividends and liquidation preferences will be senior to the rights of our common stockholders  any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common shares and  any custodial relationships associated with our use of leverage would conform to the requirements of the  act and no creditor would have veto power over our investment policies strategies objectives or decisions except in an event of default or if our asset coverage was less than  under the provisions of the  act we are permitted as a business development company to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio equals at least  after each issuance of senior securities if the value of our assets declines we may be unable to satisfy this test and we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and depending on the nature of our leverage repay a portion of our senior securities at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous there are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns and limit the flexibility of our investment policies we have entered into an investment advisory agreement with gsv asset management gsv asset management is controlled by michael t moe our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors messrs moe tanona and flynn as principals of gsv asset management collectively manage the business and internal affairs of gsv asset management in addition gsv capital service company provides us with office facilities and administrative services pursuant to an administration agreement gsv capital service company is controlled by gsv asset management while there is no limit on the total amount of expenses we may be required to reimburse to gsv capital service company our administrator will only charge us for the actual expenses it incurs on our behalf or our allocable portion thereof without any profit to gsv capital service company as discussed above gsv asset management has control over the timing of the acquisition and dispositions of our investments and therefore over when we realize gains and losses on our investments as a result gsv asset management and those of our interested directors who are compensated by gsv asset management as employees of or consultants to gsv asset management may face a conflict of interest in determining when it is appropriate to dispose of a specific investment to the extent doing so may serve to maximize the incentive fee at a point where disposing of such investment may not necessarily be in the best interests of our stockholders in addition mark klein a member of our board of directors or entities with which he is affiliated receives fees from gsv asset management equal to a percentage of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee paid by us to gsv asset management pursuant to a consulting agreement with gsv asset management further our executive officers and directors and the principals of our investment adviser gsv asset management serve or may serve as officers and directors of entities that operate in a line of business similar to our own including new entities that may be formed in the future accordingly they may have obligations to investors in those entities the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our      table of contents stockholders for example gsv asset management also serves as subadviser to the gsv ventures funds and manages the coursera funds we have no ownership interests in the coursera funds or the gsv ventures funds subadvised by gsv asset management while the investment focus of each of these entities including the gsv ventures funds and the coursera funds may be different from our investment objective it is likely that new investment opportunities that meet our investment objective will come to the attention of one of these entities or new entities that will likely be formed in the future in connection with another investment advisory client or program and if so such opportunity might not be offered or otherwise made available to us however our executive officers directors and gsv asset management intend to treat us in a fair and equitable manner consistent with their applicable duties under law so that we will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other particular client in addition while gsv asset management anticipates that it will from time to time identify investment opportunities that are appropriate for both gsv capital and the other funds that are currently or in the future may be managed by gsv asset management to the extent it does identify such opportunities gsv asset management has established an allocation policy to ensure that we have priority over such other funds our board of directors will monitor on a quarterly basis any such allocation of investment opportunities between us and any such other funds gsv asset management is the owner of the gsv name and marks which we are permitted to use pursuant to a nonexclusive license agreement between us and gsv asset management gsv asset management and its principals also use and may permit other entities to use the gsv name and marks in connection with businesses and activities unrelated to our operations the use of the gsv name and marks in connection with businesses and activities unrelated to our operations may not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders and may result in actual or perceived conflicts of interest finally we pay gsv capital service company our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by gsv capital service company in performing its obligations under the administration agreement including a portion of the rent and the compensation of our president chief financial officer chief compliance officer and other staff providing any administrative services which creates conflicts of interest that our board of directors must monitor gsv asset management has the right to resign on  days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition business and results of operations gsv asset management has the right under the investment advisory agreement to resign at any time upon not more than  days written notice whether we have found a replacement or not if gsv asset management resigns we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within  days or at all if we are unable to do so quickly our operations are likely to experience a disruption our financial condition business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline in addition the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by gsv asset management and its affiliates even if we are able to retain comparable management whether internal or external the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our financial condition business and results of operations we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income although we focus on achieving capital gains from our investments in certain cases we may receive current income such as interest or dividends on our investments because in certain cases we may recognize such current income before or without receiving cash representing such income we may have difficulty satisfying the annual distribution requirement applicable to rics accordingly in order to maintain our qualification as a ric we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider      table of contents advantageous raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investments to meet these distribution requirements if we are not able to obtain cash from other sources we may fail to qualify for ric tax treatment and thus would be subject to corporatelevel us federal income tax regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to and the way in which we raise additional capital which may expose us to risks including the typical risks associated with leverage we may in the future issue additional debt securities or preferred stock andor borrow money from banks or other financial institutions which we refer to collectively along with the convertible senior notes as senior securities up to the maximum amount permitted by the  act under the provisions of the  act we are permitted as a business development company to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio as defined in the  act equals at least  of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities after each issuance of senior securities if the value of our assets declines we may be unable to satisfy this test if that happens we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and depending on the nature of our leverage repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous furthermore any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common stockholders all of the costs of offering and servicing the convertible senior notes and any additional debt or preferred stock we may issue in the future including interest or preferential dividend payments thereon will be borne by our common stockholders the interests of the holders of the convertible senior notes any additional debt or preferred stock we may issue will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of our common stockholders in particular the rights of holders of the convertible senior notes and our debt or preferred stock to receive interest dividends or principal repayment will be senior to those of our common stockholders also in the event we issue preferred stock the holders of such preferred stock will have the ability to elect two members of our board of directors in addition we may grant a lender a security interest in a significant portion or all of our assets even if the total amount we may borrow from such lender is less than the amount of such lenders security interest in our assets in no event however will any lender to us have any veto power over or any vote with respect to any change in our or approval of any new investment objective or investment policies or strategies we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share we may however sell our common stock or warrants options or rights to acquire our common stock at a price below the thencurrent net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of gsv capital and its stockholders and our stockholders approve such sale in any such case the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which in the determination of our board of directors closely approximates the market value of such securities less any distributing commission or discount we are also generally prohibited under the  act from issuing securities convertible into voting securities without obtaining the approval of our existing stockholders in addition to regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to raise capital the convertible senior notes contain various covenants which if not complied with could require us to repurchase the convertible senior notes thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity financial condition results of operations and ability to pay dividends the convertible senior notes require us to comply with certain financial and operational covenants these covenants require us to among other things maintain certain financial ratios including asset coverage debt to equity and interest coverage our ability to continue to comply with these covenants in the future depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control there are no assurances that we will be able to comply with these covenants failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default which if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders under the convertible senior notes and accelerate repurchase of the convertible senior notes would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition results of operations and ability to pay dividends in addition holders of the convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase the convertible senior notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental      table of contents change at a repurchase price equal to  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases we will be subject to corporatelevel us federal income tax if we are profitable and are unable to qualify as a ric which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders we elected to be treated as a ric under the code beginning with our taxable year ended december   have qualified to be treated as a ric for subsequent taxable years and expect to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics for the fiscal year ended  however we failed to satisfy certain tests required for us to qualify as a ric under the code and were therefore subject to corporatelevel us federal income tax in september  we filed our  tax return as a ric and sought to be granted ric status for our  taxable year however we determined we would not be eligible to elect to be treated as a ric for the  taxable year unless we were certified by the sec as principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions technological improvements new processes or products not previously generally available for the  taxable year in september  we had not received such sec certification for our  taxable year and we determined it was in the best interests of our stockholders to file the  tax return as a c corporation as of march   we had not received and do not anticipate receiving such sec certification for our  taxable year we do not intend to pursue this certification with the sec see business  material us federal income tax considerations and note   nature of operations and significant accounting policies  summary of significant accounting policies  us federal and state income taxes and note   income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for more information management generally believes that it will be in our best interests to be treated a ric in any year in which we are profitable if we fail to qualify as a ric for any year in which we are profitable and such profits exceed certain loss carryforwards that we are entitled to utilize we will be subject to corporatelevel us federal income tax which could substantially reduce our net assets the amount of income available for distribution or reinvestment and the amount of our distributions such a failure could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are morelikelythannot to be sustained by the applicable tax authority we recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position has met the morelikelythannot threshold we classify penalties and interest associated with income taxes if any as income tax expense conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including but not limited to ongoing analyses of tax laws regulations and interpretations thereof we have identified our major tax jurisdictions as us federal and california in any year in which we intend to be treated as a ric we may be forced to dispose of investments at times when gsv asset management would not otherwise do so or raise additional capital at times when we would not otherwise do so in each case in order to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded to rics to qualify for the special treatment accorded to rics we must meet certain income source asset diversification and annual distribution requirements in order to satisfy the income source requirement we must derive in each taxable year at least  of our gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or income from qualified publicly traded partnerships to qualify as a ric we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year failure to meet these tests in any year in which we intend to be treated as a ric may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of ric status because most of our investments are in private companies any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses in addition in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement for a ric we must distribute at least  of our ordinary income and realized net shortterm capital gains in excess of realized net longterm capital losses if any to      table of contents our stockholders on an annual basis we will be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the  act and financial covenants under the terms of our indebtedness that could under certain circumstances restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the annual distribution requirement if we are unable to dispose of investments quickly enough to meet the asset diversification requirements at the end of a quarter or obtain cash from other sources in order to meet the annual distribution requirement we may fail to qualify for special tax treatment accorded to rics and thus be subject to corporatelevel us federal income tax because we expect to distribute substantially all of our net investment income and net realized capital gains to our stockholders we will need additional capital to finance our growth and such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all we have elected to be taxed for us federal income tax purposes as a ric under subchapter m of the code if we meet certain requirements including source of income asset diversification and distribution requirements and if we continue to qualify as a business development company we will continue to qualify to be a ric under the code and will not have to pay corporatelevel income taxes on income we distribute to our stockholders as dividends allowing us to substantially reduce or eliminate our us federal corporatelevel income tax liability as a business development company we are generally required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future of at least  at the time we issue any debt or preferred stock this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow because we will continue to need capital to grow our investment portfolio this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt or preferred stock and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so we cannot assure you that debt and equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all and debt financings may be restricted by the terms of any of our outstanding borrowings in addition as a business development company we are generally not permitted to issue common stock priced below net asset value without stockholder approval if additional funds are not available to us we could be forced to curtail or cease new lending and investment activities and our net asset value could decline we may continue to choose to pay dividends in our common stock in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive we have in the past and may continue to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in shares of our common stock for example on november   our board of directors declared a dividend of  per share to stockholders paid in part cash and part shares of our common stock on december   in accordance with certain applicable treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by the internal revenue service irs a ric may treat a distribution of its own common stock as fulfilling the ric distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or common stock of the ric subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least  of the aggregate declared distribution if too many stockholders elect to receive cash each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash with the balance of the distribution paid in common stock in no event will any stockholder electing to receive cash receive less than  of his or her entire distribution in cash if these and certain other requirements are met for us federal income tax purposes the amount of the dividend paid in common stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of common stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income or as longterm capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock in addition if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock      table of contents even in the event the value of your investment declines the base management fee will still be payable under the terms of the investment advisory agreement the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of  of the value of our gross assets which we pay monthly in arrears effective january   through december   however pursuant to a voluntary waiver by gsv asset management we will pay gsv asset management a base management fee of  a  reduction from the  base management fee payable under the investment advisory agreement this waiver of a portion of the base management fee is not subject to recourse against or reimbursement by us the base management fee is payable regardless of whether the value of our gross assets or your investment declines as a result we will owe gsv asset management a base management fee regardless of whether we incurred significant realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation losses during the period for which the base management fee is paid we incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly traded company as a publicly traded company we incur legal accounting and other expenses including costs associated with the periodic reporting requirements applicable to a company whose securities are registered under the exchange act as well as additional corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act and other rules implemented by the sec we may in the future determine to fund a portion of our investments with preferred stock which would magnify the potential for gain or loss and the risks of investing in us in the same way as our borrowings preferred stock which is another form of leverage has the same risks to our common stockholders as borrowings because the dividends on any preferred stock we issue must be cumulative payment of such dividends and repayment of the liquidation preference of such preferred stock must take preference over any dividends or other payments to our common stockholders and preferred stockholders are not subject to any of our expenses or losses and are not entitled to participate in any income or appreciation in excess of their stated preference our board of directors is authorized to reclassify any unissued shares of stock into one or more classes of preferred stock which could convey special rights and privileges to its owners our charter permits our board of directors to reclassify any authorized but unissued shares of stock into one or more classes of preferred stock our board of directors will generally have broad discretion over the size and timing of any such reclassification subject to a finding that the reclassification and issuance of such preferred stock is in the best interests of gsv capital and our existing common stockholders any issuance of preferred stock would be subject to certain limitations imposed under the  act including the requirement that such preferred stock have equal voting rights with our outstanding common stock we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock in the event our board of directors opts to reclassify a portion of our unissued shares of common stock into a class of preferred stock those preferred shares would have a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation the cost of any such reclassification would be borne by our existing common stockholders in addition the  act provides that holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote separately from holders of common stock to elect two directors as a result our preferred stockholders will have the ability to reject a director that would otherwise be elected by our common stockholders in addition while maryland law generally requires directors to act in the best interests of all of a corporations stockholders there can be no assurance that a director elected by our preferred stockholders will not choose to act in a manner that tends to favors our preferred stockholders particularly where there is a conflict between the interests of our preferred stockholders and our common stockholders the class voting rights of any preferred shares we may issue could make it more difficult for us to take some actions that may in the future be proposed by the board of directors andor the holders of our common stock such as a merger exchange of securities liquidation or alteration of the rights of a class of our securities if these actions were perceived by the holders of preferred shares as not in their best interests the issuance of preferred shares convertible into shares of common stock might also reduce the net income and net asset value per share of our common stock upon conversion these effects among others could have an adverse effect on your investment in our common stock      table of contents our board of directors may change our investment objective operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval the effects of which may be adverse our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive our investment objective current operating policies investment criteria and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval we cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies investment criteria and strategies would have on our business net asset value operating results and value of our stock however the effects might be adverse which could negatively impact our ability to pay you dividends and cause you to lose all or part of your investment provisions of the maryland general corporation law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock our charter and bylaws as well as certain statutory and regulatory requirements contain certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us our bylaws contain a provision exempting any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares of stock from the control share act under the maryland general corporation law if our board of directors does not otherwise approve a business combination the control share act if we amend our bylaws to be subject to that act may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer additionally under our charter our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered terms our board of directors may without stockholder action authorize the issuance of shares of stock in one or more classes or series including preferred stock and our board of directors may without stockholder action amend our charter to increase the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue these antitakeover provisions may inhibit a change of control in circumstances that could otherwise give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for our common stock we are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business which may in turn negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability make distributions our business is highly dependent on our and third parties communications and information systems any failure or interruption of those systems including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any thirdparty service providers could cause delays or other problems in our activities our financial accounting data processing backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and may adversely affect our business there could be  sudden electrical or telecommunications outages  natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes  disease pandemics  events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including terrorist acts and  cyberattacks these events in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders terrorist attacks acts of war or natural disasters may affect any market for our securities impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business operating results and financial condition terrorist acts acts of war or natural disasters may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of the businesses in which we invest such acts have created and continue to create economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability future terrorist activities military or security operations or natural disasters could further weaken the domesticglobal economies and create additional uncertainties which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition losses from terrorist attacks and natural disasters are generally uninsurable      table of contents we face cybersecurity risks our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data processing storage and reporting despite careful security and controls design implementation and updating our information technology systems could become subject to cyberattacks network system application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the failure in cyber security systems as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively the occurrence of a disaster such as a cyberattack a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a terrorist attack or war events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems or a support failure from external providers could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if those events affect our computerbased data processing transmission storage and retrieval systems or destroy data if a significant number of our managers were unavailable in the event of a disaster our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised we depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions despite our implementation of a variety of security measures our computer systems could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access such as physical and electronic breakins or unauthorized tampering like other companies we may experience threats to our data and systems including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access system failures and disruptions if one or more of these events occurs it could potentially jeopardize the confidential proprietary and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations which could result in damage to our reputation financial losses litigation increased costs regulatory penalties andor customer dissatisfaction or loss risks related to our convertible senior notes our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our convertible senior notes our convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock upon conversion we must deliver shares of our common stock the conversion rate of our convertible senior notes is  shares of common stock per  principal amount of the convertible senior notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately  per share of common stock based on the current conversion rate the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the  million convertible debt currently outstanding is  if we deliver shares of common stock upon a conversion at the time our net asset value per share exceeds the conversion price in effect at such time our stockholders will incur dilution in addition our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of our convertible senior notes and any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance we may not have or have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase our convertible senior notes upon a fundamental change and our debt may contain limitations on our ability to deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion or pay cash upon repurchase of our convertible senior notes holders of our convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of certain significant corporate events involving us including if our common stock ceases to trade on any national securities exchange or we consolidate or merge into another entity in certain circumstances at a repurchase price equal to  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any we refer to such a corporate event as a fundamental change however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of convertible senior notes surrendered therefor in addition our ability to repurchase our convertible senior notes or deliver shares of our common stock upon conversions of the convertible senior notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness our failure to      table of contents repurchase the notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture relating to the convertible senior notes or to deliver any shares of our common stock deliverable on future conversions of the convertible senior notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the indenture or the occurrence of a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our indebtedness if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase our convertible senior notes provisions of our convertible senior notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party certain provisions of our convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change the holders of our convertible senior notes will have the right at their option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest we may also be required to increase the conversion rate of the convertible senior notes in certain other circumstances including in the event of certain fundamental changes these provisions could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party certain adverse consequences could result if our convertible senior notes are treated as equity interests in us for purposes of regulations under the employee retirement income security act of  pursuant to regulations under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa it is possible that due to their convertibility feature our convertible senior notes could be treated as equity interests in us in that event if employee benefit plans subject to title i of erisa plans that are not subject to erisa but that are subject to section  of the code such as individual retirement accounts and entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans or accounts such plans accounts and entities benefit plan investors were to acquire  or more of the aggregate value of our convertible senior notes among other consequences we and our management would be subject to erisa fiduciary duties and certain transactions we might enter into or may have entered into in the ordinary course of our business might constitute nonexempt prohibited transactions under section  of erisa or section  of the code and might have to be rescinded at significant cost to us moreover if our underlying assets were deemed to be assets constituting plan assets i our assets could be subject to erisas reporting and disclosure requirements ii a fiduciary causing a benefit plan investor to make an investment in our equity interests could be deemed to have delegated its responsibility to manage the assets of the benefit plan investor and iii various providers of fiduciary or other services to us and any other parties with authority or control with respect to our assets could be deemed to be plan fiduciaries or otherwise partiesininterest or disqualified persons by virtue of their provision of such services we do not believe that our convertible senior notes should be treated as equity interests in us for purposes of erisa in light of the relevant regulations no assurance can be given however that our convertible senior notes will not be so treated the accounting for convertible debt securities is complex and subject to uncertainty the accounting for convertible debt securities is complex and subject to frequent scrutiny by the accounting regulatory bodies and is subject to change the issuance of our convertible senior notes may affect our earnings per share on a fully diluted basis in certain periods further we cannot predict if or when changes in the accounting for convertible debt securities could be made and whether any such change could have an adverse impact on our reported or future financial results any such impacts could adversely affect the market price or value of our common stock      table of contents risks related to an investment in our securities our common stock price may be volatile and may decrease substantially the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market after any future offering may be higher or lower than the price you pay depending on many factors some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance these factors include but are not limited to the following  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  investor demand for our shares  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of rics business development companies or other financial services companies  changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines with respect to rics or business development companies  failure to qualify as a ric for a particular taxable year or the loss of ric status  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or changes in the expectations of securities analysts  general economic conditions and trends  fluctuations in the valuation of our portfolio investments  operating performance of companies comparable to us  market sentiment against technologyrelated companies or  departures of any of the senior investment professionals of gsv asset management in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company due to the potential volatility of our stock price we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources from our business shares of our common stock have recently traded and may in the future trade at discounts from net asset value or at premiums that may prove to be unsustainable shares of business development companies like us may during some periods trade at prices higher than their net asset value per share and during other periods as frequently occurs with closedend investment companies trade at prices lower than their net asset value per share the perceived value of our investment portfolio may be affected by a number of factors including perceived prospects for individual companies we invest in market conditions for common stock generally for ipos and other exit events for venturecapitalbacked companies and the mix of companies in our investment portfolio over time negative or unforeseen developments affecting the perceived value of companies in our investment portfolio could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock relative to our net asset value per share the possibility that our shares will trade at a discount from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable are risks separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share will decrease the risk of purchasing shares of a business development company that might trade at a discount or unsustainable premium is more pronounced for investors who wish to sell their shares in a relatively short period of time because for those investors realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent upon changes in premium or discount levels than upon increases or decreases in net asset value per share as of march   the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market was  per share which represented an approximately  discount to our net asset value of  per share as of december        table of contents there is a risk that you may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time particularly since we invest primarily in securities that do not produce current income we cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results or

amount of realized capital gains available for distribution to stockholders will be impacted by our tax status our current intention is to make any distributions out of assets legally available in additional shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan except in the case of stockholders who elect to receive dividends andor longterm capital gains distributions in cash under the dividend reinvestment plan if a stockholder owns shares of common stock registered in its own name the stockholder will have all cash distributions net of any applicable withholding automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock unless the stockholder opts out of our dividend reinvestment plan by delivering a written notice to our dividend paying agent prior to the record date of the next dividend or distribution any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless be treated as received by the us stockholder for us federal income tax purposes although no cash distribution has been made as a result if a stockholder does not elect to opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan it will be required to pay applicable federal state and local taxes on any reinvested dividends even though it will not receive a corresponding cash distribution in addition reinvested dividends have the effect of increasing our gross assets which may correspondingly increase the management fee payable to gsv asset management if stockholders hold shares in the name of a broker or financial intermediary they should contact the broker or financial intermediary regarding their election to receive distributions in cash      table of contents performance graph the following graph compares the cumulative total return on our common stock with that of the standard  poors  stock index and the nasdaq stock index as we do not believe there is an appropriate index of companies with an investment strategy similar to our own with which to compare the return on our common stock for the five years ended december   the graph assumes that on december   a person invested  in our common stock at the closing price of our common stock on december   and in the standard  poors  stock index and the nasdaq stock index the graph measures total stockholder return which takes into account both changes in stock price and dividends it assumes that dividends are

uncertainties these forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates and projections about us our current and prospective portfolio investments our industry our beliefs and our assumptions words such as anticipates expects intends plans will may continue believes seeks estimates would could should targets projects and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form k involve risks and uncertainties including statements as to  our future operating results  our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies  the impact of investments that we expect to make  our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties  the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest  the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives  our expected financings and investments  the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital and  the timing of cash flows if any from the operations of our portfolio companies these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forwardlooking statements including without limitation  an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies  an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the market sectors in which a significant portion of our portfolio is concentrated causing us to suffer losses in our portfolio  a contraction of available credit andor an inability to access the equity markets could impair our investment activities  interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results particularly because we use leverage as part of our investment strategy and  the risks uncertainties and other factors we identify in risk factors in this annual report on form k and in our filings with the sec although we believe that the assumptions on which these forwardlooking statements are based are reasonable any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and as a result the forwardlooking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate important assumptions include our ability to originate new investments certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital in light of these and other uncertainties the inclusion of a projection or forwardlooking statement in this annual report on form k should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved these risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in this annual report on form k in the risk factors section you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k      table of contents the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k overview we are an externally managed nondiversified closedend management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the  act our investment objective is to maximize our portfolios total return principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equityrelated investments we invest principally in the equity securities of what we believe to be rapidly growing venturecapitalbacked emerging companies we have also invested on an opportunistic basis in select publicly traded equity securities of rapidly growing companies that otherwise meet our investment criteria and may continue to do so in the future in addition while we invest primarily in us companies we may invest on an opportunistic basis in certain nonus companies that otherwise meet our investment criteria in regards to the regulatory requirements for business development companies under the  act some of these investments may not qualify as investments in eligible portfolio companies and thus may not be considered qualifying assets eligible portfolio companies generally include us companies that are not investment companies and that do not have securities listed on a national exchange if at any time less than  of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets including as a result of an increase in the value of any nonqualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional nonqualifying assets until such time as  of our thencurrent gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets we would not be required however to dispose of any nonqualifying assets in such circumstances see business  operating and regulatory structure we acquire our investments in portfolio companies through offerings of the prospective portfolio companies transactions on secondary marketplaces for private companies and negotiations with selling stockholders our investment activities are managed by gsv asset management gsv capital service company provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate our investment philosophy is premised on a disciplined approach of identifying highgrowth emerging companies across several key industry themes that may include among others social mobile cloud computing and big data internet commerce sustainability and education technology gsv asset managements investment decisions are based on a disciplined analysis of available information regarding each potential portfolio companys business operations focusing on the companys growth potential the quality of recurring revenues and cash flow and cost structures as well as an understanding of key market fundamentals many of the companies that our investment adviser gsv asset management evaluates have financial backing from toptier venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors we seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of noncontrolling equity and equityrelated investments including common stock warrants preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio companys common equity and convertible debt securities with a significant equity component typically our preferred stock investments are nonincome producing have different voting rights than common stock and are generally convertible into common stock at our discretion our investments generally do not produce current income and therefore we may be dependent on future capital raising to meet our operating needs if no other source of liquidity is available investments  portfolio activity the value of our investment portfolio will change over time due to changes in the fair value of our underlying investments as well as changes in

primarily due to increased interest income and other income received in  the increase in interest income resulted from our acquisition of interestbearing debt investments during the fiscal year ended december   as of december   the cost of our debt investments increased to  from  as of december   the increase in other income between periods resulted from the proceeds from michael moes sale of common shares of u inc fka tor inc one of our former portfolio companies that mr moe received while serving on the u board of directors the sales proceeds were remitted directly to the company pursuant to gsv asset managements internal policy whereby any fees or compensation received by a manager partner officer or employee of gsv asset management in exchange for serving as a director of or providing consulting services to any of our portfolio companies will be transferred to us net of any personal taxes incurred upon such receipt for the benefit of us and our stockholders investment income increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   the increase was primarily due to the addition of several new term loans to fullbridge inc during the year ended december   operating expenses total operating expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   total operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of the reversal of previously accrued incentive fees during the year ended december   which was the result of the realization of  in net losses on investments in the year ended december   as compared to  in net realized gains on investments in the year ended december   the unrealized depreciation of our portfolio investments in the aggregate during the year ended december   also contributed to the reversal of previously accrued incentive fees total operating expenses also decreased due to lower management fees resulting from lower average gross assets outstanding as well as a decrease in interest expense resulting from lower average borrowings under the  million senior secured credit facility with silicon valley bank the credit facility there was also no income tax expense incurred for the year ended december   these decreases were minimally offset by an increase in other expenses and professional fees which include legal valuation audit and consulting fees total operating expenses increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   the increase was primarily due to a significant increase in accrued incentive fees and an increase in management fees this was offset by decreases in interest expense professional fees which include legal valuation audit and consulting fees and costs incurred under the administration agreement the increase in incentive fees resulted from the significant increase in realized gains on investments for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the increased management fees were a result of the growth in our average total assets for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   this increase was partially offset by the decline in the fair value of our portfolio investments over the same period the decrease in interest expense resulted from the lower average borrowings under the credit facility for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the decrease in costs incurred under the administration agreement resulted from a decrease in the overhead allocation the decrease in professional fees resulted primarily from the writeoff of deferred offering costs during the year ended december        table of contents provisionbenefit for taxes on net investment loss for the year ended december   we recognized no

executive officers screen each of our transactions for any possible affiliations between the proposed portfolio investment us companies controlled by us and our executive officers and directors we also adopted a code of ethics which applies to among others our senior officers including our chief executive officer president chief financial officer and chief compliance officer as well as our other officers directors and employees our code of ethics requires that all employees and directors avoid any conflict or the appearance of a conflict between an individuals personal interests and our interests pursuant to our code of ethics each officer employee and director must disclose any conflicts of interest or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict to our chief compliance officer our board of directors is charged with approving any waivers under our code of ethics as required by the nasdaq corporate governance listing standards the audit committee of our board of directors is also required to review and approve any transactions with related parties as such term is defined in item  of regulation sk critical accounting policies critical accounting policies and practices are the policies that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain these include estimates of the fair value of our level  investments and other estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period it is likely that changes in these estimates will occur in the near term our estimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ materially from such estimates we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective and complex judgments      table of contents investments at fair value we apply fair value accounting in accordance with gaap and the aicpas audit and accounting guide for investment companies we value our assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if required under the  act fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date gaap establishes a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement the levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level    valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access at the measurement date level    valuations based on observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level    valuations based on unobservable inputs that reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model the majority of the companys investments are level  investments and are subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty in determining fair value when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety for example a level  fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable levels  and  and unobservable level  therefore gains and losses for such assets and liabilities categorized within the level  table set forth in note   investments at fair value to our consolidated financial statements as of december   may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs levels  and  and unobservable inputs level  a review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities reclassifications impacting level  of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers inout of the level  category as of the end of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur refer to note   nature of operations and significant accounting policies  levelling policy to our consolidated financial statements as of december   for a detailed discussion of the levelling of our financial assets or liabilities and events that may cause a reclassification within the fair value hierarchy securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the closing price of such security on the valuation date however if they are subject to restrictions upon sale such as lockup restrictions they may be discounted accordingly we may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services brokers or dealers in order to value assets when doing so we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to gaap to determine the fair value of the security if determined to be adequate we use the quote obtained      table of contents securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that in the judgment of gsv asset management our board of directors or the valuation committee does not reliably represent fair value shall each be valued as follows  the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of gsv asset management responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with gsv asset management senior management  an independent thirdparty valuation firm is engaged by the valuation committee to conduct independent appraisals and review gsv asset managements preliminary valuations and make its own independent assessment for all investments for which there are no readily available market quotations  the valuation committee discusses the valuations and recommends to our board of directors a fair value for each investment in the portfolio based on the input of gsv asset management and the independent thirdparty valuation firm and  our board of directors then discusses the valuations recommended by the valuation committee and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in making a good faith determination of the fair value of investments we consider valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice valuation methods utilized include but are not limited to the following comparisons to prices from secondary market transactions venture capital financings public offerings purchase or sales transactions as well as analysis of financial ratios and valuation metrics of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public analysis of the portfolio companies most recent financial statements and forecasts and the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors we assign a weighting based upon the relevance of each method to determine the fair value of each investment the valuation committee engages at least one independent valuation firm to perform valuations of our investments that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations our board of directors considers the independent valuations provided by the valuation firms among other factors in making our fair value determinations recent developments portfolio activity from and including january   through march   we did not close on any investment purchases from and including january   through march   we did not sell any investments we are frequently in negotiations with various private companies with respect to investments in such companies investments in private companies are generally subject to satisfaction of applicable closing conditions in the case of secondary market transactions such closing conditions may include approval of the issuer waiver or failure to exercise rights of first refusal by the issuer andor its stockholders and termination rights by the seller or us equity investments made through the secondary market may involve making deposits in escrow accounts until the applicable closing conditions are satisfied at which time the escrow accounts will close and such equity investments will be effectuated on march   snap inc listed its shares on the new york stock exchange in an ipo with an offering price of  per

management has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of the advisory fees payable by us to gsv asset management under the investment advisory agreement pursuant to the waiver effective january   through december   we will pay gsv asset management a base management fee of  a  reduction from the  base management fee payable under the investment advisory agreement this waiver of a portion of the base management fee is not subject to recourse against or reimbursement by us item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our equity investments are primarily in growth companies that in many cases have short operating histories and are generally illiquid in addition to the risk that these companies may fail to achieve their objectives the price we may receive for these companies in private transactions may be significantly impacted by periods of disruption and instability in the capital markets such as the recent market volatility in china geopolitical unrest in the middle east and as a result of the referendum vote relating to the united kingdoms exit from the eu while these periods of disruption generally have little actual impact on the operating results of our equity investments these events may significantly impact the prices that market participants will pay for our equity investments in private transactions this may have a significant impact on the valuation of our equity investments interest rate risk we are subject to financial market risks which could include to the extent we utilize leverage with variable rate structures changes in interest rates as we invest primarily in equity rather than debt instruments we would not expect fluctuations in interest rates to directly impact our return on our portfolio investments although any significant change in market interest rates could potentially have an indirect effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the portfolio companies

of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period it is likely that changes in these estimates will occur in the near term the companys estimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ materially from such estimates investments at fair value the company applies fair value accounting in accordance with gaap and the aicpas audit and accounting guide for investment companies the company values its assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if required under the  act fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date gaap establishes a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement the levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level    valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level    valuations based on observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level    valuations based on unobservable inputs that reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety for example a level  fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable levels  and  and unobservable level  therefore gains and losses for such assets and liabilities categorized within the level  table set forth in note   investments at fair value may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs levels  and  and unobservable inputs level       table of contents gsv capital corp and subsidiaries   notes to

basis changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities reclassifications impacting level  of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers inout of the level  category as of the end of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur refer to levelling policy below for a detailed discussion of the levelling of the companys financial assets or liabilities and events that may cause a reclassification within the fair value hierarchy securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the closing price of such security on the valuation date however if they are subject to restrictions upon sale such as lockup restrictions they may be discounted accordingly the company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments from pricing services brokers or dealers in order to value assets when doing so the company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to gaap to determine the fair value of the security if determined to be adequate the company uses the quote obtained securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that in the judgment of gsv asset management the companys board of directors or the valuation committee of the companys board of directors the valuation committee does not reliably represent fair value shall each be valued as follows  the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of gsv asset management responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with gsv asset management senior management  an independent thirdparty valuation firm is engaged by the valuation committee to conduct independent appraisals and review gsv asset managements preliminary valuations and make its own independent assessment for all investments for which there are no readily available market quotations  the valuation committee discusses the valuations and recommends to the companys board of directors a fair value for each investment in the portfolio based on the input of gsv asset management and the independent thirdparty valuation firm and  the companys board of directors then discusses the valuations recommended by the valuation committee and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in making a good faith determination of the fair value of investments the company considers valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice valuation methods utilized include but are not limited to the following comparisons to prices from secondary market transactions venture capital financings public offerings purchase or sales transactions as well as analysis of financial ratios and valuation metrics of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public analysis of the portfolio companies most

recently available historical and projected financial results public market comparables and other factors the company may also consider other events including the transaction in which the company acquired its securities subsequent equity sales by the portfolio company and mergers or acquisitions affecting the portfolio company in addition the company may consider the trends of the portfolio companys basic financial metrics from the time of its original investment until the measurement date with material improvement of these metrics indicating a possible increase in fair value while material deterioration of these metrics may indicate a possible reduction in fair value in determining the value of equity or equitylinked securities including warrants to purchase common or preferred stock in a portfolio company the company considers the rights preferences and limitations of such securities in cases where a portfolio companys capital structure includes multiple classes of preferred and common stock and equitylinked securities with different rights and preferences the company generally uses an option pricing model to allocate value to each equitylinked security unless it believes a liquidity event such as an acquisition or a dissolution is imminent or the portfolio company is unlikely to continue as a going concern when equitylinked securities expire worthless any
