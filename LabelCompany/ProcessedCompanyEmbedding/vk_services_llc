commentsa federal tax lien is a claim against property when you don’t pay your fist tax due a lean is filled and it is attached to any property you owe or any future rights you may have to a property this lien is reported to credit reporting agencies and have negative effect on your credit rating and make difficult for you to receive a credit such a loan or a credit card once your debt is fully paid off federal tax lien gets “released” or it can be “withdraw” if you make arrangements with irs such as installment agreement levy is a seizure of property while a lien is  claim against your property levy is actual legal seizure where irs actually takes your property or a right to a property to satisfy your tax debt if you have current installment agreement or  offer in compromise irs cannot asses a levy example of property that can be “levy” wages salary or commission bank accounts federal payments house car or other property property that cannot be seized unemployment benefits

agreement or offer in compromise by viktoriya khusit  may    blog   commentsnow tax season is over and hopefully you filled your tax return in my practice i have a few clients who owe a balance due on their returns my first and main advise file file your returns regardless of you having funds to pay your balance due if you don’t file before a due date you will be automatically assessed a fee for ” failure to file your tax return” you filled on timeyou already saved money so you have a balance what is your options of paying it best option is to pay it in full before a due date or after if you have to this can be done via direct debit  and irs will take only amount you indicated on the date you indicated on your authorization second option is a payment via creditdebit card you can do it by go to httpswwwirsgovuacpaytaxesbycreditordebitcard third option you can mail a physical check to the irs what if you need time or help  to pay your balance there are two options available installment agreement and offer of compromise installment agreement is a contract with irs where irs allows to make smaller periodic payments over time you can apply online httpswwwirsgovindividualsonlinepaymentagreementapplication or over the phone  or by mail if your balance is less than  you need form  if more than  use form fs  also you can fill out form  payroll deduction agreement and of course in person remember you will still be charged applicable penalties and interest also a notice of federal tax lien can be filled against you and this lien goes on your credit until you pay your balance in full but irs will send you a letter warning you that they are planning on filling a lien offer in compromise may be accepted by irs if you cannot pay in full or even through installments in short you will ask irs to settle unpaid taxes for less than what you owe offer in compromise may be accepted if – irs agrees that tax debt amount may not be  accurate
