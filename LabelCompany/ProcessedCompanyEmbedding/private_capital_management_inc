quantitative business assessment qualitative management and business assessment time horizon  investor expectations portfolio construction and sell discipline identify undervalued companies that can

emerging highimpact new business initiatives are subscale and are not yet visible to investors companies possess a complex business model or misunderstood asset base company specific strengths are ignored due to an uncertain industry outlook differences arise in analytical perspective time horizon our efforts to identify these opportunities takes on several forms criteria based financial screening referrals from our industry contacts and our own indepth knowledge developed over more than  years of public market investing  pcm’s screening process and broader investment approach is not limited by the market capitalization of a company  instead our size enables us to become meaningfully involved in investment situations that many investors consider too small for consideration in identifying opportunities pcm’s investment leverages its extensive domain expertise in diverse market segments such as technology financial services consumer discretionary healthcare natural resources and communications quantitative business assessment once a potential investment opportunity is identified pcm conducts exhaustive independent financial analysis focused on valuing a company’s business operations and assets over an identifiable investment horizon  included in this analysis is a focus on making financial statement adjustments to better reflect the true value of the company�s assets and liabilities as well as to identify any potential �footnote� risks such as underfunded pensions offbalance sheet liabilities environmental liabilities aggressive accounting procedures etc in our experience free cash flow is a superior measure for longterm investors     a common characteristic of superior businesses is their ability to generate sustainable and growing free cash flow pcm defines free cash flow as cash flow from operations less required capital expenditures we value businesses by taking the net present value npv of their free cash flow potential discounted by a rate commensurate with the perceived business risk and variability of the anticipated cash flow stream free cash flow affords management teams with myriad ways to enhance longterm shareholder value capital efficient investments in internal operations product development or expansion efforts share repurchases acquisitions cash dividend payments during turbulent periods where credit availability is unpredictable businesses with consistent cash generation and the appropriate capital structure can control their own destiny qualitative management and business assessment while comprehensive independent financial statement analysis is an integral part of our approach a thorough review cannot be completed without making judgments on our “prospective” partners – the company’s management team reaching for this confidence level makes sense for us our expectation in most situations is that we will be investors in this company for  to  years and we may also be one of the company�s largest shareholders our qualitative management review includes an evaluation of each company’s leadership compensation practices and perceived goal congruency with shareholders candor with pcm and willingness to engage with longterm shareholders history of creating or failing to create value for shareholders intellect ability innovation and focus – can this management group close the valuation gap insider ownership including recent trading activity by management and company directors perceived quality and objectivity independence of the company�s directors in the course of our qualitative business assessment we often seek input from among others industry competitors suppliers customers and other knowledgeable industry participants the objective of this review is to ensure that in addition to being statistically attractive that we also identify a durable franchise with relevant products and services and defined market segments in which the products have a niche or unique value proposition making them difficult to displace pcm�s qualitative business review seeks the following a thorough understanding of the market dynamics for the industry in which the company operates know the competitive risks from other industry operators and their potential to take market share understand management�s commitment to or answer to innovation and new product spending review sales team skill and record of success � does company�s sales team execute well consider any secular threats that may relegate this investment to �value trap� status review ownership of the stock � have activists taken positions and what might they propose where pcm identifies shortcomings or potential risks in these or other aspects of the company it will seek to analyze and account for them relative to the overall attractiveness of the opportunity we understand that manageable risk and nearterm uncertainty may underpin or contribute to a compelling valuation however we also understand that some risks are �unanalyzable� and our responsibility is to move on to the next idea time horizon  investor expectations initially when we purchase a security we expect to realize fair value in the market over a multiyear time horizon often  to  years  however actual holding periods may vary based on market and company specific factors stocks most often become available at our target discount because they are out of favor misunderstood or disdained we have to be patient as improvements can take time  our time horizon must match the opportunity we trust our research and investment thesis  even when contrary views may prevail in the shortterm we are recursive and diligent in monitoring and evaluating progress we react as needed to facts that may challenge or change our investment thesis because investments are typically out of favor or in the midst of a business change earnings volatility when we are buyers price movements can be unpredictable over the near term portfolio construction while pcm’s stock selection process is built on bottomup fundamental analysis our portfolio construction process also incorporates a broader economic perspective  our all capitalization approach allows us to pursue value wherever it is identified pcm normally maintains core position weightings of between  and  though in certain instances positions may comprise as much as  of assets  the  largest holdings may frequently exceed  of account assets pcm does not seek to track a broader market index  rather we strive to allocate capital thoughtfully and will frequently concentrate investments in areas where our research and world view identify significant opportunity sell discipline target valuations are established at the time of purchase and continually revisited to incorporate new information such as operational execution company fundamentals and corresponding valuations industry outlook and macroeconomic factors pcm reduces exposure in holdings as they approach our estimate of intrinsic value or when warranted by either an adverse change in a material aspect of the business or its operating environment the content on this site is provided as general
