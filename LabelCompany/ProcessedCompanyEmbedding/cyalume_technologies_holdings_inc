estimated using an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants that fair value is determined based on significant inputs contained in a fair value hierarchy as follows    level  quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets to which the company has access at the measurement date level  inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability   the determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement   there are three general valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value as described below   market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities prices may be indicated by pricing guides sale transactions market trades or other sources cost approach based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset replacement cost income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about the

codification “asc” topic   the new revenue recognition standard relates to revenue from contracts with customers which along with amendments issued in  and  will supersede nearly all current us gaap guidance on this topic and eliminate industryspecific guidance  the underlying principle is to use a fivestep analysis of transactions to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services the company is in the initial stages of evaluating the effect of adopting asu  on its consolidated financial statements the planned approach includes performing a detailed review of key contracts representative of the different businesses and comparing historical accounting policies and practices to the new accounting guidance the company will continue its evaluation of the standards update through the date of adoption the company plans to adopt this standard utilizing the modified retrospective approach            cyalume technologies holdings inc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements   in january  the fasb issued asu no  financial instruments – overall subtopic  “asu ” which updates certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments asu  will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of  and early adoption is not permitted the company does not expect the adoption of asu  will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu  leases   topic  “asu ” which requires companies that are lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and lease liability for most leases that do not meet the definition of a shortterm lease for income statement purposes leases will continue to be classified as either operating or financing classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting this standard will result in extensive qualitative and quantitative disclosure changes this standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period while the company is currently assessing the impact asu no  will have on its consolidated financial statements the company expects the primary impact upon adoption will be the recognition on a discounted basis of its minimum commitments under noncancellable operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations   in march  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu”  compensation stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting “asu ” the purpose of the update is to simplify several areas of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for annual reporting periods after december   including interim periods within those fiscal periods early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu no  did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations   in august  the fasb issued asu  statement of cash flows topic  – classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments “asu ” which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted the amendments in asu  should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented the company does not expect the adoption of asu  to have a material impact on its statement of cash flows   in november  the fasb issued asu  statement of cash flows topic  – restricted cash “asu ” which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with this standard amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted the company does not expect the adoption of asu  to have a material impact on its statement of cash flows and related disclosures   in january  the fasb issued asu  intangibles  goodwill and other topic  simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment “asu ” which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill asu  is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted and applied prospectively the company does not expect asu  to have a material impact on its financial statements            item    managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

revenue  in millions             change                       chemical light                  ammunition                     specialty products                      total                     during the first quarter of  chemical light and ammunition revenues were both approximately  million less than the first quarter of  specialty products revenue during the first quarter of  increased  million over the first quarter of  as a result of an increase in product sales as well as a price increase to specialty products customers   cost of goods sold for the first quarter of  increased to approximately  million from the prior year amount of approximately  million as a result of the higher revenue levels during  the gross profit margin for the first quarter of  decreased to approximately  compared to a gross profit margin of approximately  for the first quarter of  this decrease was largely attributable to a higher mix of lowermargin specialty product sales as well as manufacturing variances carried over from  which were expensed during the first quarter of       sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of  were approximately  million which was an increase of approximately  million compared to first quarter of  this increase is the result of higher commissions on the increased specialty products sales levels in addition to an increase in online marketing spend during  compared to    general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of  were approximately  million versus approximately  million for the corresponding prior year period the  million decrease was due to lower consulting fees lower legal fees and a small decrease in various other corporaterelated expenses and fees   research and development expenses of approximately  million for the first quarter of  increased slightly by approximately  million from the prior year the increase was the result of additional research and development initiatives during  as compared to             during the three months ended march   and  we recorded tax expense of approximately  million and  respectively on foreign income generated by our ctsas subsidiary the remaining income tax expense reflected for both the three months ended march   and  respectively reflects tax expense on us income generated we have a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax asset due to management’s assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of certain deferred tax assets may not be realized   material changes in financial condition – march   versus december     cash was approximately  million at march   representing a decrease of approximately  million from december   from december   to march   combined accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by approximately  million accounts receivable increased by approximately  million and inventories decreased by approximately  million   our accounts receivable increased by approximately  million at march   compared to december   due to strong first quarter revenues and the timing of customer payments our receivables are generally collected within  to  days thus revenues recorded in the day period preceding the measurement date significantly influence the reported balances    accounts payable and accrued expenses combined were approximately  million at march   versus approximately  million at december   a decrease of approximately  million payments during the first quarter of  on amounts accrued for at the end of  such as the  accrued performance bonus amounts included within accrued expenses which were paid during the first quarter of  are the primary reason for this decrease we had a decrease in accrued expenses of approximately  million and a decrease in accounts payable of approximately  million at march   compared to december   we had a balance of  million outstanding on our line of credit at march   which we use to meet temporary working capital needs we did not have a balance outstanding under our line of credit at december     liquidity and capital resources   on may   we entered into a credit agreement with monroe capital management advisors llc as administrative agent and lead arranger the “agent” and the various lenders party thereto the “monroe credit agreement” the monroe credit agreement provides for a total borrowing commitment of  million the “monroe credit facility” in the form of i a  million revolving credit facility the “monroe line of credit” ii an  million senior secured term loan the “term a loan” and iii a  million delayed draw term loan the “delayed draw loan”    on august   we entered into a first amendment the “first amendment” to the monroe credit agreement pursuant to the first amendment the monroe credit agreement was amended to among other things reduce the aggregate amount of the delayed draw loan under the credit agreement from  million to  million on august   the full amount of the delayed draw loan was funded to us  million of which was used to make a payment in connection with a legal settlement agreement and the remaining  of which was paid to the agent as a deferred closing fee the first amendment also modified for certain periods during the term of the credit agreement i the maximum senior debt to ebitda ratio that the company is required to maintain and ii the applicable limits on the company’s aggregate permitted capital expenditures pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement   under the terms of the monroe credit agreement the company is able to borrow under the monroe line of credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of i  million and ii the sum of  of all eligible accounts receivable plus  of all eligible inventory additionally while the loans are outstanding we must maintain a a fixed charge coverage ratio of  to  b a senior debt to ebitda ratio initially of  to  decreasing to  to  over the term of the loans and c a twelve month trailing ebitda measured quarterly with the amounts ranging from  increasing up to  million over the term of the loans   the term a loan provides for quarterly amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter commencing on june   in an aggregate principal amount equal to  increasing to  on june   and increasing to  on june   with the balance payable on the termination date of may   the “termination date” the delayed draw loan provides for quarterly amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter in an aggregate principal amount equal to  of the original principal amount of the delayed draw loan increasing to  on march   and increasing to  on march   with the balance payable on the termination date the monroe line of credit is payable on the termination date            as of march   and december   we had approximately  million and  million respectively of cash on hand the major sources and uses of cash during  were all in the normal course of business our availability under the monroe line of credit was approximately  million at march   and approximately  million at december     capital expenditures and payments for intangibles were approximately  million for the three months ended march   we expect to fund capital expenditures for the remainder of  from existing cash and operating cash flows   we were in compliance with our financial covenants relating to our loans as of march   we expect to meet our financial covenants for  and we also expect that cash provided by the business will be adequate to meet our planned needs during    pursuant to the terms of the monroe credit agreement we plan to make an excess cash payment of approximately  million on or before may   which will reduce the principal of our term a loan and our delayed draw loan the excess cash payment is calculated based on the definition of excess cash flow under the monroe credit agreement and is related to favorable financial performance primarily relating to cash flow generation   we did not pay a dividend in  and we do not have plans to pay a common dividend in the future we are accruing dividends in connection with the series a convertible preferred stock issued on november   and the series c preferred stock issued on july     critical accounting policies   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as reserves for inventory accounts receivable and deferred tax assets assessing the carrying value of intangible assets including goodwill determining the useful lives of property plant and equipment and intangible assets determining asset retirement obligations and determining the fair value of contingent consideration estimates are based on historical experience where applicable and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates actual results may differ   revenue recognition   revenue from the sale of products or the providing of services is recognized when the earnings process is complete the amount of recognizable revenue can be determined the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured depending on the terms of the individual sales arrangement with our customer product sales are recognized at either the shipping point or upon receipt by the customer costs and related expenses to manufacture the products are recorded as costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized additionally if the right of return is granted to the buyer in a product sale revenue is deferred until enough historical customer data is available to reasonably estimate returns and related costs    we have two significant contracts providing for the sale of indefinite quantities of products at fixed per unit prices subject to adjustment for certain economic factors revenue under these contracts is recognized when products ordered under the contracts are received by the customer whenever costs change we review the pricing under these contracts to determine whether they require the sale of products at a loss to date we have no loss contracts which would require the accrual of future losses in the current financial statements   we also provide research and development services for customers for which we earn payments that are contingent upon achieving a specific result “milestones” upon achieving such milestones revenue is recognized provided the payment is i related to past performance ii reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement with our customer and iii nonrefundable   warrants liability   we use fair values as determined by significant unobservable inputs these estimated values are significant inputs into the black scholes pricing model used to calculate the estimated fair value of warrants potentially settleable in cash which are recorded as warrants liability the estimated fair value of the common warrants are determined at each balance sheet date and the change in the estimated fair value of the warrants is reflected within our statements of comprehensive income             income taxes   deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are recognized when based upon available evidence realization of the assets is more likely than not   in assessing the realization of longterm deferred income tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized the realization of deferred income tax assets depends upon future taxable income in years before net operating loss carryforwards expire we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets on a quarterly basis if we determine that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be recovered we establish a valuation allowance against some or all deferred income tax assets   when tax returns are filed it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement  with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above if such a position existed would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination there were no such positions as of march   or december     we classify interest on tax deficiencies as interest expense and income tax penalties as other expense     in september  the irs completed an audit of our tax return for the year  there were no adjustments to our  tax return our tax returns filed for the  and  years are still open for audit the tax return for  was filed on september   under a filing extension the tax return for  is expected to be filed under a filing extension prior to september     goodwill   goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and accordingly is not subject to amortization goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review and if conditions warrant interim impairment reviews impairment charges if any are recorded in the period in which the impairment is determined   our business is managed and financial results are reported as one segment the company’s one operating segment consists of three reporting units chemical light the operations of cti cts and ctsas specialty products the operations of csp and other the parent company cyalume technologies holdings inc   we perform the traditional twostep process for assessing goodwill for impairment the first step of the twostep process requires a comparison of our estimated fair value for each reporting unit versus our carrying book value if our carrying value exceeded our fair value further analysis step  of the twostep process is required to determine the amount if any that our goodwill was impaired to determine the amount of fair value we used a discounted cash flow analysis   intangible assets   intangible assets include developed technologies and patents customer relationships customer backlog noncompete agreements and certain trade names which are amortized over their estimated useful lives and other trademarks and trade names which are considered to have indefinite useful lives and therefore are not amortized the carrying amounts of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that those carrying amounts may not be recoverable additionally the carrying amounts of nonamortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually every august  costs incurred to register new patents or defend existing patents are capitalized while costs to renew or extend the term of intangible assets are expensed when incurred   inventories   inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout “fifo” method or net realizable value we periodically review the realizability of inventory provisions are recorded for potential obsolescence which requires management’s judgment conditions impacting the realizability of inventory could cause actual writeoffs to be materially different than provisions for obsolescence   foreign operations and currency   accounts of our foreign subsidiary are recorded using their local currency the euro as the functional currency for consolidation revenues and expenses are converted to us dollars using the average exchange rate for the month in which they were recorded assets and liabilities are converted to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date equity transactions are converted to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect as of the date of the transaction translation gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss gains and losses resulting from transactions which are denominated in other than the functional currencies are reported as other income net in the statement of comprehensive income in the period the gain or loss occurred            recent accounting pronouncements   the following are recent accounting pronouncements that have affected our consolidated financial statements or may affect them in the future   in may  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no  revenue from contracts with customers  as a new topic accounting standards codification “asc” topic   the new revenue recognition standard relates to revenue from contracts with customers which along with amendments issued in  and  will supersede nearly all current us gaap guidance on this topic and eliminate industryspecific guidance  the underlying principle is to use a fivestep analysis of transactions to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services the company is in the initial stages of evaluating the effect of adopting asu  on its consolidated financial statements the planned approach includes performing a detailed review of key contracts representative of the different businesses and comparing historical accounting policies and practices to the new accounting guidance the company will continue its evaluation of the standards update through the date of adoption the company plans to adopt this standard utilizing the modified retrospective approach      in january  the fasb issued asu no  financial instruments – overall subtopic  “asu ” which updates certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments asu  will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of  and early adoption is not permitted the company does not expect the adoption of asu  will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu  leases   topic  “asu ” which requires companies that are lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and lease liability for most leases that do not meet the definition of a shortterm lease for income statement purposes leases will continue to be classified as either operating or financing classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting this standard will result in extensive qualitative and quantitative disclosure changes this standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period while the company is currently assessing the impact asu no  will have on its consolidated financial statements the company expects the primary impact upon adoption will be the recognition on a discounted basis of its minimum commitments under noncancellable operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations   in march  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu”  compensation stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting “asu ” the purpose of the update is to simplify several areas of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for annual reporting periods after december   including interim periods within those fiscal periods early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu  did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations   in august  the fasb issued asu  statement of cash flows topic  – classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments “asu ” which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted the amendments in asu  should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented the company does not expect the adoption of asu  to have a material impact on its statement of cash flows   in november  the fasb issued asu  statement of cash flows topic  – restricted cash “asu ” which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with this standard amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted the company does not expect the adoption of asu  to have a material impact on its statement of cash flows and related disclosures   in january  the fasb issued asu  intangibles  goodwill and other topic  simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment “asu ” which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill asu  is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted and applied prospectively we do not expect asu  to have a material impact to our financial statements            item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   as a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide information typically
