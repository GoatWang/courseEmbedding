market fund some money market securities have demand or put features which have the effect of shortening the securitys maturity money market securities include bank certificates of deposit bankers

principal investment risks many factors affect each funds performance a funds yield will change daily based on changes in interest rates and other market conditions although each fund is managed to maintain a stable  share price there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to do so for example a major increase in interest rates or a decreaser in the credit quality of the issuer of one of a funds investments could cause the funds share price to decrease it is important to note that neither the funds share prices norr their yields are guaranteed by the us government the following factors can significantly affect a funds performance interest rate changes money market securities have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates in general the price of a money market security can fall when interest rates rise and can rise when interest rates fall securities with longer maturities and the securities of issuers in the financial services sector can be more sensitive to interest rate changes shortterm securities tend to react to changes in shortterm interest rates foreign exposure issuers located in foreign countries and entities providing credit support or a maturityshortening structure that are located in foreign countries can involve increased risks extensive public information about the issuer or provider may not be available and unfavorable political economic or governmental developments could affect the value of the security financial services exposure financial services companies are highly dependent on the supply of shortterm financing the value of securities of issuers in the financial services sector can be sensitive to changes in government regulation and interest rates and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad issuerspecific changes changes in the financial condition of an issuer changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of issuer and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect the credit quality or value of an issuers securities entities providing credit support or a maturityshortening structure also can be affected by these types of changes

program only as a borrower a fund will borrow through the program only when the costs are equal to or lower than the costs of bank loans and will lend through the program only when the returns are higher than those available from an investment in repurchase agreements interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on

opportunity or additional borrowing costs money market securities are highquality shortterm obligations money market securities may be structured to be or may employ a trust or other form so that they are eligible investments for money market funds for example put features can be used to modify the maturity of a security or interest rate adjustment features can be used to enhance price stability if a structure fails to function as intended adverse tax or investment consequences may result neither the internal revenue service irs nor any other regulatory authority has ruled definitively on certain legal issues presented by certain structured securities future tax or other regulatory determinations could adversely affect the value liquidity or tax treatment of the income received from

put features entitle the holder to sell a security back to the issuer or a third party at any time or at specified intervals in exchange for this benefit a fund may accept a lower interest rate securities with put features are subject to the risk that the put provider is unable to honor the put feature purchase the security put providers often support their ability to buy securities on demand by obtaining letters of credit or other guarantees from other entities demand features standby commitments and tender options are types of put features repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreedupon price the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreedupon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security as protection against the risk that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation the securities are held in a separate account at a bank markedtomarket daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount the value of the security purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security in addition delays or losses could result if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent the funds will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmr restricted securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to a fund restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  rthe  actr or in a registered public offering where registration is required the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop the holder might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a security to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreedupon price and time the funds will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmr such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and a funds yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage short sales against the box are short sales of securities that a fund owns or has the right to obtain equivalent in kind or amount to the securities sold short short sales against the box could be used to protect the net asset value per share nav of the fund in anticipation of increased interest rates without sacrificing the current yield of the securities sold short if a fund enters into a short sale against the box it will be required to set aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities and will be required to hold such securities while the short sale is outstanding the fund will incur transaction costs in connection with opening and closing short sales against the box sources of liquidity or credit support issuers may employ various forms of credit and liquidity enhancements including letters of credit guarantees puts and demand features and insurance provided by domestic or foreign entities such as banks and other financial institutions fmr may rely on its evaluation of the credit of the liquidity or credit enhancement provider in determining whether to purchase a security supported by such enhancement in evaluating the credit of a foreign bank or other foreign entities fmr will consider whether adequate public information about the entity is available and whether the entity may be subject to unfavorable political or economic developments currency controls or other government restrictions that might affect its ability to honor its commitment changes in the credit quality of the entity providing the enhancement could affect the value of the security or a funds share price stripped securities are the separate income or principal components of a debt security the risks associated with stripped securities are similar to those of other money market securities although stripped securities may be more volatile us treasury securities that have been stripped by a federal reserve bank are obligations issued by the us treasury privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer deposits a us treasury security or other us government security with a custodian for safekeeping the custodian issues separate receipts for the coupon payments and the principal payment which the dealer then sells because the sec does not consider privately stripped government securities to be us government securities for purposes of rule a a fund must evaluate them as it would nongovernment securities pursuant to regulatory guidelines applicable to money market funds variable and floating rate securities provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the security variable rate securities provide for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate while floating rate securities have interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a designated benchmark rate or the issuers credit quality some variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries whenissued and forward purchase or sale transactions involve a commitment to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement period for that type of security typically no interest accrues to the purchaser until the security is delivered when purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions the purchaser assumes the rights and risks of ownership including the risks of price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security will not be issued as anticipated because payment for the securities is not required until the delivery date these risks are in addition to the risks associated with a funds investments if a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a purchase is outstanding the purchases may result in a form of leverage when a fund has sold a security pursuant to one of these transactions the fund does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security if the other party to a delayeddelivery transaction fails to deliver or pay for the securities a fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or suffer a loss a fund may renegotiate a whenissued or forward transaction and may sell the underlying securities before delivery which may result in capital gains or losses for the fund portfolio transactions all orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of each fund by fmr pursuant to authority contained in the

that subadviser is authorized to provide the services described in the subadvisory agreement and will do so in accordance with the policies described in this section purchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are effected through brokers who charge a commission for their services securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees ordinarily commissions are not charged on overthecounter otc orders because a fund pays a spread which is included in the cost of the security and is the difference between the dealers cost and the cost to the fund when a fund executes an otc order with an electronic communications network an alternative trading system or a nonmarket maker a commission is charged because there is no spread on the trade each fund may execute portfolio transactions with brokers or dealers that provide products and services these products and services may include economic industry or company research reports or investment recommendations subscriptions to financial publications or research data compilations compilations of securities prices earnings dividends and similar data computerized databases quotation equipment and services research or analytical computer software and services products or services that assist in effecting transactions including services of thirdparty computer systems developers directly related to research and brokerage activities and effecting securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto such as clearance and settlement the receipt of these products and services has not reduced fmrs normal research activities in providing investment advice to the funds fmrs expenses could be increased however if it attempted to generate these additional products and services through its own efforts certain of the products and services fmr receives from brokers or dealers are furnished by brokers or dealers on their own initiative either in connection with a particular transaction or as part of their overall services in addition fmr may request a broker or dealer to provide a specific proprietary or thirdparty product or service while fmr takes into account the products and services provided by a broker or dealer in determining whether commissions are reasonable neither fmr nor a fund incurs an obligation to the broker dealer or third party to pay for any product or service or portion thereof by generating a certain amount of commissions or otherwise brokers or dealers that execute transactions for ar fund may receive commissionsr that are in excess of the amount of commissions that other brokers or dealers might have charged in recognition of the products and services they have provided before causing a fund to pay such higher commissions fmr will make a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the products and services provided viewed in terms of the particular transaction for the fund or fmrs overall responsibilities to the fund or other investment companies and investment accounts typically these products and services assist fmr or its affiliates in terms of its overall investment responsibilities to the fund and other investment companies and investment accounts however each product or service received may not benefit the fund fmr is authorized to allocate portfolio transactions in a manner that takes into account assistance received in the distribution of shares of the funds or other fidelity funds and to use the research services of brokerage and other firms that have provided such assistance fmr may place trades with certain brokers with which it is under common control including national financial services llc nfs and fidelity brokerage services japan llc fbsj provided it determines that these affiliates products services and costs are comparable to those of nonaffiliated qualified brokerage firms fmr may also place trades with redibook ecn llc redibookr and archipelago ecn archipelago electronic communication networks ecnsr in which a whollyowned subsidiary of fmr corp has an equity ownership interest if the commissions are fair reasonable and comparable to commissions charged by nonaffiliated qualified brokerage firms for similar services fmr may allocate brokerage transactions to brokers or dealers including affiliates of fmr who have entered into arrangements with fmr under which the brokerdealer allocates a portion of the commissions paid by a fund toward the reduction of that funds expenses the transaction quality must however be comparable to that of other qualified brokerdealers the trustees of each fund periodically review fmrs performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by the fund over representative periods of time to determine if they are reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund a fund may pay both commissions and spreads in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions for the fiscal years ended april    and  each fund paid no brokerage commissions for the fiscal year ended april   each fund paid no brokerage commissions to firms for providing research services the trustees of each fund have approved procedures in conformity with rule f under the  act whereby a fund may purchase securities that are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of fmr participates these procedures prohibit the funds from directly or indirectly benefiting an fmr affiliate in connection with such underwritings in addition for underwritings where an fmr affiliate participates as a principal underwriter certain restrictions may apply that could among other things limit the amount of securities that the funds could purchase in the underwritings from time to time the trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the funds of some portion of the brokerage commissions or similar fees paid by the funds on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable each fund seeks to recapture soliciting brokerdealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities but at present no other recapture arrangements are in effect the trustees intend to continue to review whether recapture opportunities are available and are legally permissible and if so to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be advisable for each fund to seek such recapture although the trustees and officers of each fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by fmr or its affiliates investment decisions for each fund are made independently from those of other funds or investment accounts rincluding proprietary accountsr managed by fmr or its affiliates the same security is often held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment objective of more than one fund or investment account when two or more funds ror investment accountsr are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable rtor each fund in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as each fund is concerned in other cases however the ability of the funds to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the funds it is the current opinion of the trustees that the desirability of retaining fmr as investment adviser to each fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous transactions valuation each funds nav is the value of a single share the nav of each fund is computed by adding the value of the funds investments cash and other assets subtracting its liabilities and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding portfolio securities and other assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost this technique involves initially valuing an instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its current market value the amortized cost value of an instrument may be higher or lower than the price a fund would receive if it sold the instrument securities of other openend investment companies are valued at their respective navs at such intervals as they deem appropriate the trustees consider the extent to which nav calculated by using market valuations would deviate from the  per share calculated using amortized cost valuation if the trustees believe that a deviation from a funds amortized cost per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders the trustees have agreed to take such corrective action if any as they deem appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent reasonably practicable the dilution or unfair results such corrective action could include selling portfolio instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity withholding dividends redeeming shares in kind establishing nav by using available market quotations and such other measures as the trustees may deem appropriate performance a fund may quote performance in various ways all performance information supplied by the funds in advertising is historical and is not intended to indicate future returns each funds yield and return fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors yield calculations to compute the yield for a fund for a period the net change in value of a hypothetical investment in one share reflects the value of additional shares purchased with dividends from the one original share and dividends declared on both the original share and any additional shares the net change is then divided by the value of the investment at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return this base period return is annualized to obtain a current annualized yield a fund also may calculate an effective yield by compounding the base period return over a oneyear period in addition to the current yield a fund may quote yields in advertising based on any historical sevenday period yields for a fund are calculated on the same basis as other money market funds as required by applicable regulation yield information may be useful in reviewing a funds performance and in providing a basis for comparison with other investment alternatives however a funds yield fluctuates unlike investments that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated period of time when comparing investment alternatives investors should also note the quality and maturity of the portfolio securities of respective investment companies they have chosen to consider investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates a funds yield will tend to be somewhat higher than prevailing market rates and in periods of rising interest rates a funds yield will tend to be somewhat lower also when interest rates are falling the inflow of net new money to a fund from the continuous sale of its shares will likely be invested in instruments producing lower yields than the balance of the funds holdings thereby reducing a funds current yield in periods of rising interest rates the opposite can be expected to occur return calculations returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of a funds return including the effect of reinvesting dividends and capital gain distributions and any change in a funds nav over a stated period a cumulative return reflects actual performance over a stated period of time average annual returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in a fund over a stated period and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had been constant over the period for example a cumulative return of  over ten years would produce an average annual return of  which is the steady annual rate of return that would equal  growth on a compounded basis in ten years while average annual returns are a convenient means of comparing investment alternatives investors should realize that a funds performance is not constant over time but changes from year to year and that average annual returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the actual yeartoyear performance of a fund rin addition to average annual returns a fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment over a stated period average annual and cumulative returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount and may be calculated for a single investment a series of investments or a series of redemptions over any time period returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital including capital gains and changes in share price to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to return returns may or may not include the effect of a funds small balance maintenance fee or the effect of a funds closeout fee excluding a funds small balance maintenance fee or fund closeout fee from a return calculation produces a higher return

lipper rankings are based on return assume reinvestment of distributions do not take sales charges or trading fees into consideration and are prepared without regard to tax consequences lipper may also rank based on yield in addition to the mutual fund rankings a funds performance may be compared to stock bond and money market mutual fund performance indexes prepared by lipper or other organizations when comparing these indexes it is important to remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment for example while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility likewise money market funds may offer greater stability of principal but generally do not offer the higher potential returns available from stock mutual funds from time to time a funds performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and periodicals for example a fund may quote morningstar inc in its advertising materials morningstar inc is a mutual fund rating service that rates mutual funds on the basis of riskadjusted performance rankings that compare the performance of fidelity funds to one another in appropriate categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising a fund may be compared in advertising to certificates of deposit cds or other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects for example a fund may offer greater liquidity or higher potential returns than cds a fund does not guarantee an investors principal or return and fund shares are not fdic insured fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals understand

market fund and spartan money market fund are funds of fidelity hereford street trust an openend management investment company organized as a delaware business trust on november   currently there are three funds in fidelity hereford street trust spartan us treasury money market fund spartan us government money market fund and spartan money market fund the trustees are permitted to create additional funds in the trust and to create additional classes of the funds the assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income earnings profits and proceeds thereof subject to the rights of creditors are allocated to such fund and constitute the underlying assets of such fund the underlying assets of each fund in the trust shall be charged with the liabilities and expenses attributable to such fund any general expenses of the trust shall be allocated between or among any one or more of the funds shareholder liability the trust is a business trust organized under delaware law delaware law provides that shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitations of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit the courts of some states however may decline to apply delaware law on this point the trust instrument contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts liabilities obligations and expenses of the trust the trust instrument provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of shares and requires that each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the trustees relating to the trust or to a fund shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or to one or more funds and its or their assets the trust instrument further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund the trust instrument provides for indemnification out of each funds property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason the trust instrument also provides that each fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which delaware law does not apply no contractual limitation of liability was in effect and a fund is unable to meet its obligations fmr believes that in view of the above

order permits the funds to participate in a credit facility administered by fmr the “ifl program” the ifl program enables the funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels the ifl program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the funds and enhance the lending funds ability to earn higher rates of interest of

the funds “benchmark rate” the board of trustees each a “fund board” and collectively the “fund boards” of each fund including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent trustees” establishes the benchmark rate and reviews no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate the benchmark rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the federal funds rate over the previous  days  applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary therefore applicants seek to amend the prior order to eliminate the use of the otd rate in the ifl rate calculation provided in conditions  and  “rate conditions” applicants also request an exemption from section a of the act applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person directly or indirectly if that person controls or is under common control with that company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds applicants state that each fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other funds and therefore an affiliated person of those funds  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  section f of the act prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank if immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting an exemption from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting an exemption from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements the requested order would amend the rate conditions in the prior order and grant applicants an exemption from section a of the act  as noted previously applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary applicants state further that the ifl rate as amended would make it more likely that lending funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the ifl program if the ifl rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate applicants state that the rate conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity  applicants also state that the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions will not involve any potential that one fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another fund applicants state that under the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions rates will be set under a preestablished formula approved by the fund boards applicants state that all funds participating in the ifl program as revised by the rate conditions on any given day will receive the same interest rate  applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the rate conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the act and meet the standards set forth in sections c dj b and d of the act and rule d under the act applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the rate conditions would be reasonable and fair would not involve overreaching and would be consistent with the investment policies of the funds and with the general purposes of the act applicants submit further that each funds participation in the ifl program would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be on a basis which is no different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant applicants
