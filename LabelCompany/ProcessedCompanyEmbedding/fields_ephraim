compensation at edgewater technology inc  questions what ceo has accomplished to deserve  increase in minimum base salary notes compensation of top four executives in  was almost x companys total net income asks if board of directors will also be receiving pay increases asks if all edgw employees will be receiving significant pay increases or just senior management questions why k was filed late on a friday two days after agreements were signed questions justification for increased severance and change of control packages dec    et from ephraim fields new york dec   prnewswire  mr ephraim fields of echo lake capital today announced he had issued the following letter to the board of directors of edgewater technology inc edgw december   to shirley singleton paul flynn  paul guzzi nancy leaming michael loeb daniel oconnell wayne wilson it appears to us that christmas once again came early and undeservedly for the senior management of edgewater technology inc edgw as a recent k filing indicates you approved significant compensation increases for them your decision to continually provide increased compensation for people whom we believe have repeatedly underperformed based on both qualitative and quantitative measures raises serious questions about both your motivations and willingness to uphold your fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of all shareholders  furthermore we believe your decision to file the k late in the day on a friday two days after signing the agreements raises questions about the level of transparency the company is providing its stakeholders  if the agreements were approved on december th why was the k not filed until late in the day on friday december th  since it does not typically take the company that long to file an k we wonder if you were attempting to bury the filing and minimize attention it would receive from edgws various stakeholders we remain concerned that there is an inappropriately cozy relationship at edgw whereby board members whom as we have discussed in our previous letters we believe are overpaid lack appropriate skills and lack appropriate incentives continue to enrich senior management including the chairman of the board and in exchange the board members themselves are also rewarded with increasingly generous compensation  while such a relationship might be great for you and senior management it sadly comes at the expense of edgws nonmanagement shareholders after reading the k we have some questions which we believe would be of interest to edgws various stakeholders   considering ms singleton mr clancey ms ranzalknowles and mr oakes collectively made  million in  the last year for which such data is available which was almost x the companys net income for that year do you really believe these individuals deserve even more compensation what exactly has ms singleton accomplished to deserve a contract extension and a  increase in her minimum annual base salary for   do you feel she has management skills technological insights or other attributes that cannot be provided by other less expensive ceos  you can clearly see how edgws stock has repeatedly underperformed over the past  years under her leadership so why do you continue to retain her services  on a related note have you ever conducted any confidential internal research to determine how ms singleton is viewed by edgws employees  you can probably guess what our research has concluded now that you have granted senior management significant pay increases for  will you the board of directors also be receiving pay increases  now that you have granted ms singleton and mr clancey increases in their minimum annual base salary for  of  and  respectively can all edgw employees expect similar pay increases what is your justification for approving even more generous change of control packages  clearly a potential result of this is to further enrich senior management while harming shareholders by reducing the price a potential acquirer would pay for edgws shares the k included other compensation increases which we also find distasteful and not in the best interests of edgws shareholders  if you believe you can continue to cover over both your and senior managements longstanding poor performance by burying k filings and by issuing irrelevant and selfserving press releases we strongly suggest  you refocus your efforts and begin to take steps that are truly in the best interests of all the shareholders sincerely ephraim fields contact ephraim fields at   source ephraim fields view table fullscreen view
