noteworthy research social thinking was originally developed as an intervention and assessment framework dedicated to tackling the complex social emotional learning needs of individuals with social learning challenges at its inception  years ago there were relatively few treatmentbased research studies available to guide interventionists in how to teach individuals about their own social learning process this relative lack of treatment research while not as bleak today continues to be limited the underlying motivation for the creation of the social thinking methodology was and is that individuals with social learning issues should have access to interventions and strategies based on both individual learning abilities and the demands of the community within which they participate thinking socially teaching social knowledge to foster social behavioral change pamela j crooke michelle garcia winner and lesley b olswang this article discusses the social emotional chain reaction as taught in social behavior mapping the idea that how we act affects how others feel how we make others feel affects how they treat us how we are treated affects how we feel about others and ultimately how we feel about ourselves the social emotional chain reaction is at the foundation of social interaction and is at the heart of what we teach through the social thinking methodology read more

social detective are thoroughly taught to the student   the superflex curriculum book offers clear lesson plans to help educators slps other therapists and parents create a personalized superflex superhero training academy for their students students learn they each have a superflex superflexible thinking superhero inside their brains superflex helps them take on the team of unthinkables rock brain topic twister meister mean jean and glassman to name a few cartoonlike characters who embody different behaviors and challenges for instance rock brain makes people get stuck on their own ideas or glassman makes them have huge upset reactions each of the  characters’ powers are described and teaching materials include specific strategies that can help students subdue the unthinkable that is invading their brain you can even print cards superflex award badges and handouts included in the curriculum   the superflex comic book the superflex curriculum package includes a colorfully illustrated page storybook superflex takes on rock brain and the team of unthinkables this book tells the story of how superflex came to be the children enter superflexs town social town and learn about the cast of sneaky unthinkables who are trying to overtake and rid the town of superflex forever superflex and his sidekick dog bark go on their first mission to try to save the citizens of social town why this curriculum has been so successful children with hfa aspergers adhd and other social emotional learning challenges have difficulty regulating their own behaviors in the moment superflex provides a fun forum in which they can explore their challenges and identify ways to modify their thoughts and related behaviors in different settings depicting behaviors as comic book characters helps students learn about their own behaviors in a nonthreatening way  while the superhero superflex helps build the thinking required to regulate those behaviors superflex empowers and motivates students to help themselvesreducing meltdowns and anxiety as the students discover and develop their own inner superhero   good social skills can be defined as considering other people and adapting efficiently in each context to do this we have to read the hidden social rules in each social situation and then regulate our physical presence eyes language emotions and reactions   this requires highly flexible thinking while some children learn to do this somewhat effortlessly many students even advanced socalled normalthinking students have challenges in recognizing and applying these concepts that are at the heart of social cooperation and social problem solving social smarts only occur when students incorporate all this information and regulate their bodies and minds to show they can effectively adapt to others across environmental contexts    students who do not learn this information intuitively but who function with emerging languagethinking skills need to be taught these core concepts more explicitly superflex and the team of unthinkables help students understand and become more aware of their own thinking and behaviors when they are using their  social smarts versus when their brains are getting sidetracked in less positive and social ways the different unthinkables help them zoom in on what challenge they may be facing in the moment and the strategies help them learn to overcome that unthinkable’s powers kids enjoy being superheroes in training flexing and building their social thinking and social skills   how is superflex taught superflex was designed to be used only after students have been introduced to the social thinking concepts included in our children’s book you are a social detective and they have worked through related activities from our book think social a social thinking curriculum for school age students winner  this gives our learners a good foundation in being a social thinker and social detective so they get the most out of using superflex   the superflex curriculum book is to be read in smaller sections to students it will take several days of reading  minutes at a time or so depending on the level of social thinking and social learning challenges in your students    we introduce the concepts of superflex and the team of unthinkables through a series of lessons we start by talking about how the brain works how social information is part of the brain how we can change our behavior what our brain is expected to do socially superflex and then the thoughts that challenge our brains from
