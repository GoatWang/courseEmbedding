national association of securities dealers nasd is a securities industry selfregulatory organization that is subject to commission supervision the nasd develops rules and regulations conducts regulatory reviews of its members business activities disciplines violators and designs operates and regulates securities markets for the ultimate benefit and protection of investors nasd members agree to comply with the federal securities laws and regulations andwith the rules of the nasd and its subsidiaries as nasd members datek securities and heartland were subject to this agreement  the nasdaq stock market inc nasdaq operates and maintains systems services and products for the nasdaq stock market the nasdaq stock market is the largest electronic screenbased market in the world nasdaq enables securities firms to execute transactions for investors from wherever they are located by use of advanced computer and telecommunications technologies nasdaq is distinguished from floorbased exchanges by its use of multiple market makers which are independent dealers who openly compete with one another for investor orders in each nasdaq security  the nasd established the small order execution system soes in  soes was an automated trading system intended to benefit small investors by providing immediate execution of small orders entered into the nasdaq system at the best available price during the relevant period soes was the only nasdaq trading system that allowed for automatic execution and it offered faster execution than any other system in  nasdaq made participation in soes mandatory for all market makers in nasdaq national market securities  there were several restrictions on the use of the soes system under nasd rules only individual retail customers were permitted to use the soes system and brokerdealers were prohibited from using soes to trade for their own accounts nasd rules also set a maximum order size for soes trades the maximum order size was  shares in   shares in  and  shares in  nasd rules prohibited the division of orders in excess of the maximum order size into smaller parts for purposes of complying with the maximum order size requirement  brokerdealers registered to place trades on the soes system were known as soes order entry firms soes order entry firms were required to register with the nasd by executing an application and agreement for small order execution system application by submitting an application a soes participant agreed to comply strictly with the rules governing the use of the soes system and was on notice that violations would subject them to censure fine suspension revocation of its registration as a soes order entry firm or any other appropriate penalty under nasd rules  once registered as a soes order entry firm an entity could enter the soes system to execute trades by simply identifying itself as an order entry firm each system entry constituted a representation by the order entry firm that it was complying with all soes rules including the rules prohibiting proprietary trading  broker dealers could also register as a soes correspondent firm which were trading firms that submitted orders to order entry firms for transmission to the soes system similar to soes order entry firms soes correspondent firms also signed agreements with the nasd containing an obligation to abide by soes rules  by virtue of the soes rules the soes registration process and the terms imposed on soes participants the identity of the purchaser as a public customer in soes transactions was a material fact defendants knowledge of soes rules  datek securities first registered as a soes order entry firm on august   by registering as a soes order entry firm datek securities represented to the nasd and other soes participants that they would comply with the rules governing the soes system including the rules prohibiting proprietary trading  heartland registered as a soes correspondent firm on march   in anapplication signed by elbogen by registering as a soes correspondent firm heartland represented to the nasd and other soes participants that it would comply with the rules governing the soes system including the rules prohibiting proprietary trading  beyond those representations certain defendants and datek securities were also aware of nasd rules governing soes because of their involvement in a nasd disciplinary proceeding in  sheldon maschler citron elbogen datek securities and other individuals associated with datek securities were the subject of an administrative complaint by the nasd for violating soes rules between november  and february  the action settled on or about december   pursuant to the settlement sheldon maschler citron elbogen and datek securities were censured and fined maschler  citron  elbogen  datek securities  in addition maschler was suspended from association with any nasd member for one year and citron was suspended for  days  citron kept abreast of proposed nasd rule changes affecting soes he coordinated datek securities responses to such changes and asked traders to prepare comment letters to send to the nasd and the commission the watcher system  in the early s a daytrading software known as watcher was developed for datek securities watcher was designed to run nasdaq data through datek securities computers which were far faster than the traditional nasdaq workstations ii the watcher system gave datek securities traders a significant time advantage because they received lastsale and quotationupdate information before other market participants the watcher system also analyzed the data to highlight trading opportunities such features enabled datek securities traders to react more quickly to market activity and to have their orders executed faster than other market participants while other means of executing securities transactions with nasdaq market makers were available namely the telephone or selectnet  only soes offered automatic execution increasing the timing advantage offered by watcher  watchers superior technology combined with the soes systems automatic execution to give datek securities traders a significant advantage that advantage however was limited by soes rules soes could not be used for proprietary trading and there were limits on the number of shares per trade to maximize profitability and comply with the soes rules datek securities traders would have had to execute a large number of trades in accounts held by numerous individual retail customers consequently datek securities would only have collected commissions on such trades  instead of using the soes system for its intended and lawful purpose  to place small orders for the accounts of customers  datek securities and later heartland under the direction of defendants sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler used the system to execute millions of unlawful proprietary trades those defendants recognized that they could maximize profits from watcher by using it to trade for proprietary accounts on a massive scale using the nasdaq system that offered the fastest execution the soes system datek securities trading operations  from  to march  datek securities daytrading operation the profit center for the entire firm was headquartered at  broad street in manhattan citron and sheldon maschler managed and directed datek securities manhattan office and made all significant decisions including recruiting and hiring employee compensation structure and trading strategies mccarty played a central role in the administrative operations and daytoday oversight of the officeand by  was recognized by traders and employees as the branch manager erik maschler as head trader directly supervised the traders during the relevant period elbogen zelcer and beginning in june  erik maschler were identified to the public as the senior officers of datek securities with attendant responsibilities including keeping accurate books and records and fulfilling reporting obligations nevertheless elbogen and zelcer permitted sheldon maschler and citron the undisclosed control persons  to operate the manhattan office as they wished without proper oversight or supervision  from  to late  datek securities increased the size of its daytrading operation from    traders to nearly  traders citron was a control person in the recruitment and hiring of traders for datek securities manhattan branch and many of the recruits were friends and family of existing traders most new traders were hired directly from college possessed little or no securities industry experience and received no formal training once they joined datek securities rather for a brief period of time usually one to four weeks they observed a more experienced trader often erik maschler who would teach them how to use watcher after this training and often before they had registered with the nasd new traders were given  to  with which to trade and that amount was programmed into each new traders watcher terminal based on performance citron or erik maschler could increase a traders preset trading limit to  million or more  in addition to unregistered traders many of datek securities supervisors failed to complete the nasd examinations required to act as supervisors during  and  a group of experienced traders exercised undisclosed supervisory authority at datek securities they trained and supervised other traders and some attended management meetings these supervisors also received a percentage of the trading profits earned by their trainees  datek securities manhattan office was spartan the trading floor consisted of rows of computers and folding tables traders watched their computer terminals and punched computer keys for hours on end entering orders into the watcher system in theory traders earned  to  percent of the trading profits they generated for datek securities but in practice datek securities retained half of those promised profits the proprietary trading scheme at datek securities  in a scheme devised and implemented by defendants sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler datek securities executed millions of unlawful proprietary trades on the soes system from  through march  datek securities executed approximately  million soes trades over  percent of all soes trades in placing those trades datek securities falsely represented that such transactions were on behalf of public customers in accordance with soes rules defendants sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler concealed their unlawful use of the soes system by allocating trades to nominee accounts cross trading with datek securities proprietary account creating false books and records and filing false reports with the commission  later from april  through june  defendants sheldon maschler mccarty and erik maschler continued the proprietary trading scheme at heartland during that time period heartland executed millions of proprietary soes trades in placing trades on the soes system heartland falsely represented that those transactions were on behalf of public customers in accordance with soes rules the proprietary trading scheme at heartland was concealed from regulators using methods and procedures similar to those used at datek securities  as described below through defendant raft the aforementioned defendants funded numerous nominee accounts at datek securities and heartland through which the illegal trading scheme could be conducted by using raft the defendants were able to hide the funneling of illegal trading profits back into datek securities and heartland allocation of trades to nominee accounts  at the direction of defendants sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler datek securities used numerous nominee accounts to hide its proprietary trading dozens of individuals were recruited to open accounts at datek securities many of the nominees were friends and family members of sheldon maschler or citron in many cases personally solicited by maschler or citron to open accounts sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler also directed the firms employees to enlist their own friends and family members to open accounts  nominee account holders were promised quarterly payments at a fixed rate of return typically  percent in exchange the nominee account holders gave datek securities complete discretionary trading authority none of the nominee account holders directed the trading in the accounts and very few ever had contact with the traders  using an unlawful posttrading process defendants sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler assigned and allocated the proprietary soes trades to the aforementioned nominee accounts nominee accounts never made more than the guaranteed return  if accounts made more mccarty and citron ensured that datek securities kept the excess by adjusting commission charges and reassigning trades to other accounts  the posttrading allocation of trades was possible because the soes system did not require an order entry firm to identify a particular account to enter an order rather datek securities merely had to identify itself as an order entry firm datek securities traders executed soes trades without regard to any particular account and routinely violated the rules regarding maximum size orders traders did not create or fill out contemporaneous order tickets  from  to  and at the direction of sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler datek securities employees manually allocated datek securities trades among accounts after the close of the market mccarty and erik maschler specifically taught employees how to allocate trades and often performed the allocation themselves after the close of the market datek securities clerks reviewed a nasdaq printout of the days trades and matched the closest chronological soes buys and sells of the same security to free up the greatest amount of buying power which was the amount that could be purchased in a particular account based on margin requirements and the equity in the account after trades had been matched the clerks gave the list to backoffice employees to determine which trades would be assigned to each account trades were allocated to particular accounts in a manner that gave the firms records the appearance of compliance with nasd rules governing soes other factors in the allocation process included the margin requirement for the account and the rate of return guaranteed to the account in addition datek securities employees also assigned numerous profitable trades to certain favored accounts including accounts related to maschler citron and others  after the trades had been allocated they were entered into a computer system the resulting computer file was transferred to datek securities brooklyn office where the information was used to generate the firms accounting records including blotters trial balances and customer account statements the proprietary trades were unlawfully executed and falsely recorded as those of individual retail customers consequently datek securities books and records were false and inaccurate  in certain instances there were not enough nominee accounts to allocate all of the proprietary trades when this occurred a single account would be blown out meaning that a large number of trades would be allocated into the account subjecting the account to a day freeze under regulation t citron or mccarty directed which accounts would be blown out  beginning in early  the allocation process was carried out by means of a computer program developed for datek securities known as wire wire automated the unlawful trade allocation process and thus dramatically enhanced datek securities ability to conceal its proprietary soes trading from regulators datek securities programmed wire to allocate trades to particular accounts to achieve their guaranteed rates of return and to give the firms books and records the appearance of compliance with federal securities laws and nasd rules wire was run at the end of each trading day and as refined by datek securities at several different points during the day by automating the allocation process the wire software made it more difficult for securities regulators to detect the scheme because no preallocation documents were generated to permit comparison when the wire program could not identify an account with sufficient buying power a datek securities clerk would create a cross trade with the firms proprietary account in order to create sufficient buying power  datek securities continually made refinements to wire that allowed the firm to conceal its unlawful proprietary trading more efficiently and effectively by  datek securities had developed real time wire which as its name suggests allocated trades as they took place as described below real time wire was also used by datek securities to assign profitable soes trades to its proprietary account and to generate thousands of cross trades daily between its proprietary account and the nominee accounts allowing the firm to reap enormous profits  datek securities utilized real time wires allocation capabilities to conceal its proprietary trading from  until early  when it was gradually replaced by a practice referred to as mapping in which a specific trader was assigned to each account by the end of  each account had its own assigned trader but datek securities continued to manipulate transactions and commission charges to ensure the accounts achieved the guaranteed rate of return for example mccarty would sometimes instruct backoffice employees to swap entire days worth of trades from one account to another as a way to achieve the guaranteed rate of return those practices continued at heartland after it acquired datek securities daytrading operation in march  cross trades to conceal proprietary trading  the manhattan branch of datek securities under the direction of sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler also hid its unlawful trading activity by the manner in which the trades were executed from  through early  datek securities automatically generated a series of cross trades between nominee accounts and the firms proprietary trading account at the manhattan branch in a typical sequence of trades a nominee account would purchase a nasdaq quoted stock through soes the position would then be sold to the datek securities proprietary account at a markdown within minutes or sometimes hours the proprietary account would either sell the position through selectnet or sell the shares back to a datek securities customer account at a markup which would then sell the position on soes that sequence or its mirror image repeated itself hundreds or sometimes thousands of times each day each of those cross trades occurred without input or direction from any datek securities trader even though most of the cross trades individually resulted in only a small profit for the proprietary account the huge volume of trades flowing through the account each day generated substantial trading profits for datek securities the raft loan program  to perpetuate the proprietary trading scheme sheldon maschler and citron cycled a substantial portion of the trading profits back into datek securities through defendant raft investments inc raft a corporation controlled by sheldon maschler during the relevant period and by citron through at least may  beginning in may  defendants sheldon maschler citron erik maschler and entities under their control provided funds to the nominees under the guise of loans from raft with a few exceptions raft initially loaned each nominee  the raft loans were unsecured the vast majority of raft nominees did not have sufficient income or assets to obtain or repay the loans and would not have qualified for such an unsecured loan in an armslength transaction with a financial institution moreover raft nominees had no reason to believe that they were obligated to repay the loans raft typically charged the account holders  percent interest on the loans but because the nominees were generally guaranteed a  percent return the nominees kept the  percent difference thus the nominees were paid that difference for use of their identities  between may  and march  raft as funded by sheldon maschler citron erik maschler and other entities created by them made loans totaling at least  million to various individuals to open approximately  nominee accounts at datek securities those raftfunded nominee accounts were then used by datek securities and later heartland under the direction of sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler to conceal their unlawful proprietary soes scheme the funding and use of nominee accounts in such a manner made datek securities and heartland the beneficial owners of those accounts but neither datek securities nor heartland recorded such beneficial ownership accurately in their books and records  mccarty administered the raft loan program under the direction of sheldon maschler and citron mccarty provided the paperwork to nominees maintained the raft checkbook in his office and generally handled the ongoing administrative details for the raft account holders initially raft nominees were sent checks every quarter along with instructions  usually from mccarty  that they were to forward the specified interest portion back to raft later on the interest was wired directly to raft and a separate check was issued to the nominee account holder sheldon maschler citron mccarty and erik maschler knew the raft loans were part of the scheme to profit from and perpetuate the unlawful proprietary trading  mccarty closely monitored each nominee accounts rate of return on a spreadsheet and ensured that each achieved its guaranteed rate of return by allocating profitable trades to underperforming accounts and by manipulating commission rates distribution of profits to sheldon maschler and citron  the fraudulent scheme to engage in unlawful proprietary trading resulted in substantial profits these profits were paid to entities controlled by sheldon maschler citron and others  in  elbogen entered into an oral agreement with sheldon maschler whereby maschler received  percent of the profits generated by datek securities daytrading operation defendants sheldon maschler citron and mccarty sought to conceal this agreement  defendants citron mccarty and erik maschler also received unlawful profits directly and indirectly from the sheldon maschler profit pool  in  datek securities paid elm management corporation elm a company wholly owned by sheldon maschler and erik maschler approximately  million in  dateksecurities paid elm approximately  million elm in turn paid approximately  percent of those funds to treasure solutions treasure a company wholly owned by citron datek securities also paid  million directly to treasure in  between  and march  datek securities paid approximately  million to smithwall associates llc smithwall a limited liability company owned and controlled by citron trusts for the benefit of erik maschler and two of maschlers other children and others  mccarty calculated the amounts of the elm and treasure payments and either elbogen or zelcer signed the checks mccarty elbogen and zelcer knew or should have known that the payments were distributions of trading profits but participated in the effort to hide this fact  in  and  datek securities falsely classified the elm and treasure payments in its books and records initially datek securities classified the payments in its general ledger as commission expenses in december  elbogen instructed zelcer to reclassify the  elm and treasure payments in its general ledger as data processing expenses when zelcer raised concerns that the  reclassification would invite regulatory scrutiny elbogen rejected the concerns and instructed zelcer to make the reclassification despite a duty to ensure accuracy of datek securities books and records zelcer did nothing further to investigate the elm payments in addition datek securities did not reclassify the  elm and treasure payments in its general ledger  in   and  datek securities also falsely classified the elm and treasure payments in reports filed with the commission datek securities  focus filings which were prepared by zelcer and its  audited financial statements which were signed by zelcer classified the elm and treasure payments as salary and commission expenses the firms  audited financial statements which were signed by zelcer classified the payments to elm and treasure as computer services expenses datek securities focus report for the fourth quarter of  which was prepared by zelcer also reflected that change in classification the firms  audited financial statements which were signed by erik maschler and elbogen classified the elm payments as computer services expenses  at the time that zelcer falsely recorded and reclassified the elm payments at elbogens instruction no contemporaneous invoices or contracts existed to support the payments in mid when the commission staff requested documentation supporting the  and  payments sheldon maschler citron mccarty and others at datek securities prepared and backdated sets of agreements contracts and invoices between datek securities and elm between datek securities and treasure and between elm and treasure at mccartys direction zelcer produced the fictitious documents to the commission failure to disclose control persons  defendants and datek securities concealed and failed to disclose to the commission that maschler and citron were control persons of datek securities defendants and datek securities failed to disclose this fact in datek securities forms bd filed with the commission between  and  and failed to file amendments to the forms bd to correct the inaccurate information the forms bd filed with the commission were signed by either elbogen or zelcer both of whom knew that maschler and citron were control persons of datek securities maschler continued to control datek securities during his nasd suspension in   between late  and early  defendants caused datek securities to file at least eight forms bd with the commission that failed to disclose that maschler and citron controlled datek securities citron and maschler were never listed as control persons on any portion of theforms bd that required such information citron was never identified in schedule a to any of datek securities forms bd filed during this period maschler was listed as a shareholder several times but there was always a no next to his name under the column headed control person moreover on at least eight occasions between late  and early  datek securities responded no to question a of the forms bd another part of the form bd requiring identification of additional control persons continuation of proprietary trading scheme at heartland  from april  through june  defendants sheldon maschler mccarty and erik maschler continued to carry out the fraudulent soes trading scheme while in control of heartland which purchased datek securities daytrading business on march   in exchange for a promissory note of  million erik maschler and mccarty executed the sales agreement on behalf of heartland and datek securities respectively pursuant to the terms of the sales agreement heartland acquired those assets subject to liabilities relating to the daytrading business  heartlands trading practices were virtually identical to datek securities former daytrading operation the only operational difference was in name heartland traders continued to use the watcher system licencing the software from a subsidiary of datek online holdings doh sheldon maschler continued to exert undisclosed control over the operations and management of heartland just as he had at datek securities initially heartland was wholly owned by defendants erik maschler and elbogen but in late  elbogen sold a significant portion of his interest in the firm to two of sheldon maschlers other sons and mccarty during the relevant period mccarty was heartlands president and chief financial officer while erik maschler was heartlands chief executive officer and a vice president of the firm with responsibility for supervising the traders  the unlawful soes trading practices at datek securities continued unabated at heartland from april  through june  heartland unlawfully executed millions of trades on the soes system almost all of the trading profits were paid out to raft as interest or to erik maschler mccarty and elbogen as salary and dividends  the methods used to conceal the unlawful soes trading at datek securities allocation of trades to raftfunded nominee accounts manipulation of profits and losses creation of false books and records filing of false reports with the commission also continued virtually unabated at heartland all but five of the raft nominee accounts transferred from datek securities to heartland as of january   raft had approximately  loans outstanding to nominees whose accounts were maintained at heartland the loan amounts ranged from  to  and totaled  million in addition raft made at least  loans to new nominees at heartland during  for a total of  million the savings and loan conversion scheme  the second fraudulent scheme in many ways paralleled the proprietary soes trading scheme and involved the conduct of defendants sheldon maschler michael mccarty raft and jes in connection with the initial public offerings of three savings and loan associations maschler and mccarty had raft and jes extend sham loans to obtain the identities of depositors who held subscription rights to purchase shares in the initial public offerings of the three banks in many instances the depositors receiving the loans had insufficient assets to qualify for the amount of the loans as a result of these arrangements maschler and mccarty were able to obtain the subscription rights of at least  nominees which they then used to purchase shares in the banks initial public offerings after the banks went public the shares acquired were sold through accounts controlled by maschler and mccarty for an illegal profit of   savings and loan associations are either mutual associations mutual banks owned by their borrowers and account holders or stock associations stock banks owned by their shareholders either type may be federally chartered or state chartered mutual banks may convert to stock banks by issuing and selling shares of stock to the public federal and state banking regulators have developed detailed rules to ensure that these conversions will benefit the converting association its account holders and the general public

is a mighty leap for a high school graduate who started working at  as an office clerk in a small brooklyn brokerage firm called datek securities his big idea while the giant investment houses were tied up in ticker tape he was automating stock trading operations and paving the way to the  internet trade he even helped develop an electronic stock exchange that has been hailed by officials at the nasdaq stock market and the securities and exchange commission as innovative and revolutionaryevery so often someone comes around who cracks the code on wall street said bill burnham a stock analyst who tracks online brokerage firms for piper jaffray and citron just cracked the codetoday mr citron is the chief executive of the datek online holdings corporation which grew out of datek securities to become one of the nations fastestgrowing online brokerage firms he has been heralded as a technology wizard by forbes magazine and as one of the  most important players on the financial web by institutional investor advertisement continue reading the main story but as he steps into the spotlight with plans to take his online venture public a darker tale is creeping out of the shadows one that raises troubling questions about datek and threatens to undermine mr citrons stature as a wall street golden boy continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story for behind dateks burgeoning online empire in iselin nj is a securities firm with a murky and blemished past  a record of aggressive and sometimes illegal trading activity of fines censures and suspensions and of shadowy deals involving offshore accountsand not all of dateks problems are history sec officials are investigating whether datek was part of a stock manipulation scheme in recent years involving the sale of securities to overseas investors according to investigators law enforcement officials and a person supboenaed in the case the office of the manhattan district attorney meanwhile says it is looking into whether datek participated in a money laundering schemea group of former datek employees questioned last month told the district attorneys office that as recently as  the firm encouraged trading practices that were highly profitable but that they believed were prohibited by the national association of securities dealersthen there are mr citrons and dateks connections to robert e brennan the flamboyant pennystock promoter whom a federal judge in a civil case brought by the sec denounced in  for engaging in a massive and continuing fraud and who has been barred from the brokerage industrymr citrons mansion in brielle nj is built on the site of mr brennans home which mr citron bought in  for  million and tore down he also bought mr brennans jet for  million mr citron however denies that they have any other relationshipand in papers filed in his bankruptcy case mr brennan said he had borrowed  million from a company operated by sheldon maschler the chief trader at datek from  to  and the man who hired mr citron into the firm earlier mr maschler had worked for mr brennanmr citron  who has sought recently to distance himself from both men  vehemently denies that datek has been involved in any wrongdoing in a statement last week he called the accusations of money laundering and stock manipulation baseless and defamatory advertisement continue reading the main story former datek employees say it is just the kind of inquiry mr citron appeared to be worried about last year when he took full charge of datek eager to take datek online public associates say mr citron has tightened management controls outlawed many trading practices hired a major accounting firm and recently completed a spinoff of the firms trading unit the center of most of the questioned practicesmr citron who at  feet  inches is paunchy and personable rather than imposing prefers to talk about being a champion of the small investor or about how the internet is transforming the securities marketplace than about dateks troubled historywe dont want to be associated with that past the past of datek he said in an interview last month were a different company nowin the beginninga natural forges a strategic alliancethe past it seems has often been a difficult subject for jeffrey citron for instance he tells at least two versions of his upbringing on staten islandin one interview he described himself as the only son of middleclass parents who worked in the insurance business and as early as he could recall he was passionate about computers i was fascinated with technology all through my life he said the interest in wall street came later he said after a stockpicking contest in high schoolbut in a later interview when pressed he acknowledged that his father howard citron pleaded guilty in the early s to falsifying business records at wakefield securities a small new york firm in part of what the manhattan district attorney called a massive stockrigging scheme that cost investors millions of dollars law enforcement officials said his father was also a heavy gambler who served two months in a federal prison in  for peddling cocainethe subject clearly unsettles the younger mr citron who says he fears that others will draw false parallels my father should be no reflection on my abilities he said it only puts a blemish upon meit was however his fathers connections that led him to wall street sheldon maschler who grew up with howard citron in brooklyn and was a close friend ran a trading operation at datek securities jeffrey citron went to work there in  a month after graduating from high school while he was growing up hed see shelly trading and that was the spark said mario russo a childhood friend advertisement continue reading the main story mr citron started as a clerk in a small datek office a few blocks from the new york stock exchange he was your typical office boy said aaron elbogen a founder of datek but at some point we realized he was a very bright kidsoon mr citron was trading and those who remember say his analytic bent made him a natural it wasnt too long before jeffrey popped up with his mercedes mr russo saidby age  mr citron said he had earned  million his net worth mushroomed a few years later when he used his computer skills to automate much of the daily brokerage operationhis ally was a something computer programmer named joshua levine another new yorker who had found his way into mr maschlers camp we had a deal mr citron recalled i said you teach me everything you know about programming and ill teach you how to trade although mr levine had dropped out of high school he was by all accounts a programming genius  smart enough to build a stock quotation system for tiger management the hedge fund run by julian h robertson jrworking out of the basement of mr maschlers staten island home where datek had moved its fourman trading operation in  mr citron and mr levine found faster cheaper ways to broker stocks me and jeff would come in at midnight mr levine said we would split the wires on the nasdaq monitor to serve several traders and save the amonitor chargewhen mr citron arrived on wall street in the late s his chief complaint was all the paperwork but no longer people didnt have to come in at  am anymore he said the computers did everythingwho is thismining a glitch striking it richif computers could make the office more efficient and profitable why couldnt they do the same for the trading operation advertisement continue reading the main story the logic was not lost on mr citron he told mr levine about arbitrage trading  buying and selling to profit from sometimes slight differences in the prices of two similar but fluctuating assets like a warrant that carries the right to buy a stock and the underlying stock itself the two of them went to work we created a system that alerted you to arbitrage mr levine says what that meant was that if the stock went up you hit the lotto and the first day we made like a gazillion billion dollarstheir big break though came with the small order execution system or soes on the nasdaq stock market which was meant to give smaller investors better access to the market in  the sec ordered dealers who made a market in overthecounter stocks to use soes an electronic system that allows brokers to execute orders via a computer rather than the telephone it meant instantaneous executionalmost immediately professional traders picked up on a glitch because the system automatically executed orders at the prices listed by market makers those who were slow to update their prices could be forced to execute an electronic order at an outdated price even if it meant a lossharvey i houtkin the founder of the alltech investment group in montvale nj found a way to exploit this system but datek under mr maschlers guidance perfected it and a program created by mr citron and mr levine was so effective and efficient that datek armed with just a few traders and computers began racking up big profitsmarket makers complained that rogue traders or soes bandits were profiting unfairly from these inefficiencies regulators though made only minor changes as a result the soes trades created a small revolution on wall street big brokerage houses were pummeled by small firms in places like jersey

from  million in  the market makers hated datek because they were making millions mr houtkin recalled they were hated probably more than any other firm on wall streetone reason for dateks success was its innovative software programs like watcher and the monster key  programs that other soes houses eventually licensed or mimicked mr citron and mr levine meanwhile created an array of companies to orbit around datek including smith wall associates a computer services concern that had sales of  million in  it was from many of these companies that the two say they made much of their fortunes tens of millions of dollars they even won over regulators by developing an electronic stock exchange called island a system that now handles about  percent of all nasdaq trading volumethe networks they built particularly the ones that did soes trading were so powerful that they strained the nasdaq stock markets computer operations we were saying who is this  said john t wall a nasdaq executive

also sanctioned in  mr citron was fined  and suspended for  days neither mr maschler nor mr citron admitted to any wrongdoingeven though mr maschler was suspended and shed all his datek shares in  current and former employees say mr maschler remains a presence at the firm for example although his oneyear suspension began on feb   datek traders say he continued to attend monthly meetings at a manhattan banquet room and even spoke at one in a written response to a reporters questions about mr maschlers suspension datek officials said he had not been involved in the firm since  and that if he visited he attended only social events such as company parties golf outings and other similar eventsnew charges have surfaced recently two weeks ago the sec filed a civil fraud suit contending that mr maschler and four others including executives at the alter sales company an automotive firm in florida collaborated in a  scheme to sell unregistered alter shares to a fictitious foreign investorthe suit contends that mr maschler serving as the datek account executive for the fictitious investor failed to make adequate inquiries to determine whether there were any restrictions on the sales of those shares the proceeds of which were later placed in offshore accounts the sec says it is seeking disgorgement of  million in illegal profits from mr maschler and the others advertisement continue reading the main story the sovereign equity management corporation of boca raton fla a brokerage firm that was closed down by the nasd last year for repeated infractions was also named by the government as a participant in the schemedatek itself is accused of doing something similar in  last year the fortune petroleum company now called fortune natural resources sued datek in federal district court in manhattan contending that the firm manipulated its stock in conjunction with an overseas offering that apparently benefited six foreign investors who resold the shares through a datek account the israel trading fund  a small new york firm that has ceased operations  was also named in the suitthe case is pending and the sec is investigating whether datek and the israel trading fund were involved in a stock manipulation scheme dealing with overseas securities offerings said a person who was subpoenaed datek says it has moved to dismiss the suit but will vigorously defend itself if necessarythree former datek traders said that when they were questioned last month by the office of the manhattan district attorney they were asked about the israel trading fund but an investigator said the focus was a money laundering schemethe traders said they also told the investigators that as recently as last year they were encouraged by seasoned traders and managers at datek to engage in trading practices that they believed were prohibited by the nasd one example socalled rapidfire trading which they said involved using the soes system to trade blocks of shares in sizes forbidden by regulators and then using a computer to split the blocks thereby masking the size of the tradesin the middlemore trials and tribulationsthough not charged mr maschler has been subpoenaed in a civil case against mr brennan that is now approaching trial the new jersey attorney generals office says that in the early s several brokerage firms controlled by mr brennan manipulated the prices of four stocks by trading them among themselves mr brennan investigators say may have made up to  milliondatek was an intermediary in the movement of securities from brennan to the brokers he controlled said harlan i ettinger deputy attorney general in new jersey weve alleged maschler was the trader who handled those transactionsmr maschlers ties to mr brennan are certainly extensive in a deposition last year in his bankruptcy case mr brennan said he had an account worth  million at two brokerage firms through a company he owned called pirates associates one of those firms he said was datek mr brennan also said that in  he borrowed  million from elm management a real estate company owned by mr maschler advertisement continue reading the main story mr citron said it was mr maschler who told him mr brennans house was for sale in an interview last month mr citron said he did not know mr brennan and had met him only once asked later about reports of other meetings he acknowledged at least  encounters including one at a dinner party at mr brennans juno beach fla mansion when i said i met him once i really meant under one event  the buying of his house mr citron explained because i bought his house and subsequently bought his plane people try and make an association there is no relationship between me and bob brennanmr citron said moreover that he does not admire mr brennan whose history he calls deplorableand mr brennan issued a terse statement by fax which read in part i am not now nor have i ever been involved in any way in managing advising influencing or funding datek mr citron or any other persons associated with datekmr citron who initially cooperated for this article declined to answer further questions last week a lawyer representing mr citron left a telephone message requesting that publication be delayed and saying that the allegations against datek are absolutely falsemoving onplacing eggs in internet basketby all accounts jeffrey citron is trying to distance himself and datek online from mr maschler mr brennan and the old soes trading unit which has grown less profitable as the technology it developed has become more widely available

me up how i did it how i did it jeffrey citron first he disrupted the brokerage business now with vonage jeffrey citron is changing the game on the phone companies by jeffrey citron write a comment credit as told to brian l clark jeffrey citron is an excitable entrepreneur who likes to talk about his track record for starting companies disrupting industries and making money in  he disrupted the financial services industry when he created island ecn a hightech trading system that allowed investors to trade shares by entering buy and sell orders into a single database he sold it in  for  million in  he started the online brokerage datek online which targeted day traders and was sold for  billion in  citron however had been forced to leave in  because of an illegaltrading dispute with the sec that he ultimately settled  without admitting any wrongdoing  by paying a  million fine thats something he says he cant discuss but hes more than happy to talk about his latest venture vonage the broadband phone company based in edison nj that lets users make phone calls over the internet and plans to introduce a wifi handset later this year the company in which citron invested more than  million of his own money has  subscribers and expects  million in revenue this year i took an economics class in high school and part of the class was to pick securities one i picked was mci watching what happened in the markets translating that into decisions getting a daily update on how youre doing  its a very painful and rewarding experience one days pain is the next days drug so i pursued a career on wall street which is probably the most competitive environment in the world being bred out of that gives you a certain drive its the same here at vonage except its  hours a day seven days a week thats been the hardest transition  you have to say im going to stop now i like to work with disruptive technologies that require a lot of capital for marketing but not for building a service you dont have to build a factory or a plant it scales easily being an entrepreneur is like being a parent you want to nurture your young children or your young companies and take an active and dominant role in their lives making sure they grow up appropriately and as they get older you start ceding authority you can still be a very active parent and in the case of vonage i probably will be for a long time dont listen to the naysayers even with vonage there are still lots of naysayers they just dont have the vision and the forethought to see how the worlds going to change we started working on vonage in august of  we decided to form this company  with a small amount of capital  million  whose sole purpose was to take our ideas and turn them into a commercial workable product after that we raised a little more money to see how quickly we could build a real service the issue was how do you explain the product we tried talking about it in terms of voip and we found that confused a lot of people we tried broadband phone company and that worked  its how we are known today and then after we figured out how to price it market it and distribute it only then did we go forward and start selling it we spent almost a year figuring out the marketingone of the key moments was when we took one ip phone and made it ring another and then i took that phone home and i plugged it into the broadband connection in my house and called the guys in the office  and we had phone service we had a number of technological hurdles we had to make the service work with home networks and  thats a huge challenge because with vonage someone living in la can have a  number so an emergency call would go to new york i also think you have to redefine quality people arent sensitive so much to voice quality  many use cell phones to reduce their long distance bills but at the end of the day they keep the landline because cell phone reliability isnt good enough when you go to dial your phone call does it go through how many calls drop that people will not sacrifice this market was ripe for someone to take a fresh look and say what can we do differently the telecom industry hadnt changed much in almost a hundred years technology has improved service quality and economics but for the most part the systems that were built in the s are still operating the larger companies arent going to cannibalize their own business to stop a small competitor like vonage they arent going to try to convert all their customers to voip remember weve competed with att now for nearly two years and weve competed with time warner for nearly two years and weve competed with cablevision for nearly two years and based on the most recent market data vonage had over  lines in service now more than  and the two cable operators each had a little over  and att had somewhere around  we overcame a tremendous challenge not only to establish a leadership position but also to maintain that position over the last nine quarters weve added more customers than any other operator the initial delay with the wifi phone came from maintaining good battery life our goal is to make sure your talk time is comparable to what you would get with a cell phone or a home cordless phone now we think weve got that one licked once the field trials are perfect were going to go live with the product the consumer market is so big about  million homes wed love to get to  million lines in service and thats a great number for a company thats only a couple of years old compared with an entrenched bell its sort of ironic that the people who started all this may very well not be here when its all said and done published on jul     go to how i did it for more episodes citron jeffrey a form  insider trading history

after all pay a staggering  million settlement to the sec just last yearhe isnt letting on hes brashly holding forth seated at a makeshift conference table which is covered by a cheap white tablecloth the topic his latest brainstormturnedbusiness called vonage the yearold citron who never went to college is so wound up that he jumps to the next idea before he finishes the last one right hell ask repeatedly trying to confirm that his point is understood before he nails the next one hes so energetic hell simply stand up midsentence unable to stay still my involvement in any company is very emotional he says hours before he flies in his private jet to congressional meetings about potential industry regulation i commit every bit of energy and resources i can afford surely he has ample reserves of both since  hes invested more than  million of his own moneycollected from two earlier ventures that were acquiredto start vonage pronounced vohnij an upstart in the newly crowded field of internetbased phone companies this service allows residential and smallbusiness users to make phone calls that are routed primarily over the internet at cheaper rates than conventional phone service more from fsb help wanted for hr firm a ceo and rodeo queen king of the mountain bike current issue since launching its product in january  the privately held company based in edison nj has attracted more customers than all the other industry players combined of them of which  are businesses with ten phone lines or fewer but vonages domination may be shortlived att is coming this spring behind such giants as comcast and time warner cable owned by the parent of fsbs publisher which have joined the fray in the past nine months shouldnt this entrepreneur seem more worried citron always takes a very aggressive approach to the market notes harry weller a partner at new enterprise associates a menlo park calif venture capital firm that led a  million round of investment in vonage in november a  million round led by meritech and i was announced in february weller says his firm did quite a bit of work spending nine months conducting its due diligence before funding vonage citrons last venture datek online holdings launched in  grew to be the fourthlargest online brokerage in just three yearswhich is about as long as citron stayed in charge in  the securities and exchange commission began investigating activity at dateks daytrading division citron along with others was eventually cited for breaking nasd rules by making trades for institutions on a system designed for individual investors and then trying to cover those trades up what began with a  fine and a day suspension for stock manipulation resulted in citron stepping down in  recalls mort david then a datek director jeffrey finally understood that for everyone to realize the companys value including him he had to step aside citron sold his stake for an estimated  million the following year then in january  he agreed to pay a  million settlement to the sec without admitting wrongdoing he was also permanently barred from working with any brokers or dealers by then rival ameritrade had plunked down  billion for datek citron insists angrily that the episode hasnt left any scars it hasnt affected me at all he grumbles notes david its hard to be regretful if youre  and have hundreds of millions in cash perhaps but citron acts like an entrepreneur with something to prove he boasts of pulling allnighters shrugs off suggestions that his legal problems may not make him the ideal ceo and swats away any mention of his wellheeled rivals even if i capture a small percentage of the  million broadband users this is a billiondollar company in annual revenue he says and if he doesnt vonage is positioned really well he says the pie is big enough for everyone and we have great margins he adds standing up for emphasis given citrons résumé it would be easy to mistake him for a tech geek in  he founded the island ecn electronic communication network a computerized trading system for brokerdealers which instinet group acquired in june  for about  million citron who left ecn in  is less interested in technology breakthroughs than he is in retooling them for the masses for him it matters less that his three startups have been internetoriented than that their business models share other traitsa steady revenue stream either from brokers or consumers and the potential to grow to a mammoth scale i like technologies that can be highly disruptive to a controlled industry shifting the market and bringing its costs down he says it certainly wasnt apparent that vonages first incarnationthe name intends to invoke the age of voice over the netpossessed such potential when citron signed on in  not long after exiting datek he got a call from jeffrey pulver cofounder of a company called minxcom in melville ny pulver then  asked citron to invest in an electronic trading network that sold telecom minutes for phone companies citron was intrigued because he was frustrated with phone services high costs he invested and soon signed on as an executivehe couldnt trade securities but he could trade minutes citron believed that minxcom had the potential to make many millions of dollars in annual revenues but he wanted to build a multibilliondollar business thats why he suggested using the same system to offer internet phone service to consumers citron rechristened the company vonage in january  and took over as ceo jeffrey proposed we jump ahead and give the technology directly to the consumer says louis holder vonages head of product development citron didnt care that no one had successfully deployed voip voice over internet protocol for real use voip technology routes phone calls primarily over the internet rather than exclusively over phone lines a flat monthly fee covers unlimited national calls through a little box that customers hook up to their phone and into their broadband modems since the mids equipmentladen hobbyists have experimented with iterations of this technology but it usually involved talking directly into a computer and communicating only with users of the same system citron made the technology accessible turning a regular phone into an internet appliance about as complicated as an answering machine and his phone service is cheaper because he avoids traditional phone companies expensive infrastructure and overhead and he circumvents portions of baby bells and rural phone companies pricey access fees citrons drive to make the technology appeal to laymen has been especially apparent in vonages marketing voip was a bad word in the industry it meant crappy technology outside the industry people dont care about acronyms citron says we called it broadband phone vonages appeal was just as simple price is key citron shouts in an entrylevel plan any user pays just  including taxes for  minutes of calls around the us and to canada the list of extras includes such features as the ability to receive voicemail as an attachment to email and the company targets small businesses by offering them such options as the ability to create additional virtual phone numbers in other area codes that provides convenience for customers while creating the impression that the vonage user has branch offices for details on cost savings see free speech on the next page consumers seem to be picking up citrons message in the year since launching its voip service vonage has become a millionayear business growing  a quarter for the past three quarters citron expects the company to show a net profit in the second half of this year to solidify vonages roughly  market share citron has penned deals with retailers such as amazon and best buy he has also signed partnerships with five cable companies and two internet service providers so that vonage can bundle its service with their broadband or internet access such arrangements give vonage access to a raft of cheaply acquired customers while its partners can sell vonages service under their names but citrons success has also attracted competitors when att said it was going to release a vonagelike service nothing made me happier boasts citron it acknowledges theres no other way to do what we do maybe so but the arrival of a  billion competitor may yet change citrons mood citron likes to wear his firstmover advantage label as if it were just coming into fashion but plenty of companiesdo webvan etoys and netscape ring any bellshave proven how handily an innovator can get squashed by latecomers where is vonage vulnerable one weak spot could be service quality vonage has to buy capacity from other telecom and broadband companies which could cause customers to experience a delay while talking if suppliers dont prioritize vonages business according to muayyad alchalabi an internet telephony consultant at rhk a telecom research firm in san francisco vonages competitors by contrast own more of their own infrastructure because vonages calls go on the public internet they cant fully guarantee the quality of service claims keith cocozza a spokesman for time warner cable furthermore companies including att and time warner start with huge bases of potential customers and can position themselves as the convenient choicebundling cable broadband and voip service on one bill consumers says cocozza love the allinclusive flat rate and the single point of contact another disadvantage for vonage it doesnt offer phone numbers in all area codes citron rejects each looming challenge as if hes rushing to cross items off a grocery list vonages quality is consistent he argues plus its options are more advanced and its customer service more personal than at a larger company cable operators may be able to bundle services he notes but because they are regional they cant offer such vonage perks as the ability to transfer a number nationwide and virtual numbers in farflung area codes and even though att plans to target both business and home customers citron contends that it will focus on largescale enterprises leaving him the homes and small businesses there will be a
