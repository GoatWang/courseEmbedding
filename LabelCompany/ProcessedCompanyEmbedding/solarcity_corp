players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on buffalo billion money on april   thenus attorney preet bharara of the southern district of new york began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts buffalo billion was a part of that investigation many companies have been subpoenaed and have provided information including solarcity and the office of new york governor andrew cuomo solarcity is not the subject or focus of the investigation and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting the united states attorneys office for the southern district of new york is leading a federal inquiry into buffalo billion prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for solarcity and other components of the buffalo billion project the subpoenas sought information about how governmentfunded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the buffalo area in february three executives who worked for lpciminelli development who were arrested in  in a federal bidrigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from manhattan to buffalo the three men face a count indictment for wire fraud and

with the company the new york state legislature plans to approve a budget by april   that would give  million more into the buffalo billion program in return the legislature wants the cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent oregon attorney general investigationedit on march   the oregonian said that campaign for accountability a dcbased consumer advocacy group and other groups have asked oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels in violation of oregons unlawful trade practices act according to the oregonian the request to rosenblum singled out one company californiabased solarcity it outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by oregonians who claimed theyd been misled about costs tax credits and energy savings by the company the campaign for accountability reviewed  complaints that consumers filed with the oregon department of justice and said that the complaints indicated a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies a spokesman for the campaign for accountability said solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations leaving senior oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay plunging them into debt the oregon solar energy industry association said that it examined the complaints and found the numbers to be relatively low  lower than those being cited by the campaign for accountability solar by degree projectedit after an investigation initiated by the oregonian martin shain the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two oregon universities was indicted on two counts of firstdegree forgery by a marion county grand jury august   shain who is a consultant for bacgen technologies in seattle is a key player in the controversial  million solar by degree project and is accused of creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly  million in tax credits from the oregon department of energy the project began in  and was sponsored by the oregon university system thousands of solar panels generating millions of kilowatts of power per year were constructed on  acres on the campuses of oregon state university and the oregon institute of technology in klamath falls the states case revolves around two documents which include an invoice from solar foundations systems dated february   and a december  letter signed by ryan davies the former head of redco a utahbased company which was also the second developer on the project according to kointv the davies letter reported  had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing the solar foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays the invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state the solar by degree project ultimately received the tax credits but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice solar foundations does not exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us” customer litigationedit since  solarcity has lowered the minimum fico score required for customers to get the leasing deals it uses the score of  a “fair” credit rating as the cutoff however between  solarcity signed longterm lease agreements with at least  homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages the company has been named in  lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings in its response solarcity said in a statement to the new york times out of more than  installed customers solarcity is currently involved in  such proceedings the litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank” customer cancellation investigationedit the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating sunrun and solarcity in may  looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts some customers say they canceled contracts after being strongarmed into solarenergy deals and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general the federal government is investigating whether solar companies are masking how many customers they are losing the sec is involved because investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health according to the wall street journal to generate business solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like home depot inc according to salespeople executives and homeowners some customers say they were strongarmed into buying solarenergy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a socalled mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a homeimprovement project others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts the checks and balances projectedit solarcity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the checks and balances project the project has criticized the elected members of the arizona corporation commission the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in arizona for being too wellconnected to utility companies the checks and balances project has filed several requests for public records from the arizona corporation commission in july  the federal bureau of investigation interviewed the head of checks and

hemisphere when it opens hiring for the factory is expected in spring of  and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of  the factory will be located in an innovation hub called the hightech manufacturing innovation hub at riverbend the state appropriated  million in funding for the hub according to daily energy insider the facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about  solar panels per day solarcity is required to spend  billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than  direct manufacturing jobs as of may  federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the buffalo billion program were distributed solarcity was a partner in the program the company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the buffalo river in may  new york state officials postponed the approval of almost  million for the solarcity project according to the new york times buffalo billion will benefit a tangle of wellconnected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on buffalo billion money on april   thenus attorney preet bharara of the southern district of new york began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts buffalo billion was a part of that investigation many companies have been subpoenaed and have provided information including solarcity and the office of new york governor andrew cuomo solarcity is not the subject or focus of the investigation and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting the united states attorneys office for the southern district of new york is leading a federal inquiry into buffalo billion prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for solarcity and other components of the buffalo billion project the subpoenas sought information about how governmentfunded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the buffalo area in february three executives who worked for lpciminelli development who were arrested in  in a federal bidrigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from manhattan to buffalo the three men face a count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the solarcity riverbend construction contract additionally five other people have been charged with related crimes the trials will begin in late spring of  an albany firm called whitman osterman and hannah represented both lpciminelli and fort schuyler management corporation which was a subsidiary of suny

cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company the new york state legislature plans to approve a budget by april   that would give  million more into the buffalo billion program in return the legislature wants the cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent oregon attorney general investigationedit on march   the oregonian said that campaign for accountability a dcbased consumer advocacy group and other groups have asked oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels in violation of oregons unlawful trade practices act according to the oregonian the request to rosenblum singled out one company californiabased solarcity it outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by oregonians who claimed theyd been misled about costs tax credits and energy savings by the company the campaign for accountability reviewed  complaints that consumers filed with the oregon department of justice and said that the complaints indicated a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies a spokesman for the campaign for accountability said solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations leaving senior oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay plunging them into debt the oregon solar energy industry association said that it examined the complaints and found the numbers to be relatively low  lower than those being cited by the campaign for accountability solar by degree projectedit after an investigation initiated by the oregonian martin shain the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two oregon universities was indicted on two counts of firstdegree forgery by a marion county grand jury august   shain who is a consultant for bacgen technologies in seattle is a key player in the controversial  million solar by degree project and is accused of creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly  million in tax credits from the oregon department of energy the project began in  and was sponsored by the oregon university system thousands of solar panels generating millions of kilowatts of power per year were constructed on  acres on the campuses of oregon state university and the oregon institute of technology in klamath falls the states case revolves around two documents which include an invoice from solar foundations systems dated february   and a december  letter signed by ryan davies the former head of redco a utahbased company which was also the second developer on the project according to kointv the davies letter reported  had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing the solar foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays the invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state the solar by degree project ultimately received the tax credits but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice solar foundations does not exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil

exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us” customer litigationedit since  solarcity has lowered the minimum fico score required for customers to get the leasing deals it uses the score of  a “fair” credit rating as the cutoff however between  solarcity signed longterm lease agreements with at least  homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages the company has been named in  lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings in its response solarcity said in a statement to the new york times out of more than  installed customers solarcity is currently involved in  such proceedings the litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank” customer cancellation investigationedit the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating sunrun and solarcity in may  looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts some customers say they canceled contracts after being strongarmed into solarenergy deals and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general the federal government is investigating whether solar companies are masking how many customers they are losing the sec is involved because investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health according to the wall street journal to generate business solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like home depot inc according to salespeople executives and homeowners some customers say they were strongarmed into buying solarenergy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a socalled mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a homeimprovement project others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts the checks and balances projectedit solarcity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the checks and balances project the project has criticized the elected members of the arizona corporation commission the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in arizona for being too wellconnected to utility companies the checks and balances project has filed several requests for public records from the arizona corporation commission in july  the federal bureau of investigation interviewed the head of checks and balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain arizona statewide races in  project financing and the google fundedit solarcity partners with banks large corporations

also being tested in vermont installation technologyedit solarcity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by zep solar which it acquired in  zep is best known for inventing a system that allows pv installers to snap together panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time zep solars technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types solar roofedit in the august  earnings call elon musk announced that solar city would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof stating it’s not a thing on a roof it is the roof as solar

colonial street backlot street set in late october  also unveiled was the tesla powerwall  a home battery product designed to store surplus power either from the tiles or from the grid consumer reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing governmentfunded collaborationedit the sunshot initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all americans it is run by the us department of energys solar energy technologies office and funds research development demonstration and deployment projects it is a collaboration of private companies universities state and local governments and nonprofits as well as national laboratories the program began in  with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by  by  the program achieved  of the progress towards the  goal in the fiscal year  congressional budget the program was appropriated  million according to the us department of energys appropriation request for that year the program also encourages systems integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve

york in areas across western new york one of the main features of the program is a  million square foot solar panel factory called solarcity riverbend it will be owned by solarcity which is the largest solar provider in the united states the factory is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the western hemisphere when it opens hiring for the factory is expected in spring of  and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of  the factory will be located in an innovation hub called the hightech manufacturing innovation hub at riverbend the state appropriated  million in funding for the hub according to daily energy insider the facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about  solar panels per day solarcity is required to spend  billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than  direct manufacturing jobs as of may  federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the buffalo billion program were distributed solarcity was a partner in the program the company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the buffalo river in may  new york state officials postponed the approval of almost  million for the solarcity project according to the new york times buffalo billion will benefit a tangle of wellconnected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on buffalo billion money on april   thenus attorney preet bharara of the southern district of new york began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts buffalo billion was a part of that investigation many companies have been subpoenaed and have provided information including solarcity and the office of new york governor andrew cuomo solarcity is not the subject or focus of the investigation and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting the united states attorneys office for the southern district of new york is leading a federal inquiry into buffalo billion prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for solarcity and other components of the buffalo billion project the subpoenas sought information about how governmentfunded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the buffalo area in february three executives who worked for lpciminelli development who were arrested in  in a federal bidrigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from manhattan to buffalo the three men face a count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the solarcity riverbend construction contract additionally five other people have been charged with related crimes the trials will begin in late spring of  an albany firm called whitman osterman and hannah represented both lpciminelli and fort schuyler management corporation which was a subsidiary of suny polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where solarcity is being built the governors office said that the formal awarding of the solarcity contract was made by fort schuyler on behalf of the state on may   the public authorities control board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve  million in new funds for solarcity as late as may  solarcity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company the new york state legislature plans to approve a budget by april   that would give  million more into the buffalo billion program in return the legislature wants the cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent oregon attorney general investigationedit on march   the oregonian said that campaign for accountability a dcbased consumer advocacy group and other groups have asked oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels in violation of oregons unlawful trade practices act according to the oregonian the request to rosenblum singled out one company californiabased solarcity it outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by oregonians who claimed theyd been misled about costs tax credits and energy savings by the company the campaign for accountability reviewed  complaints that consumers filed with the oregon department of justice and said that the complaints indicated a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies a spokesman for the campaign for accountability said solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations leaving senior oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay plunging them into debt the oregon solar energy industry association said that it examined the complaints and found the numbers to be relatively low  lower than those being cited by the campaign for accountability solar by degree projectedit after an investigation initiated by the oregonian martin shain the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two oregon universities was indicted on two counts of firstdegree forgery by a marion county grand jury august   shain who is a consultant for bacgen technologies in seattle is a key player in the controversial  million solar by degree project and is accused of creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly  million in tax credits from the oregon department of energy the project began in  and was sponsored by the oregon university system thousands of solar panels generating millions of kilowatts of power per year were constructed on  acres on the campuses of oregon state university and the oregon institute of technology in klamath falls the states case revolves around two documents which include an invoice from solar foundations systems dated february   and a december  letter signed by ryan davies the former head of redco a utahbased company which was also the second developer on the project according to kointv the davies letter reported  had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing the solar foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays the invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state the solar by degree project ultimately received the tax credits but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice solar foundations does not exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us” customer litigationedit since  solarcity has lowered the minimum fico score required for customers to get the leasing deals it uses the score of  a “fair” credit rating as the cutoff however between  solarcity signed longterm lease agreements with at least  homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages the company has been named in  lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings in its response solarcity said in a statement to the new york times out of more than  installed customers solarcity is currently involved in  such proceedings the litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank” customer cancellation investigationedit the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating sunrun and solarcity in may  looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts some customers say they canceled contracts after being strongarmed into solarenergy deals and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general the federal government is investigating whether solar companies are masking how many customers they are losing the sec is involved because investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health according to the wall street journal to generate business solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like home depot inc according to salespeople executives and homeowners some customers say they were strongarmed into buying solarenergy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a socalled mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a homeimprovement project others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts the checks and balances projectedit solarcity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the checks and balances project the project has criticized the elected members of the arizona corporation commission the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in arizona for being too wellconnected to utility companies the checks and balances project has filed several requests for public records from the arizona corporation commission in july  the federal bureau of investigation interviewed the head of checks and balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain arizona statewide races in  project financing and the google fundedit solarcity partners with banks large corporations

players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on buffalo billion money on april   thenus attorney preet bharara of the southern district of new york began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts buffalo billion was a part of that investigation many companies have been subpoenaed and have provided information including solarcity and the office of new york governor andrew cuomo solarcity is not the subject or focus of the investigation and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting the united states attorneys office for the southern district of new york is leading a federal inquiry into buffalo billion prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for solarcity and other components of the buffalo billion project the subpoenas sought information about how governmentfunded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the buffalo area in february three executives who worked for lpciminelli development who were arrested in  in a federal bidrigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from manhattan to buffalo the three men face a count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the solarcity riverbend construction contract additionally five other people have been charged with related crimes the trials will begin in late spring of  an albany firm called whitman osterman and hannah represented both lpciminelli and fort schuyler management corporation which was a subsidiary of suny polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where solarcity is being built the governors office said that the formal awarding of the solarcity contract was made by fort schuyler on behalf of the state on may   the public authorities control board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve  million in new funds for solarcity as late as may  solarcity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company the new york state legislature plans to approve a budget by april   that would give  million more into the buffalo billion program in return the legislature wants the cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent oregon attorney general investigationedit on march   the oregonian said that campaign for accountability a dcbased consumer advocacy group and other groups have asked oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels in violation of oregons unlawful trade practices act according to the oregonian the request to rosenblum singled out one company californiabased solarcity it outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by oregonians who claimed theyd been misled about costs tax credits and energy savings by the company the campaign for accountability reviewed  complaints that consumers filed with the oregon department of justice and said that the complaints indicated a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies a spokesman for the campaign for accountability said solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations leaving senior oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay plunging them into debt the oregon solar energy industry association said that it examined the complaints and found the numbers to be relatively low  lower than those being cited by the campaign for accountability solar by degree projectedit after an investigation initiated by the oregonian martin shain the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two oregon universities was indicted on two counts of firstdegree forgery by a marion county grand jury august   shain who is a consultant for bacgen technologies in seattle is a key player in the controversial  million solar by degree project and is accused of creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly  million in tax credits from the oregon department of energy the project began in  and was sponsored by the oregon university system thousands of solar panels generating millions of kilowatts of power per year were constructed on  acres on the campuses of oregon state university and the oregon institute of technology in klamath falls the states case revolves around two documents which include an invoice from solar foundations systems dated february   and a december  letter signed by ryan davies the former head of redco a utahbased company which was also the second developer on the project according to kointv the davies letter reported  had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing the solar foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays the invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state the solar by degree project ultimately received the tax credits but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice solar foundations does not exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us” customer litigationedit since  solarcity has lowered the minimum fico score required for customers to get the leasing deals it uses the score of  a “fair” credit rating as the cutoff however between  solarcity signed longterm lease agreements with at least  homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages the company has been named in  lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings in its response solarcity said in a statement to the new york times out of more than  installed customers solarcity is currently involved in  such proceedings the litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank” customer cancellation investigationedit the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating sunrun and solarcity in may  looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts some customers say they canceled contracts after being strongarmed into solarenergy deals and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general the federal government is investigating whether solar companies are masking how many customers they are losing the sec is involved because investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health according to the wall street journal to generate business solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like home depot inc according to salespeople executives and homeowners some customers say they were strongarmed into buying solarenergy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a socalled mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a homeimprovement project others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts the checks and balances projectedit solarcity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the checks and balances project the project has criticized the elected members of the arizona corporation commission the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in arizona for being too wellconnected to utility companies the checks and balances project has filed several requests for public records from the arizona corporation commission in july  the federal bureau of investigation interviewed the head of checks and

congressional budget the program was appropriated  million according to the us department of energys appropriation request for that year the program also encourages systems integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards and tools for understanding grid integration issues solarcity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the energy departments national renewable energy laboratory and the hawaiian electric

solarcity sued salt river project an electric utility for violation of the sherman antitrust act on march   case number cv being heard before judge douglas l rayes this is in response to salt river imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panelsneeds update buffalo billionedit buffalo billion is a billiondollar program from the administration of new york gov andrew cuomo the programs intention is to revitalize buffalo new york in areas across western new york one of the main features of the program is a  million square foot solar panel factory called solarcity riverbend it will be owned by solarcity which is the largest solar provider in the united states the factory is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the western hemisphere when it opens hiring for the factory is expected in spring of  and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of  the factory will be located in an innovation hub called the hightech manufacturing innovation hub at riverbend the state appropriated  million in funding for the hub according to daily energy insider the facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about  solar panels per day solarcity is required to spend  billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than  direct manufacturing jobs as of may  federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the buffalo billion program were distributed solarcity was a partner in the program the company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the buffalo river in may  new york state officials postponed the approval of almost  million for the solarcity project according to the new york times buffalo billion will benefit a tangle of wellconnected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on buffalo billion money on april   thenus attorney preet bharara of the southern district of new york began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts buffalo billion was a part of that investigation many companies have been subpoenaed and have provided information including solarcity and the office of new york governor andrew cuomo solarcity is not the subject or focus of the investigation and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting the united states attorneys office for the southern district of new york is leading a federal inquiry into buffalo billion prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for solarcity and other components of the buffalo billion project the subpoenas sought information about how governmentfunded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the buffalo area in february three executives who worked for lpciminelli development who were arrested in  in a federal bidrigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from manhattan to buffalo the three men face a count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the solarcity riverbend construction contract additionally five other people have been charged with related crimes the trials will begin in late spring of  an albany firm called whitman osterman and hannah represented both lpciminelli and fort schuyler management corporation which was a subsidiary of suny polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where solarcity is being built the governors office said that the formal awarding of the solarcity contract was made by fort schuyler on behalf of the state on may   the public authorities control board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve  million in new funds for solarcity as late as may  solarcity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company the new york state legislature plans to approve a budget by april   that would give  million more into the buffalo billion program in return the legislature wants the cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent oregon attorney general investigationedit on march   the oregonian said that campaign for accountability a dcbased consumer advocacy group and other groups have asked oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels in violation of oregons unlawful trade practices act according to the oregonian the request to rosenblum singled out one company californiabased solarcity it outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by oregonians who claimed theyd been misled about costs tax credits and energy savings by the company the campaign for accountability reviewed  complaints that consumers filed with the oregon department of justice and said that the complaints indicated a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies a spokesman for the campaign for accountability said solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations leaving senior oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay plunging them into debt the oregon solar energy industry association said that it examined the complaints and found the numbers to be relatively low  lower than those being cited by the campaign for accountability solar by degree projectedit after an investigation initiated by the oregonian martin shain the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two oregon universities was indicted on two counts of firstdegree forgery by a marion county grand jury august   shain who is a consultant for bacgen technologies in seattle is a key player in the controversial  million solar by degree project and is accused of creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly  million in tax credits from the oregon department of energy the project began in  and was sponsored by the oregon university system thousands of solar panels generating millions of kilowatts of power per year were constructed on  acres on the campuses of oregon state university and the oregon institute of technology in klamath falls the states case revolves around two documents which include an invoice from solar foundations systems dated february   and a december  letter signed by ryan davies the former head of redco a utahbased company which was also the second developer on the project according to kointv the davies letter reported  had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing the solar foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays the invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state the solar by degree project ultimately received the tax credits but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice solar foundations does not exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us” customer litigationedit since  solarcity has lowered the minimum fico score required for customers to get the leasing deals it uses the score of  a “fair” credit rating as the cutoff however between  solarcity signed longterm lease agreements with at least  homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages the company has been named in  lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings in its response solarcity said in a statement to the new york times out of more than  installed customers solarcity is currently involved in  such proceedings the litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank” customer cancellation investigationedit the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating sunrun and solarcity in may  looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts some customers say they canceled contracts after being strongarmed into solarenergy deals and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general the federal government is investigating whether solar companies are masking how many customers they are losing the sec is involved because investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health according to the wall street journal to generate business solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like home depot inc according to salespeople executives and homeowners some customers say they were strongarmed into buying solarenergy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a socalled mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a homeimprovement project others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts the checks and balances projectedit solarcity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the checks and balances project the project has criticized the elected members of the arizona corporation commission the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in arizona for being too wellconnected to utility companies the checks and balances project has filed several requests for public records from the arizona corporation commission in july  the

november  solarcity and bank of america merrill lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for solarstrong energy storageedit tesla and panasonic will open the gigafactory a battery factory in nevada in  and plan to make a battery storage device called powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup the device will be sold to companies including solarcity solarcity is running a pilot project in  california houses using kilowatthour battery packs using the gridlogic software for powerwalls as a grid backup resource this concept is also being tested in vermont installation technologyedit solarcity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by zep solar which it acquired in  zep is best known for inventing a system that allows pv installers to snap together panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time zep solars technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types solar roofedit in the august  earnings call elon musk announced that solar city would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof stating it’s not a thing on a roof it is the roof as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power assorted styles of solar roof tiles made of glass were unveiled at universal studios colonial street backlot street set in late october  also unveiled was the tesla powerwall  a home battery product designed to store surplus power either from the tiles or from the grid consumer reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing governmentfunded collaborationedit the sunshot initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all americans it is run by the us department of energys solar energy technologies office and funds research development demonstration and deployment projects it is a collaboration of private companies universities state and local governments and nonprofits as well as national laboratories the program began in  with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by  by  the program achieved  of the progress towards the  goal in the fiscal year  congressional budget the program was appropriated  million according to the us department of energys appropriation request for that year the program also encourages systems integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards and tools for understanding grid integration issues solarcity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the energy departments national renewable energy laboratory and the hawaiian electric company using government and taxpayer funds solarcity helped  hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of december  litigation and investigationsedit solarcity sued salt river project an electric utility for violation of the sherman antitrust act on march   case number cv being heard before judge douglas l rayes this is in response to salt river imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panelsneeds update buffalo billionedit buffalo billion is a billiondollar program from the administration of new york gov andrew cuomo the programs intention is to revitalize buffalo new york in areas across western new york one of the main features of the program is a  million square foot solar panel factory called solarcity riverbend it will be owned by solarcity which is the largest solar provider in the united states the factory is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the western hemisphere when it opens hiring for the factory is expected in spring of  and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of  the factory will be located in an innovation hub called the hightech manufacturing innovation hub at riverbend the state appropriated  million in funding for the hub according to daily energy insider the facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about  solar panels per day solarcity is required to spend  billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than  direct manufacturing jobs as of may  federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the buffalo billion program were distributed solarcity was a partner in the program the company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the buffalo river in may  new york state officials postponed the approval of almost  million for the solarcity project according to the new york times buffalo billion will benefit a tangle of wellconnected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on buffalo billion money on april   thenus attorney preet bharara of the southern district of new york began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts buffalo billion was a part of that investigation many companies have been subpoenaed and have provided information including solarcity and the office of new york governor andrew cuomo solarcity is not the subject or focus of the investigation and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting the united states attorneys office for the southern district of new york is leading a federal inquiry into buffalo billion prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for solarcity and other components of the buffalo billion project the subpoenas sought information about how governmentfunded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the buffalo area in february three executives who worked for lpciminelli development who were arrested in  in a federal bidrigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from manhattan to buffalo the three men face a count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the solarcity riverbend construction contract additionally five other people have been charged with related crimes the trials will begin in late spring of  an albany firm called whitman osterman and hannah represented both lpciminelli and fort schuyler management corporation which was a subsidiary of suny polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where solarcity is being built the governors office said that the formal awarding of the solarcity contract was made by fort schuyler on behalf of the state on may   the public authorities control board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve  million in new funds for solarcity as late as may  solarcity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company the new york state legislature plans to approve a budget by april   that would give  million more into the buffalo billion program in return the legislature wants the cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent oregon attorney general investigationedit on march   the oregonian said that campaign for accountability a dcbased consumer advocacy group and other groups have asked oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels in violation of oregons unlawful trade practices act according to the oregonian the request to rosenblum singled out one company californiabased solarcity it outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by oregonians who claimed theyd been misled about costs tax credits and energy savings by the company the campaign for accountability reviewed  complaints that consumers filed with the oregon department of justice and said that the complaints indicated a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies a spokesman for the campaign for accountability said solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations leaving senior oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay plunging them into debt the oregon solar energy industry association said that it examined the complaints and found the numbers to be relatively low  lower than those being cited by the campaign for accountability solar by degree projectedit after an investigation initiated by the oregonian martin shain the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two oregon universities was indicted on two counts of firstdegree forgery by a marion county grand jury august   shain who is a consultant for bacgen technologies in seattle is a key player in the controversial  million solar by degree project and is accused of creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly  million in tax credits from the oregon department of energy the project began in  and was sponsored by the oregon university system thousands of solar panels generating millions of kilowatts of power per year were constructed on  acres on the campuses of oregon state university and the oregon institute of technology in klamath falls the states case revolves around two documents which include an invoice from solar foundations systems dated february   and a december  letter signed by ryan davies the former head of redco a utahbased company which was also the second developer on the project according to kointv the davies letter reported  had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing the solar foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays the invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state the solar by degree project ultimately received the tax credits but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice solar foundations does not exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us” customer litigationedit since  solarcity has lowered the minimum fico score required for customers to get the leasing deals it uses the score of  a “fair” credit rating as the cutoff however between  solarcity signed longterm lease agreements with at least  homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages the company has been named in  lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings in its response solarcity said in a statement to the new york times out of more than  installed customers solarcity is currently involved in  such proceedings the litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank” customer cancellation investigationedit the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating sunrun and solarcity in may  looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts some customers say they canceled contracts after being strongarmed into solarenergy deals and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general the federal government is investigating whether solar companies are masking how many customers they are losing the sec is involved because investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health according to the wall street journal to generate business solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like home depot inc according to salespeople executives and homeowners some customers say they were strongarmed into buying solarenergy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a socalled mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a homeimprovement project others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts the checks and balances projectedit solarcity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the checks and balances project the project has criticized the elected members of the arizona corporation commission the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in arizona for being too wellconnected to utility companies the checks and balances project has filed several requests for public records from the arizona corporation commission in july  the federal bureau of investigation interviewed the head of checks and balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain arizona statewide races in  project financing and the google fundedit solarcity partners with banks large corporations and the assetbacked market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and ppa power purchase agreement options solarcitys financing partners have included bank of america merrill lynch citi morgan stanley national bank of arizona and us bancorp among othersfull citation needed among solarcitys betterknown financing partnerships was a  million fund created with google to finance residential solar installations in june  the google fund was the largest fund of its kind in the us and googles largest investment in clean energy recently securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital solarcity offered the first us assetbacked security in the solar industry in  manufacturingedit in june  solarcity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in buffalo new york in coordination with the suny polytechnic institute after acquiring silevo a maker of highefficiency solar modules the initial manufacturing complex will be a millionsquarefoot  m facility that will cost  million and employ  workers in buffalo and  statewide with a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by  the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the us groundbreaking for the project occurred in september  with a target completion date of early  in february  ceo lyndon rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant production would begin  to  months later than planned in summer  the facility would be the largest of its kind in the western hemisphere panasonic is to handle production at the buffalo plant investing  million both panasonic and solarcitysilevo are developing similar but somewhat different hittechnology and panasonic hopes to use solarcitys inch  mm wafers combining the two companies technologies at an efficiency of  solarcity expects demand to outstrip the buffalo production of  solar panels per day and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built new york state has  days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory new york state owns the building and most of the equipment leasing it to solarcity most of the work was completed by november  when the buffalo billion project was under investigation delaying state payments to contractors

solar giant by oregonians who claimed theyd been misled about costs tax credits and energy savings by the company the campaign for accountability reviewed  complaints that consumers filed with the oregon department of justice and said that the complaints indicated a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies a spokesman for the campaign for accountability said solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations leaving senior oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay plunging them into debt the oregon solar energy industry association said that it examined the complaints and found the numbers to be relatively low  lower than those being cited by the campaign for accountability solar by degree projectedit after an investigation initiated by the oregonian martin shain the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two oregon universities was indicted on two counts of firstdegree forgery by a marion county grand jury august   shain who is a consultant for bacgen technologies in seattle is a key player in the controversial  million solar by degree project and is accused of creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly  million in tax credits from the oregon department of energy the project began in  and was sponsored by the oregon university system thousands of solar panels generating millions of kilowatts of power per year were constructed on  acres on the campuses of oregon state university and the oregon institute of technology in klamath falls the states case revolves around two documents which include an invoice from solar foundations systems dated february   and a december  letter signed by ryan davies the former head of redco a utahbased company which was also the second developer on the project according to kointv the davies letter reported  had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing the solar foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays the invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state the solar by degree project ultimately received the tax credits but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice solar foundations does not exist in addition davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the redco letter in question and that his name was forged relying on this evidence the state claims shain forged both documents shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed made up but given to him by someone else involved in the project shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court the tax credits involved were actually given to solarcity the third developer in the project along with its financial backers according to the oregonian those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits which they can use to offset their own taxes solarcity stated we financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the oregon department of energy the company argues that the state hired shain and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor treasury department inquiriesedit in  the treasury department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems the irs has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated in a  federal filing solarcity wrote “if the internal revenue service or the us treasury department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects” the firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the treasury department guidelines however a treasury department investigation or a federal audit could force solarcity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments solarcity received roughly  million in credits up until december   in solarcity’s  annual report a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made “the department of justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us” customer litigationedit since  solarcity has lowered the minimum fico score required for customers to get the leasing deals it uses the score of  a “fair” credit rating as the cutoff however between  solarcity signed longterm lease agreements with at least  homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages the company has been named in  lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings in its response solarcity said in a statement to the new york times out of more than  installed customers solarcity is currently involved in  such proceedings the litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank” customer cancellation investigationedit the securities and exchange commission sec is investigating sunrun and solarcity in may  looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts some customers say they canceled contracts after being strongarmed into solarenergy deals and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general the federal government is investigating whether solar companies are masking how many customers they are losing the sec is involved because investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health according to the wall street journal to generate business solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like home depot inc according to salespeople executives and homeowners some customers say they were strongarmed into buying solarenergy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a socalled mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a homeimprovement project others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts the checks and balances projectedit solarcity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the checks and balances project the project has criticized the elected members of the arizona corporation commission the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in arizona for being too wellconnected to utility companies the checks and balances project has filed several requests for public records from the arizona corporation commission in july  the federal bureau of investigation interviewed the head of checks and balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain arizona statewide races in  project financing and the google fundedit solarcity partners with banks large corporations

could drive solarcity corps future travis hoium tmfflushdraw sep   at pm image source getty images no matter how you slice it  has been rough for solarcity corp nasdaqscty the company has had to lower installation guidance multiple times the cost to sell solarpower systems is rising and now financing costs are going up as well amid it all solarcity has brought a transformative product to market that could drive the companys results for years to come but it hasnt gotten much attention because of tesla motors drive to buy the company and the falling stock price here is solarcitys best product of the year and why it could transform the company scty data by ycharts the new wave in rooftop solar solar leases or power purchase agreements ppa have been the dominant financing method for rooftop solar sales for many years it allows customers to put solar on their roofs for no money down and still gives them savings on their energy bill all they have to do is sign a  year agreement to buy energy from a company like solarcity  but flaws are starting to emerge in the leasingppa model solarcitys financing costs are going up and customers are starting to question whether it may save them more money to just buy a solarpower system thats led to growing market share for cash sales and solar loans over the past year solarcity saw this change coming a few years ago but its first loan product named mypower was a huge failure largely because it was complex and had a bill based on energy production in many ways it was a leaseppa in disguise earlier this year solarcity fixed that major gap in its offering and started selling solar loans to customers loans are as short as  years with a  interest rate or as long as  years with a  interest rate and it could change the companys future the good and bad of solar loans in a lot of ways loans are much better for solar installers and customers the solar installer gets cash upfront and doesnt have to take on the financing risk a lease or ppa comes with in solarcitys case it gets all of the revenue from building the solarpower system upfront which could help it become cash flow positive far more quickly than the leaseppa model for the customer he or she can take advantage of tax benefits and the solarpower system becomes an asset when he or she sells their home a leaseppa is by definition a liability he or she hopes a new homeowner will take on the downside is that its much easier to compare the cost of solarpower systems being bought with cash or a loan solarcity doesnt have a product differentiation from competitors and uses many of the same components a local installer may use so now its competing on cost solar loans could be solarcitys future solarcity needs to show that it can generate cash and become profitable which is why loans will be key for the company particularly if the tesla motors deal falls through more upfront cash may come with lower margins but thats better than seeing financing costs soar strangling the business a few years from now solarcity may be a solar loan company which would be a huge strategic shift from where it is today and that would be good news for investors longterm
