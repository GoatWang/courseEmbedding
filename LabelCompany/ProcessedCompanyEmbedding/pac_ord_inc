were invited by the naval supply center in oakland california to submit their best and final offers kirkmayer bid  and pac ord bid   as stated the  navelex contract for a threeyear term was awarded to pac ord ii issues under wellestablished rules governing the grant or denial of such motions eg simon v united states  fd   th cir the issues presented by pac ords motion for summary judgment on the §  claims are whether on the uncontroverted facts as a matter of law  pac ord does not possess monopoly power in the relevant market so as to defeat kirkmayers monopolization claim  the dangerous probability of success element is absent so as to preclude kirkmayers attempt to monopolize claim iii discussion a section  monopoly power the elements of a §  monopolization claim are well established see eg aspen skiing co v aspen highlands skiing corp  us   s ct    l ed d   one essential element is defendants possession of monopoly power  the power to control prices or exclude competition in the relevant market eg greyhound computer corp v international business mach corp  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   in this case the definition of the relevant market is controverted i accept for purposes of ruling on defendants motion plaintiffs contention of the relevant market plaintiffs marketing expert has defined the services market as the market for five specific interrelated types of maintenance repair installation and fabrication services for navy electronics equipment navelex blue collar services he has defined the geographic market as the area within a mile radius of the navys facility at vallejo california thus plaintiffs definition of the relevant market is limited to the services rendered under the navelex contract awarded to defendant and four peripheral contracts for similar services at vallejo the question then is did pac ord possess monopoly power in this market few cases have analyzed market power in this context ie an exclusive fixedprice government contractor for a fixed term the recent case of national reporting co v alderson reporting co  fd  th cir involved sherman act §  charges against the successful bidder for the court reporting services contract of the united states tax court as in the case at bench defendant alderson underbid plaintiff national who had held the contract for several years prior thereto there the contracts were only for oneyear terms however unlike the case at bench the tax courts policy was to allow the incumbent contractor to renew the contract if it agreed to do so at no increase in price and was rendering satisfactory services thus the eighth circuit observed that alderson could not control prices because if it tried to raise its price the contract would again be up for bids id at  further there were other courtreporting companies who can bid and try to undercut the company holding the contract id thus there also was no power in the incumbent contractor to exclude competition here the absence of monopoly power is even clearer like national reporting the navelex contract here is for a fixed term at a fixed price there is no power to exclude any competitor from bidding on the contract the uncontroverted evidence is that there are numerous firms capable of bidding on the navelex contract and that nonincumbency was not a competitive disadvantage here however unlike national  reporting the incumbent holder of the navelex contract including pac ord could not extend the contract by agreeing not to raise its price national reporting is indistinguishable i agree with its holding that in the circumstances of this case  a government contractor who obtains the contract for a fixed term at a fixed price in open bidding against a number of other bidders  the contractor does not have the power to control prices or exclude competition kirkmayer attempts to distinguish the case at bench factually from national reporting on the basis that the navelex contract is only one of five blue collar services contracts at vallejo and because it is the largest the holder of the navelex contract also referred to as the buildtoprint contract exercises monopoly power over the other four contracts in  two of these contracts were awarded to kirkmayer and the remaining two to a third company according to plaintiff without the buildtoprint contract kirkmayer was unable to service the two contracts and relinquished them to navelex the third company also relinquished its two contracts since then these services also have been provided by pac ord thus plaintiff argues that defendant by predatory below cost pricing gained a monopoly over the relevant market which includes all five contracts the argument is unpersuasive national reportings analysis would apply regardless of whether the government chose to offer for bidding the navelex work in one two five or any other number of contracts in substance kirkmayers contention is that all five blue collar contracts should be treated as a single integrated economic unit ie that scale economies made it uneconomical for a contractor to attempt to perform any of the remaining four navelex contracts without the base of the buildtoprint or navelex contract which was far larger than any of the others kirkmayer in fact refers to the remaining four contracts as peripheral contracts thus kirkmayers complaint concerning the remaining contracts does not depend on how the navelex contract was obtained by the successful bidder since under kirkmayers theory scale economies dictate that award of the four peripheral contracts will always follow the award of the navelex contract economic realities dictate that the five contracts be treated as one thus the gist of kirkmayers §  complaint is exclusion from the navelex contract b section  attempt to monopolize the eighth circuit also held in national reporting that because of the defendants inability to raise prices without undergoing another bidding process under the §  attempt claim there was never a dangerous probability of success  fd at  in this circuit also a dangerous probability of success is one of the three elements of an attempt claim under section  of the sherman act william inglis  sons baking co v itt continental baking co  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   here too because it was a shortterm fixed price contractor pac ord could not raise prices or exclude competition thus even assuming that pac ords bid was below its average variable costs or  marginal costs it is highly doubtful that such pricing was predatory since pac ord could not reap predations benefitssee national reporting  fd at  inglis  fd at  the uncontroverted facts indicate that at this time there are  firms in addition to the parties here capable of bidding on the navelex contract ie actual or potential competitors pac ord obviously cannot exclude any of those firms from bidding on the contract when its present term expires in the meantime under the contract it is incapable of raising its price in this uncontroverted factual circumstance there never could be a dangerous probability of success therefore summary judgment appropriately also is granted on kirkmayers §  attempt to monopolize claim c pendent state claims kirkmayers complaint also asserts pendent claims under california law for violation of the cartwright act cal bus  profcode §  et seq and for violation of the unfair practices act id at §  et seq defendants have moved for summary judgment on these claims as well or in the alternative that they be dismissed pursuant to the courts discretion under umw v gibbs  us    s ct    l ed d   here since all federal claims will now be dismissed that factor weighs heavily in exercising the courts discretion under gibbs when federal claims are dismissed before trial the question whether pendent state claims should still be entertained is within the sound discretion of the district court generally dismissal of federal claims before trial dictates that the pendent state claims should also be dismissed schultz v sundberg  fd   th cir citations omitted one situation where dismissal of state claims is proper is when the state issues apparently predominate wren v sletten constr co  fd   th cir  however it may be proper to retain jurisdiction over state law claims after dismissal of all federal claims see in re nucorp energy sec litig  fd   th cir here it is useful to treat the two pendent claims separately  cartwright act the basis of the summary judgment motion on the cartwright act claim is that it should be controlled by this courts earlier grant of summary judgment in defendants favor on the sherman act §  claim that ruling was predicated on the uncontroverted showing of defendants that no conspiracy agreement or other concerted action had been shown the uncontroverted facts on the issue of the existence of a conspiracy have not changed since the courts grant of summary judgment to defendants on the §  claim the cartwright act like the sherman act requires a trust combination or some other form of joint conduct cal bus  profcode §  in fact the cartwright act is patterned upon the federal sherman act and  hence federal cases interpreting the sherman act are applicable with respect to the cartwright act chicago title ins co v great w fin corp  cal d    cal rptr   pd   plaintiff in fact virtually has conceded on this issue and does not argue against summary judgment on the cartwright act claim thus because the issue is identical to the sherman act §  issue previously decided i exercise my discretion to determine this claim on the merits see bright v bechtel petroleum inc  fd   th cir proper to decide pendent claim after dismissal of federal claim where both state and federal claims involved the same issue i grant defendants summary judgment motion on this claim for the same reason the §  claim was dismissed earlier  although summary judgment is not ordinarily favored on this type of issue absence of conspiracy and plaintiff is permitted to rely on circumstantial evidence the plaintiff is required to come forward with some support for its allegation program engg v triangle publications  fd   th cir  here defendants have rebutted with probative evidence every inference that plaintiff would ask the court to draw they have denied the alleged conspiracy and offered reasonable explanations for all of the circumstances that plaintiff suggests are suspicious even viewing plaintiffs evidence in the most favorable light plaintiff has failed sufficiently to rebut defendants evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact id accordingly defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the §  claim memo order dec    unfair practices act the complaint also alleges a claim under the california unfair practices act calbus  profcode §  et seq this act inter alia prohibits sales below cost cal bus  profcode §  as noted earlier the predatory conduct alleged in this case  sales below cost  is a controverted issue of fact the unfair practices act unlike the cartwright act does not mirror federal law it may proscribe conduct permitted under federal law see inglis  fd at  therefore since questions of fact remain and because state law analysis differs from the federal claims the cases counsel that discretion should be exercised in favor of dismissal without prejudice iv conclusion for the reasons stated the court grants defendants motion for summary judgment on the second claim both for monopolization and attempt to monopolize and on the third claim for violation of the cartwright act the court exercises its discretion under gibbs to dismiss the fourth claim for violation of the california unfair practices act without prejudice to its being pursued in state court notes  the court earlier granted defendants motion for partial summary judgment on plaintiffs claim under §  of the sherman act the uncontroverted facts were that there was no conspiracy agreement or other concerted action see discussion in part iiic infra  by accepting this definition for purposes of ruling on the pending motion because it is a controverted issue of fact the court does not indicate its approval of it rather the court is quite skeptical of the proffered market definition see eg twin city sportservice v charles o finley  co  fd   th cir  minor exceptions to the fixed price concept do not materially affect the characterization of the contract as a fixed price contract  as the discussion in inglis indicates there is some uncertainty about the meaning of this requirement see id at  what appears to be an aberrant statement is made in forro precision inc v international business mach corp  fd   th cir that this circuit has rejected the premise that probability of actual monopolization is an essential element of proof of attempt to monopolize however this statement has been treated as referring to something other than the dangerous probability of success element see aurora enter inc v national broadcasting co  fd   th cir moreover the more recent cases continue to follow the claims formulation set forth in inglis see eg de modena v kaiser found health plan inc  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   airweld inc v airco inc  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   thus it is clear that the requirement continues to exist in this circuit  this circumstance also casts doubt on whether plaintiff can prove the existence of specific intent see inglis  fd at   although not alleged in its complaint on the motion plaintiff takes the position that the fourth claim is also susceptible of being read as stating a claim under the unfair competition statutes calbus  profcode §  et seq in view of the disposition of this claim it is unnecessary to reach the issue of whether a statutory unfair competition claim has been adequately alleged  the court notes that a state court action has been pending between the parties since  and that unfair competition claims are asserted in that action even without such a pending action no statute of limitations problems should be encountered because of californias application of the equitable tolling doctrine to pendent claims dismissed under gibbs see mattson v city of costa mesa  cal
