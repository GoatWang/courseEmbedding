michigan regulators to review nexus before issuing order related products forward look with premium data ngis bidweek alert north american natural gas pipelines  shaleresource plays  edition regulators in michigan agreed with an administrative law judges finding that plans by dte electric co to contract with nexus gas transmission llc to buy natural gas for power generation appear reasonable and prudent despite the pipeline being partly owned by a utility affiliate but the michigan public service commission psc also conceded that plans by dte energy co to jointly develop the mile pipeline with spectra energy corp represented perhaps the greatest area of controversy in the proceedings and denied the utility permission to recover power supply costs for the  billion project from its customers the nexus pipeline would move  bcfd of marcellus and utica shale gas from eastern ohio into michigan connecting appalachian gas to markets in the midwest and canada it received a favorable draft environmental impact statement eis from ferc last july in an order last thursday case no u the psc approved dte electrics power supply cost recovery plan for the  calendar year at a factor of  centskwh the commission also accepted the utilitys fiveyear forecast covering  through  of projected power supply requirements and the cost of that supply the psc said it supports the proposal for decision issued by administrative law judge dennis mack last october and would adopt his findings but the commission added that the issues raised by the intervenors merit the close and thorough discussion undertaken in this proceeding the intervenors include anr pipeline co environmental groups and the states attorney general dte energys participation in the proposed pipeline appeared to be at the very root of the many objections presented by the intervenors the psc said resolute allegations of violation of the state code of conduct lack of arms length negotiations failure to consider viable alternative pipeline companies failure to obtain economic pricing and failure to have an appropriately transparent contractual process were vehemently denied by dte electric the commission added that it finds that costs associated with nexus should not be recoverable absent a transparent evidentiary presentation examining the full nature of the nexus arrangements only under such circumstances will the commission be prepared to determining the viability of said costs according to psc records in its initial application in september  dte electric requested approval of a uniform monthly maximum power supply cost recovery factor of  millskwh for its customers mack noted that dte electric estimated that it would need more than  million kwh to meet its customers needs in  and total system power supply costs would be  billion including total base transmission costs of  million in  anr a subsidiary of transcanada corp proposed building the anr east project a scalable multipart project that would transport shale gas from the marcellus and utica shales to the midwest gulf coast and ontario through multiple pipeline interconnections the nexus pipeline is also in competition with the mile rover pipeline which would follow a similar route and bring  bcfd of natural gas from the appalachian basin to michigan rover backed by energy transfer partners lp received a final eis from the federal energy regulatory commission last july and awaits a final authorization decision last year dte energy announced plans to retire eight coalfired generation units in michigan over the next seven years replacing them with a mix of generation including natural gas and renewables it also announced plans to invest up to  billion to replace coalfired plants by  the company also
