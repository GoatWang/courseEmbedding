the big deal about stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine the big deal about stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine microcapspeculatorscom news commentary news provided by microcapspeculatorscom  et share this article las vegas july   prnewswire  stem cell therapies are a key component of the regenerative medicine field that promises to be a revolutionary approach to treating many degenerative conditions by repairing damaged tissue and harnessing the bodys ability to heal itself biotech companies in focus include endonovo therapeutics inc otcqb endv pulse biosciences inc nasdaq plse pluristem therapeutics inc nasdaq psti cytori therapeutics inc nasdaq cytx and capricor therapeutics inc nasdaq capr however when looking at this great promise in terms of return on investment let us be completely honest most early stage stem cell investors have lost their shirts we are now more than twenty years removed from the earliest commercial stem cell companies that were founded in the late s went public in the late s and who were once seen as an exciting investment opportunity but ended up being a huge disappointment  so should investors still be interested in regenerative medicine after all stem cells have largely produced failures and unregulated stem cell clinics marketing unproven therapies are taking over the answer is a resounding yes but the dotcom like era of regenerative medicine which led investors to pour money into anything and anyone marketing a cell therapy is over investors will need to look at companies solving issues with stem cells or those taking a completely new approach one company that is looking to address many of the issues with stem cell therapies as well as developing another approach to regenerative medicine is endonovo therapeutics inc otcqb endv on the stem cell front endv is using its time varying electromagnetic fields tvemf technology originally developed at the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to expand and activate stem cells to produce more biologically potent cell therapies however more importantly endv is developing a noninvasive medical device that would render many of the cell therapies currently under development obsolete these devices called electroceuticals harness the electrical signals that our cells and nerves use to control the immune and regenerative response to treat inflammatory and degenerative diseases endv is developing this exciting technology for treating and preventing heart failure following a heart attack to treat chronic kidney disease peripheral artery disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash another small biotech company like endv working on electric treatments for diseases is pulse biosciences nasdaq plse whose nanopulse stimulation nps technology uses nano second electric pulses to illicit an immune response for the treatment of cancer plse recently announced the treatment of its first patient in a study to evaluate

to address past pitfalls of stem cell therapies is pluristem therapeutics inc nasdaq psti is a developer of placentabased cell therapy product candidates for the treatment of multiple ischemic inflammatory and hematologic conditions pluristems products include plxpad and plx r the companys plx cells are adherent stromal cells ascs that are expanded using a three dimensional d process the

and potent cells that can secrete therapeutic biomolecules the companys plx products are administered using a standard needle and syringe psti recently announced that austrias regulatory health agency the austrian agency for health and food safety ages had cleared pluristem to begin enrollment in austria for its pivotal phase iii trial of plxpad cells to treat critical limb ischemia in other stem cell news cytori therapeutics inc nasdaq cytx recently announced that its star study assessing its habeo cell therapy for the treatment of scleroderma had failed to meet its primary endpoint at week

physicianbased stem cell therapies for human and animal patients has received reactivation status of the marvel phase iiiii trial following the passing of the st century cures act us stem cell inc has applied to the fda for regenerative medicine advanced therapy rmat designation for the myocell product as part of the marvel trial  our trial had previously been placed on “inactive status” as patients were not actively being enrolled  we placed a request to the fda to reactivate the protocol and consider the therapy for rmat designation  we have recently heard from the fda who has notified us that the protocol has been placed on “reactivation status” after reviewing details on the protocol and data collected on patients to date  the fda has also notified us that they are still reviewing our submission for rmat  thanks to the regrow component of the cures act the fda will grant rmat designation for a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat modify reverse or cure a serious or lifethreatening disease and demonstrates preliminary clinical evidence that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a disease  we believe that our myocell product meets these requirements as we have demonstrated clinical efficacy in both preclinical and clinical studies including our most recent marvel trial publication review full publication here httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed  if rmat designation is granted this could expedite the approval process with the fda more information on the fda’s new rmat designation can be found

youth arsabsettitle  july    melissa porter a scientist holding a mousesource patrick semansky ap there is hope that this breakthrough will pave the way for new strategies that delay or prevent diseases related to the aging process so while figuring out more precisely what these cells are doing the end result from that wont be a formula for youth the details of the findings were recently published in naturethe hypothalamus was always known to regulate important bodily functions including growth development reproduction and metabolism the research was conducted in the bronxs albert einstein college of medicinethese results are strongly suggestive that stem cells in the hypothalamus play a key role in modulating the aging processnow in a followup study the researchers think theyve pinpointed the particular cells in the hypothalamus that matter here neural stem cells which serve to generate replacements for dead and damaged cellsin what david sinclair who studies aging at harvard medical school and who was not involved in the work calls a herculean effort the researchers discovered that stem cells in the hypothalamus of the mouse play a role in overall health and life span he tells the scientist we need to be aware that this process in multi layered and that everything from diet to hormones going to affect our rate of aging it was also determined the effects of the loss can be reversedthis lead to questions about whether injecting new stem cells could slow or reverse ageing and it did lp nysekkr price target raised to  at oppenheimer holdings inc initially they had to modify the stem cells to initiate an antiinflammatory pathway in the mice by old age  about two years of age in mice  most of those cells were gone says dr cai this is several months ahead of the point when the typical signs of aging begin to manifestto test the effects of the exosomes alone on aging the researchers purified the vesicles from cultured hypothalamic neural stem cells and transplanted them into middleaged mice finding that the exosometreated mice aged more slowly than vehicletreated controlsaccording to him if the stem cells are destroyed the aging of the mice gets faster the disruption dramatically accelerated the aging process compared to mice in the control group mice with ablated hypothalamic stem cells also died earlier than control micein the future scientists could be capable of editing our brains to help us live longer both groups exhibited a slowing or complete reversal of aging measures this is a normal aging process where the neural stem cells that produce key factors start dropping in numbers in the hypothalamic neural stem cells the researchers detected exosomessecreted vesicles that can contain rna and proteinscontaining a variety of mirnas short rna molecules that inhibit the expression of targeted genesthe next step was to inject hypothalamus stem cells into the brains of mice whose own supply of the cells had been destroyed as well as normal old miceto see if an opposite effect was also possible  in other words whether stocking up on neural stem cells could produce youthful vigour and longevity  the team injected

inc products myocell us stem cell’s lead product candidate is myocell® a muscle stem cell therapy that is intended to improve cardiac function months or even years after a patient has suffered severe heart damage due to a heart attack the procedure involves a physician removing a small amount of muscle from the patient’s thigh from this muscle specimen muscle stem cells also called myoblasts are then isolated expanded using us stem cell’s proprietary cellculturing process and injected directly into the scar tissue of the patient’s heart the cells are delivered by an endoventricular needleinjection catheter during a minimally invasive procedure performed by an interventional cardiologist or vascular surgeon the muscle stem cells populate the regions of scar tissue and are intended to improve cardiac function by helping the heart muscle beat more efficiently the results of our clinical trial marvel part  were published in the american heart journal the prominent peer reviewed medical journal when compared with placebo myoblast therapy was associated with sustained six months improvements in six minute walk distance of  meters a clinically meaningful improvement for congestive heart failure patients this translates into returning to a more active lifestyle and a better quality of life proposed use autologous muscle stem cell therapy for the treatment of severe heart damage in heart failure patients statusphase phase i phase iii and phase ii trials completed phase iiiii underway myocell sdf myocell sdf has received approval from the fda to begin human clinical trials and is intended to be an improvement to myocell the myoblast cells to be injected are genemodified prior to injection by an adenovirus vector so that they will release extra quantities of stromal derived factor –  or sdf protein following injury which results in inadequate blood flow to the heart such as a heart attack the human body naturally increases the level of sdf protein in the heart by modifying the myoblasts to express sdf prior to injection the levels of sdf proteins in the heart can be increased the presence of additional quantities of sdf protein released by the myoblasts may stimulate the recruitment of the patient’s existing stem cells to the cell transplanted area and thereafter the recruited stem cells will assist in the tissue repair and blood vessel formation process in preclinical studies myocell sdf provided a  percent improvement of heart function compared to  percent for the original myocell composition while the placebo control treated animals declined by  percent the preclinical studies also demonstrated that this product candidate can enhance blood vessel formation in damaged hearts proposed use autologous cell therapy treatment

rejuvenation organ regeneration and tissue healing read more how does stem cell therapy plus work stem cell therapy plus uses the same principle as traditional stem cell therapy but with much less cost less risk yet similar or more effectiveness stem cell therapy plus starts with the selection of specific organ cells from an animal fetus unborn young bred specifically for this purpose many years of experience have shown that sheep are the best donor animals because they are vital hardy animals with the best immune systems and natural disease resistance sheep proteins are particularly compatible with the human body and trigger no immune reactions in stem cell therapy plus these vigorous young stem cells with their vital life force still active are ingested into a human host via hightech softgel bioactive stem cell pe capsules since stem cells have no antigens they are not recognized as foreign by the host body according to dr niehans’ proven theory they circulate from the site of ingestion small intestines until they recognize and congregate at the human counterpart of the organ from which they were taken – pancreas cells go to the pancreas brain cells go to the brain nerves cells go to the nerves cartilage cells go to the cartilages heart cells go to the heart etc these young stem cells which are functionally organ specific but not species specific imprint their vigor upon old tired and degenerating cells stimulating them to function with renewed efficiency the organ itself then retains its vigor and vitality in addition to effectively stimulate the cells of specific organ systems these new and energetic stem cells act quickly to revitalize the body immune system  defense mechanisms when damage occurs to the cells that make up the various tissues and organs involved in the immune systems either through the ageing process or from environmental poisons the body becomes defenseless against both external invasion and internal degeneration damage to specific organs and immune system may be reversed through revitalization  regeneration with stem cell therapy plus anecdotal evidence shows that through the usage of stem cell therapy plus
