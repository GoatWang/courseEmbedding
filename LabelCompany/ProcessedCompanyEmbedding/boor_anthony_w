our call today im pleased to report that we had a solid start to  the market remains very strong the pace of innovation were delivering is unmatched in our industry and were seeing very positive traction with our nextgeneration cloud solutions weve carried the positive momentum from last year into  with full year financial guidance that improves upon last years performance and implies achievement of our longterms aspirational goals as usual tony will provide more detail on our financial results and ill provide an update in the context of our fourpoint growth strategy so lets get started the first of our four growth strategies is integrated and open solutions in the cloud blackbaud sky our new modern cloud platform continuous to rapidly evolve with thousands of updates since becoming generally available in  blackbaud sky combines infrastructure processes and preintegrated services like payments analytics reporting and our artificial intelligence to deliver total solutions allowing our customers to achieve their highest potential we just publicly introduced sky ai or artificial intelligence recently but weve been embedding artificial intelligence and advanced analytical capabilities into our cloud software for several years now sky ai is the artificial intelligence engine behind the growing number of insights integrated into blackbaud cloud software solutions powered by machine learning positive technology natural language processing predictive analytics and other advanced technologies were enabling datadriven decisions by pairing the industrys largest dataset with the industrys most advanced set of ai capabilities ultimately having greater impact on our customers and their missions so why is blackbaud different in this area of analytics and artificial intelligence we dont simply provide our customers a set of tools we design and deliver complete solutions specific to customer needs for example we just rolled out blackbaud healthcare analytics which allows healthcare institutions to undercover new customers engage existing patients and deepen relationships with supporters and constituents additionally what is unique in this area of ai and analytics because we have the largest proprietary data set that we include with these solutions were also continuing down the path of modernizing our solution portfolio and moving it onto blackbaud sky platform the next generation of luminate online for example is currently underway at the end of  we made sky reporting available to  of our luminate online customers enabling them to leverage an entirely new and fullyintegrated set of business intelligence tools since then we steadily introduced new features and capabilities like geolocation services and preintegrated social insight capabilities to name just a few the pace of innovation were now delivering to the market is unprecedented and we continue to receive high marks from the industry trustradius recently published a report collecting feedback from roughly  of our customers and concluded that raisers edge nxt is the first and only truly comprehensive cloudbased solution built specifically for the needs of the nonprofit community this report is available for your reference on our investor relations website its a very solid thirdparty independent paper on how unique we are in the space now lets turn to our second strategy which is to drive sales effectiveness weve created a new head of sales position and promoted patrick hodges from our general markets group to lead this effort across the organization patrick has been with blackbaud for over  years and has successfully led the largest sales organization in the company for the last several years he knows how to develop a worldclass field sales and support organization hes hired and developed some of the best sales leaders in the companys history and he knows how to compete and win patrick now reports directly to me and he is the executive leader in the continued creation of a worldclass sales organization at blackbaud to drive healthy topline growth and penetrate our large and expanding total addressable market which today stands at over  billion we framed the tam opportunity into three categories the migration of our maintenance space to subscriptions with nxt the existing crosssell opportunity into our own base which is even more significant and new customer sales which is the most significant opportunity for us over the last two years weve been better aligning our sales team to capitalize on these opportunities bifurcating the sales organization into hunters and farmers focusing hunters exclusively on new customers and farmers exclusively on base customers as we grow the sales force we anticipate shifting the balance towards hunters which better aligns us with the market opportunity were also improving market coverage by deploying sales head count into the field and were focused on enabling our outstanding sales teams with training processes and tools to improve effectiveness and drive revenue growth and were progressively moving towards prescriptive solution offerings by subvertical including k private schools foundations corporations arts and cultural higher education and healthcare the move to selling preintegrated solutions suites instead of individual point solutions has been successful and were furthering our goto market shift with a concentrated focus by subvertical now lets move to our third strategy which is tam expansion our approach is to expand tam into new or near adjacencies with acquisitions and product investments last month we announced the promotion of jagtar narula the senior vice president of corporate strategy and business development replacing charlie cumbaa who has recently retired from blackbaud after a long and very successful career id like to thank charlie for his leadership and stewardship over the years so youre aware jagtar led the effort for the acquisitions of whipplehill microedge smart tuition attentively and most recently academicworks which closed at the beginning of q academicworks is the market leader in scholarship management software for higher education institutions foundations and k private schools the cloud platform enables students to apply for all awards at an institution using one intuitive and streamlined process while offering schools and awarding institutions a common platform for improved awarding reporting compliance communication and stewardship of those awards this fits squarely within our acquisition criteria to expand tam into near adjacencies fuel revenue growth improve profitability and accelerate our move to the cloud we remain active in the evaluation of acquisition opportunities to broaden our portfolio be in a position to provide better integrated solutions for our customers differentiate us from the competition and accelerate our financial performance our final strategic initiative is to improve operating efficiency which is focused on delivering improved annual operating margin theres significant opportunity ahead to drive further improvement while leveraging the infrastructure investments weve made in the back office for scale focus on operational excellence and furthering our productivity initiative we expect to achieve our aspirational goal in  based on the midpoint of our financial guidance and its important to note this improvement is inclusive of heightened investments to fuel future growth which we believe will ultimately result in greater shareholder value over the longterm overall im very pleased with our start to  execution against our fourpoint growth strategy is resulting in solid financial performance widening the competitive moat between blackbaud and the competition and ultimately delivering greater value for our customer our business continues to strengthen and we have a very positive outlook for the remainder of  ill now turn the call over to tony to cover our financial performance in greater detail before we open up for qa tony anthony w boor  blackbaud inc thanks mike and good morning everyone im pleased to report that we had a very solid start to the year positioning us well to achieve our fullyear financial guidance ill direct you to yesterdays press release and the investor materials posted in our website for the full detail of our q financial performance today ill focus on the key highlights so we can get to your questions our first quarter revenue was  million an increase of  on an organic basis over  recurring revenue continues to climb representing  of our total revenue which is  basis points higher than q of  and  growth on an organic basis recurring organic revenue growth is a key metric for us as it represents the core of the business and will continue to grow as a percentage of total revenue as we further our shift towards subscriptionbased recurring revenue subscriptions accounted for roughly  of total revenue in q which is a  basis point improvement over q of  representing revenue growth of roughly  on an organic basis subscriptions continue to exhibit strong performance as we move to integrated and open solutions in the cloud and shift our midmarket customers to nxt we remain pleased with the market traction todate and the economics of shifting customers to nextgeneration cloud solutions in a subscription model weve combined services revenue with licenses and other which declined  versus q of  and represented  of our total revenue consulting services drove the yearoveryear decline which is in accordance with our strategy given were shifting our offerings toward innovative and modern cloud solutions requiring less implementation and customization services our services revenue is declining faster than we originally anticipated for  were expecting to be down yearoveryear both as a percentage of total revenue and a dollar basis which aligns with our strategy turning to profitability our gross margin was  which is a  basis point improvement over q  we generated operating income of  million representing an operating margin of  and diluted earnings per share of  execution against our operating efficiency initiative continues to result in improved profitability while we are simultaneously making increased investments into the business to drive longterm growth moving to cash flow statement and balance sheet our q free cash flow was  million an increase of  million when compared to recast q  we continued making necessary innovation and infrastructure investments to support our move to the cloud amounting to  million in capex for property and equipment and  million for capitalized software development were expecting the total amount of software capitalization to start leveling off in  after a ramp over the last several years and the amount we are capitalizing is now roughly equal to the amount of amortization having a relatively neutral impact to the pl we also paid out  million in cash dividends to shareholders during the quarter and ended with  million in net debt our capital strategy calls for a debttoebitda ratio of less than  times and at the end of q we stood at  times the  million acquisition of academicworks closed on april  and was financed with debt were expecting a positive but relatively immaterial impact in  from the acquisition given the relative size of academicworks in comparison to our total business we will not be updating our fullyear financial guidance and expect any incremental upside to be captured within our originally issued guidance ranges were guiding to nongaap revenue of  million to  million nongaap operating income of  million to  million nongaap operating margin of  to  nongaap diluted earnings per share of  to  and nongaap free cash flow from  million to  million ill note that our free cash flow expectation is particularly strong when taking into account that we are now a full cash taxpayer and estimate  million to  million in incremental cash taxes for the year and overall our  financial guidance allows us to achieve our longterm aspirational goals first introduced back in  we are currently evaluating the impact of asc  which we plan to adopt in  based on our early evaluation we currently expect the largest financial impact to relate to deferral of commission expense we expect to defer a greater amount of commissions for a longer period of time using customer life versus our current practice of using the average initial contractor we also expect limited impact to revenue associated with the allocation of transaction prices per contracts but we still sell perpetual software licenses we will continue to keep you updated on the anticipated impact however at this stage the impact from a financial perspective appears to be largely positive finally ill point out that this quarter weve made an optical change to our pl by combining licenses and other services giving the inventory reality and comparison to our recurring revenues in summary continued execution against our strategic plan is allowing us to strengthen the business and improve underlying fundamentals of the company were maintaining our disciplined approach to balance investments that drive growth with improved profitability and we will continue to execute on our capital deployment strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet return capital to shareholders and create growth and scalability with that id like to open up the line for your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you well pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions and well go first to tom roderick with stifel tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc gentlemen good morning michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc good morning tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks for taking my question hey mike can i ask you the first question just about the sales structure these days you have some interesting comments there talking about how you see a bigger opportunity from new customers at this point and i think a lot of us have been thinking more about the opportunity on the installed base and what you can do to upsell them and crosssell them and that certainly sounds like it still exists but talk to us a little if you dont mind just about what that means from a profitability perspective thinking about new customers sometimes taking longer and become less profitable as your installed base is long to kind of come up the speed with the asps that your existing installed customers are used to i love to hear a little bit more about how that progression plays out both from a growth and margin perspective michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc sure tom we announced that patrick hodges is now reporting to me and heading the sales effort globally and his project that is part of our fourpoint strategy that we introduced awhile back and this is just a continuation of the program we still have a tremendous opportunity for backtobase to the installed base and for crossselling theres a big opportunity a lot of run way there theres also a big opportunity for net new customers and weve been making that change incrementally over the last  to  months where if you go back a couple of years and we had very mixed territories where the old sales executives and whole teams might have both backtobase and responsibility for net new logos and weve separated those out largely in either geographic territories or goto market so we have teams that are hunters only if you will going after net new logos and then teams that are crossselling into the base which remains a tremendous opportunity so its not a shift in strategy its just a continuing investment and maturation of the sales function in the company at a bit of a faster pace because of the opportunity that we see ahead of us it doesnt diminish the crosssell opportunity at all its still significantly there tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc perfect thank you tony quick followup just on the academicworks acquisition there i think some people are going to ask you about why not update guidance for it i understand its early in the year but perhaps you could just add some more parameters around what  million bought you there how we ought to think about what ends up in the preferred writedown scenario versus actually getting the gaap revenue and then can you get to why you didnt choose to update your guidance relative to something that probably has – or at least a little bit of contribution to the top line thanks anthony w boor  blackbaud inc sure tom as you say it was a  million acquisition that happened in the first part of q we paid a reasonable multiple like weve done i think with most of our recent transactions but not the anticipated revenue and margin impact rest of the year compared to the size of the rest of the business is not material and would fit within our previously provided guidance range and so we just chose not to update at this point in time i think the other thing wed say is that wed expect it to be accretive from an earnings perspective as well operator and well take our next question from justin furby with william blair justin a furby  william blair  co llc hey guys good morning thanks i want to start mike with you on the sales investments that youve done layering in over the last several quarters i just wonder if you could share anything in terms of if youre seeing anything in terms of pipeline growth or bookings growth or any type of forward metric that maybe we cant see and then tony you posted i think  recurring growth in q organic is that sort of the right way to think about the full year organically thanks michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc sure ill take the first part we used what i would describe as all the right modern metrics for understanding productivity and ramp up and cost ratios and time to quota that we put in awhile back and so these head count ramp ups and you in the k that we went up by about  in head count last year these are done with an eye towards high productivity and the building of future opportunities related to bookings and revenue growth and what have you so yeah i mean we better get better performance right because were adding head count and its quite measured as well so were excited about the fact that we spent the last couple of years and were not quite done but really modernizing the product portfolio through a lot of integration the whole sky architecture big focus on ai and analytics its been going on for years and the impact of our solutions in the market are significant and its just a build on of again the maturing and the growth of the sales function in a very large addressable market so were excited about what that holds for the future and thats really all about the announcements around patrick anthony w boor  blackbaud inc then justin on organic recurring revenue growth youve hit on a very positive trend in  we were about just over  growth that ramped to about  last year and weve seen continued acceleration through q of this year up to almost  at  we dont guide to that so i cant give you any future color as to what wed expect on the year we held our full year guidance the one thing we did see in the quarter as you can see by looking at the numbers and in our prepared comments is that our services and other revenue the nonrecurring side of the business actually fell off a little more than we anticipated when we originally gave guidance at the end of the year we had suggested that services in dollars was going to be relatively flat yearoveryear we actually saw a bit of decline there and anticipate that that would continue through the rest of the year which means weve seen a little better than expected performance overall with the recurring revenue because were still running right in line with our expectation so i think thats a positive move from a mix perspective and right in line with our strategy that services continues to decline because were moving more quickly to the cloud i mean less customization less implementation service more out of the box configuration et cetera so thats a very positive mix for us justin a furby  william blair  co llc got it thank you very much michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc and ill just add that you could see the strategy of the company sort of manifest itself in the revenue shift thats happening with services and maintenance going backwards which is basically unite toward the success of selling the subscription model and the organic growth in the subscription line is really just a manifestation of the strategy coming to bear so its positive justin a furby  william blair  co llc thank you very much michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc youre welcome anthony w boor  blackbaud inc thanks buddy operator and well go next to ben mcfadden with pacific crest securities ben mcfadden  pacific crest securities hey guys thanks for taking my question mike i want to start with k market especially in light of this academicworks acquisition i was curious as far as kind of what traction youre seeing there and any metrics you can provide as far as sort of the amount of solution – average solutions to customer base as now versus what they would have had say maybe two years ago or any other way that we can kind of think about your traction in that k market would be great michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc yeah sure so academicworks for us is just a perfect fit i cant tell you how many times were out in the market and customers are asking us why dont we do scholarship management and these guys have built a really solid cloud modern tech cloud platform that addresses a very big problem in the industry and it covers actually three of our markets it covers higher ed it covers foundations and it covers the higher end of the k school market to your question so its a nice natural fit for us from an adjacency standpoint in multiple markets that are currently addressed by our teams specifically the k yeah were covering quite a bit of that market today from an application standpoint if you go back a couple of years we might have provided fundraising for a k school and you look today and were covering much of the total it spend in a school from student enrollment to learning management to mobile apps for parents to tuition management analytics payments financial management and now on the high end scholarship management so we really cover a lot in that school and so its pretty significant from a coverage standpoint and an opportunity standpoint so theres a cross sell opportunity here that is significant for us across all of those solutions that i just named theres also a significant value proposition here because a typical case of a school that is not a blackbaud full customer has either  or  standalone point solutions that are unintegrated and so moving to our cloud solution with common reporting and common user experiences and common data is a big impact to the operations of the school so its really early days in our opportunity to address that marketplace as well ben mcfadden  pacific crest securities thanks and tony i just wanted to ask a question here on the maintenance decline in the quarter which showed i guess an accelerated decline and mike mentioned the fact that that shows some success on as far as getting people ramped to subscription but i wonder if you could provide just a little bit more color as far as helping us dissect this maintenance line between how much of this is just an accelerated success on nxt migrations versus maybe some of the other factors that could be impacting that line such as endoflife products or the blackbaud crm going to a ratable recognition model anthony w boor  blackbaud inc yeah absolutely ben the overall metric that id suggest you look at from a potential churn is that our retention rate has held relatively flat yearoveryear at  so were not seeing any kind of increase in churn in the overall business from the migration sunsetting plans of all the products those are largely cloudbased or subscription model products not a lot in there are going to be maintenance the bbcrm would not be of maintenance decline unless you were to lose one of those customers and that would be reflected within the churn so the vast majority of that deceleration in maintenance would be moved over to the cloudbased nextgen products operator and well go next to rishi jaluria with jmp securities rishi jaluria  jmp securities llc hey guys thank you for taking my questions one thing on academicworks that i kind of wanted to follow up on mike you talked about how it hits the opportunity in higher ed and i know your major educational opportunity so far has been in k do you see a longer term opportunity to expand your products specifically into higher ed maybe either by retooling your existing academic solutions or maybe creating new ones and then i have one followup after that michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc sure yeah we actually have a pretty good presence in higher ed and do extremely well in the market we dont have as much application coverage in higher ed as we do in k as i just described all the things that we do in k we dont have that amount of coverage but we are looking for more academicworks is one example yes theres a lot more to do in higher ed from an application standpoint and from a crossselling standpoint as well so we think academicworks is a great fit in all three of those markets higher ed foundations and k theyre all scholarship – the granting and receiving institutions that are really unautomated so our opportunity in higher ed i think is growing with our existing portfolio preacademicworks and now with academicworks just represents a bigger opportunity we also i think you know we stood up higher ed as a more formal vertical brought in an executive a little over six months ago with significant higher ed experience that heads up that vertical for us hes been here seven or eight months now and has brought a whole new dimension to that leadership and focus on the higher ed vertical for us rishi jaluria  jmp securities llc okay got it got it and tony on the services side i know you mentioned that part of the reason that you expect to see a decline now versus flat services dollars yearoveryear has been that theres less customization involved and more outofthebox solutions have you also been able to i guess see some offloading of services workloads to partners thats also contributed to that or can you help us kind of understand how partners have played a factor in this role here anthony w boor  blackbaud inc not yet we havent seen and we havent done much on the front from a partners perspective its something we continue to evaluate and look at for the future but today that had very little impact on the numbers you saw we do also have mix and promotional issues thatll affect services and then just seasonality so i think when you look at those across the board nothing highly unusual i think the biggest impact again is just our rapid move to the cloud is overall reducing the need for services i think is the point to take home michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc and ill just add something too we talked about a lot when we announced nxt but we havent really talked about this that much is weve got a pretty significant focus on our cloud solutions not just on the features that the customers see but on full automation as well so weve effectively automated for the most part the implementation of solutions like raisers edge nxt where if you go back and look at raisers edge it took a person to either show up on site or to have a pretty substantial project plan with a customer even to move from an older version of raisers edge to the raisers edge  but to move to nxt its largely an automated process where for example an existing raisers edge customer would get an email with links you click on the links and the transition begins so we in fact have some customers that go from raisers edge to nxt over a weekend it used to be a multimonth database transition process so weve largely automated that which is great to accelerate adoption in the market and reduce our operating cost and drive cloud sales but it also puts some pressure on the fact that there is a need for services revenue in those scenarios operator and well take our next question from rob oliver with robert w baird jason velkavrh  robert w baird  co inc broker good morning this is jason velkavrh on for rob thanks for taking our questions the first question so one of the benefits youve mentioned with having more sales reps in local markets is – i know you mentioned a situation last quarter where a customer was looking to move to a competitor and you kind of were able to preempt that im just curious with having reps in the field for kind of a longer period of time now is there any other competitive learnings you would call out and just even more broadly just anything else in the competitive environment that youd call out right now michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc yeah i mean the competitive environment hasnt changed all that much for us as far as who we compete with our win rates are very high and its really all about being in market and driving higher productivity with local sales executives and its been a pretty substantial change for us if you go back a couple of years when i started a little over three years ago we didnt have a physical office in new york silicon valley and toronto and we do now and it makes a big difference as far as the frequency of customer interaction and weve made a lot of changes in the company right were a new company and its best to deliver that message face to face and customers actually seeing the product and demos and what have you and lastly ill just add the market opportunity is significant this is a very large market with several hundred thousand addressable customers and so were investing in sales in a way that hasnt happened before historically before i came here most of our north american sales folks were here in south carolina and its a fieldbased model and it should be a fieldbased model so its productivity its size of addressable market and its just the opportunity to present itself to having folks in the field and we think about this in terms of also having the support infrastructure as well so we need more sales engineers in the field and weve been investing as you know in customer success as well so its a combination of customerfacing individuals based on the opportunity that we see in front of us jason velkavrh  robert w baird  co inc broker great thanks a lot and then one more from me you mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the developments with sky ai im just curious if you can elaborate a little more are these features that are baked in the current products and  are there any future skus that you could offer separately and then again more broadly just anything on how youd monetize the ai features in the sky platform michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc sure its all of those so yes theyre baked into existing solutions whats really interesting about what were doing and i think its quite unique is that its a combination of products not just tool kits but products that are built and in many cases specific to your vertical industry so predictive analytics products built for example on arts and culture institution that hides the data and the predictive analytics together from transactions or the things like ticket purchasing and donations and ability to drive revenue based on the data that our customers have and the data that we also add so were covering this in a pretty comprehensive way not just providing a tool kit it includes big data and thats data we purchase is proprietary data that we have added to specific analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities embedded in solutions specific to grow the markets i talked in my prepared remarks about a healthcare application also combined with expertise we have data scientists that are focused on these solutions as well in addition to engineers and so its a combination of embedded intelligence in core solutions that just make the core platform a stronger platform that actually have predictive next steps that do things like predictive social listening in connections to social media predictive next steps for gifts for driving operational operation improvement and its embedded solutions and new skus as well so its been a big focus for us for a while weve just repackaged this together now in a more digestible marketfacing sort of branded way but its not a new capability this is something that is a significant industry differentiator no one in the industry is doing this when you combine the analytics the ai and the data and the expertise and no one is doing this at a subvertical level arts and cultural higher ed healthcare et cetera so its quite unique and the other thing that happens here is it differentiates our core solutions in the subscription line when these are embedded and integrated in the way that were doing this were really excited about the expertise that we brought in over the years here and the opportunity to help our customers be a lot more successful and differentiate us in the marketplace in our core solutions operator and well go next to kirk materne with evercore isi kirk materne  evercore group llc yeah thanks very much guys i guess mike first one for me would just be on the incremental hiring around sales reps whats the right way to think about the ramps in productivity for those folks as we think out and the potential for you guys to see some reacceleration is it six to nine months to get someone up and productive i assume it depends on whether their going after some new logos or going after the base but could you just give us some – i guess some incremental comments on that just help us – just thinking about that michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc sure i say that on the average six to nine months is a good number but when you get into the specific job types its pretty wide right so were ramping up with entrylevel folks that are crossselling things like subscriptionbased learning in education into the existing base they ramped up very very quickly and then were also bringing in enterprise folks that are competing for multimillion dollar deals and it takes a while and then its the mix between hunters and back to base but if you put a macro on it id say six to nine months is a pretty good macro when you average it out across the different types and whats really interesting about what were doing is we see the need for all those types not just one type so we are ramping up phone were ramping up midmarket were ramping up into some particular verticals and on the enterprise side as well and its also requiring us obviously to bring in either promote from within or bring in some outside sort of first and second line sales leadership as well which has been really great as far as the level of interest that we have and folks coming to blackbaud kirk materne  evercore group llc great and then just one for tony tony obviously your comments on the maintenance sort of shifting over to the subscription bucket as you make this transition can you just talk about i guess qualitatively because i assume youre not going to want to discuss it specifically but qualitatively what that means from a margin perspective meaning are you getting a multiplier on that dollar of revenue over subscription that more than offsets for the difference in gross margins in general im just trying to get a sense on obviously thats the way you want things to go but does that have a near term sort of negative impact on operating margins as you go through that transition thanks anthony w boor  blackbaud inc sure thanks kirk maintenance margins for us have historically been very strong in  to  range so the shift to subscriptions today – we talked about last year investor day were seeing a  to  times uplift from what a average customer was paying an actual maintenance to what they would pay in the subscription for nxt raisers edge nxt or financial edge nxt was kind of average weve not updated that number but not a lot of change in the market so presumably thats still holding the downside on the margin on the subscription is that weve done a lot of work and made substantial investments from an rd perspective over the last few years and innovation and building out those new nextgen products youve seen the result of that in the financials with gaap requires us to capitalize those software costs qualify and as a result weve seen a large ramp in cap software over the last few years and that in turn is resulting in an acceleration in growth and amortization but cap software in amortization largely hits within the subscription cogs so it drags down the subscription margins mix is another big piece kirk that comes into play so overall i would suggest the costs of infrastructure support costs cap software all of those things taken to consideration subscription margins probably a bit less than what wed see in maintenance so a little bit of dilution there overall and then mix is the bigger piece really for us in your modeling going forward usage and recurring subscriptions are accretive to our overall company gross margins but payments inclusive of smarts related payments business would be dilutive to our gross margins so that will be the key factor really to watch as your modeling in the future years where that mix comes up michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc so just to add to that too right just to think about the top of the pl as weve mentioned before in the maintenance line predominantly made up of re and fe and customer retention rates are  so the shift to subscription has been started and underway and were also obviously – and if you look at the guidance for the year and last couple of years you can see that margin is moving up at the whole company level so we have some of these shifts from maintenance to subscription happening marginwise as well inside the business but operating margin at the company level based on our guidance is actually moving up and we think theres a long runway in that opportunity as well anthony w boor  blackbaud inc yeah and i think maintenance is what about  of the size of subscription now so much smaller base michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc yeah operator and well go next to brian peterson with raymond james brian peterson  raymond james  associates inc good morning gentlemen thanks for taking the question so clearly theres an increased focus on adding new logos just curious if you think about the potential customers in that  billion tam how much of that would you characterize as white space versus potentially displacing a competitive solution michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc well i dont know that theres any pure white space but sometimes the competitive solution at low end is excel or access right theres always something there so its a mix and i could tell you some product lines its just it is at the micro its white space so adding advanced analytics tools or moving a customer who is in a model from fundraising standpoint collecting checks and cash to automated integrated payments i guess thats white space so its a pretty wide mix and i mean youd be probably surprised that some of the legacy systems that were out there upgrading i know a customer that had a yearold system from a legacy hardware manufacturer that we recently replaced so its a pretty wide mix out there of what the industry is using and the move toward our new cloud solutions is a substantial upgrade for them as far as durability to drive revenue and reduced operating cost so the opportunity for financial improvement in the customer base is significant on our new platforms brian peterson  raymond james  associates inc got it and maybe one follow up for you tony im sorry if i missed this but any help on what youre expecting for sales head count growth in  and progress yeartodate on those efforts thanks guys anthony w boor  blackbaud inc yeah i dont think weve historically given any guidance on that id look back brian probably at just what weve done historically its obviously a key focus and kind of the last piece of our strategy to continue to invest in sales and obviously we speak a lot about improving productivity as well last year i think we added – it was a full organic year because we didnt have an acquisition – i think we added roughly  direct sales heads so thats kind of  increase which was a bit higher than where weve been historically because typically a good chunk of the adds have come through acquisition so it was a fairly strong year from just an overall organic increase in sales head count and then were also – as mike said weve made a lot of investments and focus on improving the productivity with the entire existing sales head count base so thats effectively adding sales head count in and of itself also operator and well go next question to kevin liu with b riley kevin liu  b riley  co llc hey good morning just in terms of the current conversion yields that youre seeing does that increase kind of the competitiveness as clients potentially evaluate other providers and then could you also talk about any sort of differences in your win rates and conversions versus just going after new account michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc sure so if youre specifically referring to raisers edge and financial edge conversions because thats the arguably the largest conversions that were working on just go back to thinking about retention rates historically so retention rates historically for those products prior to our new cloud solutions were in the lows at the whole company level were still at  so those are highly retained customers those solutions are very deep from a functionality standpoint and pretty widely installed there has not historically previous to the last couple of years been a lot of innovation at blackbaud so if you combine the fact that these were highly retained customers with a lack of innovation over the last decade with the fact that in the last twoandahalf three years theres significant innovation and significant uplift in customer success when they moved to the new platform it just bodes for really interesting model that these customers are highly retained when there wasnt a good answer in the future version and now that there is its just a big opportunity for us in the customer base so i would just point to all of those factors and sort of whats happening in the marketplace the other thing as i mentioned a couple of minutes ago because weve taken a lot of the pain out of conversion from lets say raisers edge to nxt through automating the back office when you go from raisers edge  to nxt for the bulk of the customer base thats a significant competitive advantage so as the customer is looking to go from raisers edge  to some competitive platform were signing up for a very long and arduous conversion process which doesnt exist moving to our cloud solutions which are frankly better than the competition in the marketplace so pretty good story for our customers that had been with us for a long time looking to modernize to a new cloud solution kevin liu  b riley  co llc got it and as youre starting to see more conversions and presumably having that maintenance stream continue to come down what sort of opportunity do you see there either this year or perhaps in the future to try to get those margins back up to where they were historically michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc well i think my first year when i started at the company level our margin was  right were guiding to  to  so you can think about the fact that yes we have some product transitions going on and at the face of the pl we have maintenance reducing by design and subscriptions with a healthy organic growth those are happening and those will continue to happen for a while at the top of the house though were improving margin of the whole company while thats going on right so the transition were talking about now is two products out of a very strong cloud product portfolio right so i think we have to remember specifically what were talking about these are product results that are resulting in a really nice uptick on the future subscription opportunity line from re and fe to raisers edge nxt and financial edge nxt but the top of the house for company results were improving margins of the whole company right so raisers edge and financial edge are a subset of the company we do not have a product line that dominates the revenue line of the business operator and well go next to mark schappel with benchmark mark w schappel  the benchmark co llc hi thank you for taking my question most of my questions have been answered i do have one though and tony this is for you building on an earlier question i was wondering if you could address the retention rates in the quarter i think earlier you touched on this if i recall correctly the  churn was around  to do the sunsetting of several products i was wondering if that retention rate is still holding around  and when we might start moving forward anthony w boor  blackbaud inc yeah its holding well at  weve historically if youre going to look back several years have been in kind of a  to  range so considering all of the portfolio rationalization that were going through currently i feel very positive that those rates have held we have talked a couple of years ago about some analysis we had done and we just recently updated that which is important to note thinking about just mikes last answer to kevins question our retention rate on raisers edge financial edge has typically been in the low to mid range over the years without the innovation and we have done some analysis that when a customer also utilized or owned one of our analytic services and utilize our payments platform then our retention rates actually were up in the very highs ie in the   range the interesting thing is with re nxt for instance that has embedded payments embedded analytics as well as online solutions and several other pieces all integrated into one suite so wed anticipate to see some very positive improvements in retention assuming we get good quality adoption of all of the nxt feature functionality capability over the years as well so that should prove to be a very positive on retention rate as we migrate that base of re and fe over to the nxt models mark w schappel  the benchmark co llc great thank you very much operator and well go next to ryan macdonald with wunderlich securities ryan macdonald  wunderlich securities inc hi good morning guys focusing on sort of the focus on adding new customer adoption and ramping the sales force of that can you talk about as youve gone through this process and sort of getting more sales head count in the field and sort of selling the solution to new customers can you talk about how youre seeing sort of the conversation evolve when you bring in to the fact that you are seeing more substantial competitors or more aggressive say pricing from your competitors in the marketplace and how that affects the sales process for your sales reps michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc yeah its actually been really positive for us because of our new solutions the ability to bring that k solutions to market as i described what we have there earlier or what were doing in higher ed in a lot of verticals and on new platforms weve embedded artificial intelligence and analytics and integrated mobile and online payments in a modern intuitive cloud experience has been a massive upgrade for blackbaud all those things didnt exist three years ago and so it makes it a heck of a lot easier to sign up new customers when that experience and that level of purposely built solutions for this industry are demonstrating come to bear one thing thats unique about us is the solutions we build are not generic for all industries its specific to our markets and our customers and in a modern cloud environment it really resonates with net new customers and so from a sales standpoint when i got here we were still selling a lot – youd be shocked at how many new raisers edge customers were selling every year on the old version pre re nxt because of the depth of functionality in that product to serve this marketplace right we put all that forward into a modern cloud solution so that really resonates well with net new customers ryan macdonald  wunderlich securities inc got it and then just a quick followup on the academicworks acquisition can you talk about if any customer overlap that you have with that solution within your existing base within the k market michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc yeah mostly in the higher ed market there was some customer overlap theres also a lot of cross sell opportunity in the higher ed market theres also some overlap to a lesser extent in the foundation marketplace and k market lots of cross sell opportunity there and theres also again the combination of cross selling that platform back into the higher ed foundation of k space and then just net new customers operator and it appears that there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back to mike gianoni for any additional or closing remarks michael p gianoni  blackbaud inc thanks operator ill just close everyone by saying q was a really solid start to the year for us were really pleased with our progress that weve made against our strategic plan and our four strategic objectives we plan to further these initiatives in  and achieve our financial guidance and longterm aspirational goals tony and i look forward to updating all of you in our progress on the next call and thanks everyone for your participation operator this
