call over to curtis curtis curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp thank you michelle and hello to everyone on the call today our second quarter built upon the positive results over the past few quarters marked by a solid organic growth which was up nearly  in q compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis earnings per diluted share were  per share which was up  yearoveryear and included just  of adjustments mostly related to incremental compliance costs and those expenses continue to wind down we are pleased to see consistency building in our business and view the second quarter results as a further indication that the esterline operating system and our lean efforts are taking hold to that point we were able to show a meaningful improvement in operating results despite the anticipated higher rd spend and a substantially higher tax rate during the period which was also expected before getting into a summary of the quarters results id like to take a few moment to highlight some important operational activities from the quarter as we discussed our business is normalizing after a challenging period over the past few years during which we completed a host of companywide integration efforts greatly enhanced our internal compliance procedures and strategically reshaped our business portfolio this last process took another step forward in the second quarter of  as we completed the sale of the bvr product line as you may recall a portion of this business that was a good fit with our aerospace profile was retained and integrated into our everett washington facility also this quarter we signed our certification to the us state department declaring that we have completed the requirements set forth in our trade compliance consent agreement this marks an important milestone towards exiting the agreement and moving forward with an effective export compliance program initial feedback from the government officials reviewing this report reaffirms our estimation that we can have this process completed within the fiscal year in addition to these important operating initiatives cash flow is obviously a critical metric in addition in the second quarter we took advantage of our international business structure and ability to generate cash to pay down debt which bob will cover in more detail as a result our leverage ratio on a gross debt basis is now under  times which puts us in good financial position to continue pursuing acquisition opportunities as part of our longterm growth strategy these would will include companies between approximately  million to  million in sales that fit within our technologies footprint and operating structure we look specifically to advance our strategic objectives through synergies that we can leverage with the solid work that weve been doing on our operating system importantly we also continue to refine our operational processes and drive our high performance organization investor line in  we began holding strategic sessions called leadership weeks at various operations throughout the company these leadership weeks bring together groups of executives and senior staff members to share best practices and tackle real business issues indentified in areas such as production efficiency waste elimination process velocity health and safety just to name a few i personally attended a session in france in the second quarter and its an expectation that all company leaders attend to that at least one of these meetings scheduled throughout this year in addition weve recently launched the second annual esterline senior leaders of tomorrow program this is an inhouse program to help develop talented early career employees and provide a yearlong project opportunity for them to spearhead an important esterline business initiative including such things as operations planning customer service improvements and marketing and business development now turning to the high level results for the quarter the second quarter sales were  million up  compared to the prior year level this marks a similar growth rate to the yearoveryear results we saw in the first quarter higher sales in the second quarter were driven by a positive contribution from our avionics  controls segment which saw a  yearoveryear increase in segment revenue primarily through the avionics systems platform sensors  systems was also higher in the quarter up  compared to the prior year this was driven by power systems as well as continued strength in aftermarket volume in our sensors business as anticipated advanced materials offset a portion of these gains as sales declined  yearoveryear which was entirely attributable to our very measured pace to bring back volume at our arkansas defense technologies facility with that said im pleased to report that as of march we are back at full production at this facility with equipment upgrades and process improvements in place that will help us remain safe and productive moving forward gross margin at a consolidated level improved  basis points to  with higher profitability primarily the result of improved volume and mix in our avionics  controls segment we saw strong performance in our avionics business led by advanced displays or defense applications a higher volume of aftermarket in our sensors  systems provided a lift to the sensors  systems segment profitability operating profit in our advanced materials segment was also up in the quarter an insurance recovery payment received in connection with the arkansas defense technologies event last may contributed to the segments absolute profitability as well as the return on sales gaap net income from continuing operations was significantly stronger yearoveryear at  million or  per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal  compared with  million or  per diluted share in the second quarter of  higher earnings stemmed from higher total sales and increased leverage on the higher volume improved mix and cost savings associated with our integration activities and our esterline operating system initiatives these positive contributions were partially offset by the higher rd spending and a significantly higher tax rate before i turn it over to bob id like to give an update on each of our endmarkets the outlook in our oem business remains positive driven by strength in some of our classic programs such as the  we also saw betterthanexpected volume from the  and  programs in the quarter on whole we continue to project lowsingledigit growth in our commercial oem business for the year in our aftermarket which accounts for about  of our total sales yearoveryear volumes increased in lowsingle digits and we saw strong sequential growth over the first quarter were seeing particular strength in europe and asia remains strong in our defense markets there is clearly an indication that the current us administration to increase defense outlays as was demonstrated by a  rise in military spending built into the budget proposal for the remainder of the fiscal year including specific callouts on important programs for esterline such as the f while its still a bit early to speculate on the longterm business impact of global defense spending we have several good opportunities to drive growth in this market which include international interest and improving order trends in our us countermeasures business in our adjacent markets demand for gaming and medical products is steady and in the industrial markets we expect nuclear activity to pick up later in the year particularly for our engineered materials products while our power and connection businesses see some positive outlook in the rail market halfway through the fiscal year  its shaping up well as we expected as were returning to a solid footing that we can build upon within our strategic focus areas our sales growth initiatives are beginning to take hold and the esterline operating system is driving meaningful productivity enhancements our teams are laserfocused on our core values and our strategic initiatives while were pleased with this progress we are also mindful of the remaining performance ramp projected through the second half of the year and yet we remain intently focused on execution now ill turn it over to bob and we can take a closer look at the numbers robert d george  esterline technologies corp thank you curtis good afternoon everyone the second quarter accomplished a number of positives for us weve maintained the momentum we generated over the previous four quarters we derisked some of the second half performance ramp we have been projecting continued to eliminate the need for nongaap reporting completed the sale of our bvr business and returned our gross debt leverage ratio to our historic standards from a high level financial perspective the second quarter read lines are the following organic sales growth of nearly  gross margin expansion in all three segments continued focus on and reduction of sga expense adjusted earnings per share growth of  and strong free cash flow lets turn to the details as curtis mentioned second quarter  sales were  million up  from the  million in the second quarter of  we benefited from strong business fundamentals in the quarter but also from shipping several orders in the second quarter that had originally been planned for delivery in the third quarter this has helped to level out our quarters a bit more and lower the execution risk in the second half of the year for us its worth noting that a challenging performance ramps still remains in the final two quarters of fiscal  and we expect some modest foreign exchange headwinds at the topline through the remainder of the year consolidated gross margin was  million or  of sales in the second quarter of  this compares with  million or  of sales in the same period of  sga expense in the quarter was  million  of sales compared with  million or  of sales in the second quarter of  the entirely esterline team is clearly focused on cost controls sga expenses were reduced in the second quarter even as sales volume increased and rd efforts expanded we are definitely seeing progress in our esterline operating system focused activities as well in addition the impact of integration and compliance cost on the quarter was normal we continue to ratchet down our spending and associated adjustments for these incremental costs in the second quarter of  gaap net income from continuing operations was  million or  per diluted share this compares with  million or  per diluted share in the prior year period on an adjusted basis excluding compliance and integration cost net income from continuing operations was  million or  per diluted share a solid improvement over the adjusted  per diluted share in the prior year period drilling further into the segment details avionics  controls sales were up  from  million last year to  million this year in the second quarter avionics systems was the primary contributor to this sales growth driven by advanced displays this segment is also one of the business lines where sales volume benefited from orders shifting into the second quarter from the third quarter adjusted operating income in the avionics  controls segment was  million or  of sales compared with  million or  of sales in the prior year period product mix is improving in the segment as is operations execution and the positive result in the quarter was a combination of increased sales volume mix and operational improvements in our sensors  systems segment sales were  million up  compared with the prior year sales were driven by both advanced sensors and power systems as increasing oem shipments benefited both platforms and additionally we saw a positive aftermarket sales volumes globally in the second quarter of  adjusted segment level operating profit in the second quarter for the sensors  systems segment was  million or  of sales this compares with  million or  of sales in the prior year in our advanced materials segment sales decreased by  yearoveryear to  million in the second quarter of  adjusted segment level operating profit was  million or  of sales compared with  million or  of sales in the prior year period the lower sales volumes are a reflection of the measured restart of operations in our defense technologies countermeasures facility the operating profit percentage is influenced by the related business interruption insurance payment at this facility we recognized a  million benefit in the second quarter from the final business interruption insurance payment at defense technologies from the incident in may of last year we also recorded business interruption insurance payments in the first quarter of  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal  for total insurance payments of  million from the incident that occurred in may  importantly as curtis mentioned our colleagues in this facility demonstrated that they are back up and running at full strength as we head into the second half of our year we are counting on their contributions and the outlook for this business looks positive the team worked hard to maintain good customer relations and communication through the startup process back to our consolidated results we reported operating profit of  million or  of sales compared with  million or  of sales in the prior year second quarter a consistent theme is the key drivers to this performance for improved sales better product mix with higher gross profit continued progress on sga expense control and a solid contribution from our aftermarket last year as you will recall our adjustments included some onetime items and contract adjustments if we adjust for compliance and integration expenses in both years and the last years onetime items second quarter operating profit was  million this year or  of sales compared with  million last year or  of sales our effective tax rate in the second quarter of  was  compared with a rate of  recorded in the prior year as we discussed in the first quarter the yearoveryear difference is due to international tax law changes and the second quarter  rate is right in line with our expectations keeping us on track to land at a full year tax rate of around  to  you may recall we had an exceptionally low tax rate in the first quarter of  due to a reduction in french deferred tax liabilities we expected higher rates in the ensuing quarters to reach our full year guidance and this has not changed in the second quarter of fiscal  cash flow from operations was  million compared with  million in the second quarter of fiscal  depreciation and amortization in the first six months of  was  million capital expenditures were  million free cash flow for the first half of  was  million compared with  million in  we are pleased to report that in the second quarter of  we paid down  million in debt in most part from cash generated within our international operations changes in uk tax laws allowed us to rebalance our capital structure to efficiently use invested capital toward this debt payment at the end of q our leverage ratio was  times on a gross debt basis versus approximately  times at the end of q  over the last several quarters our focus has been to restore our balance sheet to its historic strength and to improve strategic flexibility to deploy capital and drive additional value to shareholders we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter of fiscal  and  million remains available in repurchase authority on our  million total share repurchase program second quarter  bookings were  million this is a  decline from last years second quarter level of  million you might recall that last year in q we benefited from the lumpy defense ordering pattern within advanced materials and several multiyear defense contracts and component orders were booked during that period thus creating a tough compare our backlog was  billion at the end of the second fiscal quarter of  versus  billion in the prior year the lower backlog relative to the prior year is mostly attributable to the large long cycle orders received in the first half of  based upon recent quarterly bookings second quarter  order rates are in line with our historical quarterly run rate we continue to expect our fiscal  full year sales to be in the range of  billion to  billion the evaluation of our full year guidance at the top and bottom lines has not materially changed despite our solid results in the first and second quarters in fiscal  as i mentioned earlier the sales that came in q rather than q will simply help to more evenly balance the back half of the year making our performance ramp less steep than our original expectation nevertheless it is still a significant climb also i pointed out earlier that advanced displays is performing well but there are several large advanced displays orders scheduled very close to the end of the year were confident in our ability to deliver but customer scheduling on these projects can be an additional determining factor for delivery days and as you know it can be challenging to achieve continued increased performance over the generally slower summer months again we know our teams can perform we just see this as a level of inherent risk we kept all these factors in mind when we established our guidance initially and these factors are still in play and remain open issues the principal business case has not changed therefore were maintaining our fiscal  adjusted earnings per share guidance range at  to  free cash flow and ebitda expectations similarly remain strong consistent and unchanged and now back to curtis before taking your questions curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp thanks bob in closing we feel good about where we are right now its refreshing to get back to cleaner quarters with fewer adjustments as we reach the tail end of some heavy lifting weve been doing in the way of compliance operational excellence and portfolio optimization and now were beginning to see some dropthrough from our efforts in our financial performance we started to see it this quarter with better efficiencies and some meaningful declines in costs we are pleased with the performance and the progress made by our teams in the first half of the year and we remain confident in our fullyear plans we are very focused on executing to achieve those plans and with that well open it up to take some questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of howard rubel from jefferies sir your line is now open howard a rubel  jefferies llc thank you very much good afternoon and curtis nice numbers curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp thank you howard a rubel  jefferies llc and i do recognize your point about clean its refreshing curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yes howard a rubel  jefferies llc  from our perspective too just to talk about booktobill for a moment and you emphasized historically or bob emphasized historically that this is in line with sort of where youve been and you feel comfortable with it could you address a little bit the pipeline and what you might see in order to – how much is really open in terms of the challenge for the sales side curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah maybe ill start off on that we look at that now business unit by business unit on what we have to book and ship for the quarter compared to i think  or  months ago a lot better visibility there so we did have a couple of large orders where we get maybe one or two orders ill mention  as an example last year they would have booked – kind of placed a larger annual order in q thats going to happen now in q so we were just talking about that weve got some other defenserelated orders that are the same way in our displays business so there is some chunky things that we can go out and touch and i think its a matter of a little bit of a tough compare with last year and some of those things pushing out literally just three or four weeks that they didnt hit in this quarter so were not concerned with that and we have a pretty good handle on it howard a rubel  jefferies llc and then one other item in terms of business conditions it appears as if the connectors business has shown some reflection of or call it improved european economy could you sort of – because that just touches so many different markets could you address what you see and how your customers feel and whether in fact thats ahead of your plan curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah ill talk about it its interesting i was over in champagne for this leadership week and got to spend some real quality time with those folks very optimistic that plant is running at highest levels theyve seen and so its really nice to be able to open up some capacity which were optimistic about but good – some bright spots in the defense markets for not just us but internationally both in france and some other locations a little bit on high speed rail were seeing some connector pullthrough there and in our power business both in the us and in asia a little bit – havent seen as much on oil and gas yet so thats maybe not quite as much there as we mentioned in nuclear market we are seeing a lot of coding  activity both on the decommissioning in the uk and the newbuild so there is some nice pieces there i will just touch on the connector business it has done a really nice job that team – very impressed with them theyre really starting to add some volume there and when they do that it drops through very nicely howard a rubel  jefferies llc thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of robert spingarn from credit suisse sir your line is now open curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp rob you there unknown speaker hi good afternoon this is joe  on for rob robert d george  esterline technologies corp hi joe  curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp hi joe  unknown speaker hi nice quarter just wanted to ask curtis your comments on the balance sheet and capital deployment it sounds like your numberone priority for the cash is ma can you just comment a little bit on what the pipeline looks like is it fairly active and i know its always hard to predict timings and deal closes but are you hoping to do some deals this year curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp were just starting to look – we were very focused on getting our balance sheet back in line and were very focused on that i think were starting – weve been starting to look at more deals there is a couple that weve been involved in that weve looked at and havent worked or we thought got a little too pricy so it is pretty active out there right now were going to be very disciplined in how we look at them we just finished up each of our business units coming forward and presenting opportunities that they saw and were looking at some at the corporate level were going to be disciplined about it but again as we got our balance sheet back in line it does open up a – taking a look at those again so it is a priority i dont know bob do you want to – bobs pretty involved in that do you want to make a comment bob robert d george  esterline technologies corp hey joe  i just would echo curtis comments we have been involved in a couple of processes that weve not taken to the end i would say the commercial aerospace area is relatively quiet and thats been confirmed in some of my meetings across the space defense is robust reflecting the high valuations the market itself right now on both sides commercial and military is rich based on current valuation levels as curtis said we will be disciplined in our approach we got to maintain the focus on strategic acquisitions and the ability to realize benefits from the acquisition using the esterline operating system robert m spingarn  credit suisse hey guys its rob i apologize phone glitch but joe  stepped in there on the aftermarket curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp hey rob robert m spingarn  credit suisse good to see you nice quarter can you talk a little bit about the aftermarket the uptick that you referenced earlier and to what extent it reflects this strong traffic we saw in the beginning of the year and how sustainable it is curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah i definitely think its traffic driven as you know in our engine business sensors business that does correlate pretty strongly to traffic growth so i think thats the majority of it we did some operational things in our switch business to try to drive some better availability and decrease the flow time and better serve the market thats still a project that were working on there but feel pretty good about what were seeing and i think it is sustainable robert m spingarn  credit suisse and bob you may have said this earlier in your monolog but whats the aftermarket growth embedded in the guide robert d george  esterline technologies corp we are maintaining midsingle digits in that area rob robert m spingarn  credit suisse okay and would you say this quarter look like that or was it little better robert d george  esterline technologies corp quarter was a skosh better largely driven by sensors robert m spingarn  credit suisse okay all right thats it for me thanks guys curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp great thanks rob robert d george  esterline technologies corp thanks rob operator our next question comes from the line of michael ciarmoli from suntrust sir your line is now open michael ciarmoli  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey good evening guys nice quarter and thanks for taking my questions curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp hey mike michael ciarmoli  suntrust robinson humphrey inc bob just on the margins for advanced materials the  obviously get – im assuming theyve got a little bit of the tailwind in there from that insurance settlement but even removing that still very good at  and i think you just said you came back up to capacity in march so how should we think about the margins in advanced materials are those sustainable robert d george  esterline technologies corp well mike great question as you know we have some incredibly strong businesses in advanced materials our wire management activities composite clamping our defense activities that we have are tremendous and we did have a very very solid product mix in that segment in the quarter as you pointed out and as curtis and i both identified in our scripted comments return on sales levels are impacted by the business interruption payment of  million because we didnt have the offsetting sales in the countermeasures facility we believe that that business will moderate somewhat on those margins we certainly are not looking at the  level but were also challenged – we just want to use a little caution were also challenged with our northeastern england operations they are impacted by the weak pound and based on the news ive been reading in the financial times and like and the hardball that the eu plans on playing with england that was the fx foreign exchange headwinds that were kind of building into our plans so id say that as we look into the second half our guidance is not predicated on that  rate but certainly high teens to the  michael ciarmoli  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it thats helpful and then just on you guys talked about the rd being up but on sga it comes down sequentially and i think at one point you guys were driving towards that target of  to  it sounds like youre making good operational progress what should we be thinking about sga on further goforward basis here curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp well we need to get some growth to leverage that we are watching it i think what youre seeing is some benefit of the integration projects going away which had some costs some of the moves the nmc move that we did has had some benefit in that segment but also some sga overall youre also seeing some wind down of the compliance efforts so we do have a pretty tight control on it i think we need to get some organic growth to go leverage that although we do – were watching it pretty closely we dont have any major restructures built in right now but there is a pretty detailed review at each business unit and there is an expectation that as we add sales we really limit any sga growth michael ciarmoli  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it okay thats helpful thanks a lot guys ill jump back in the queue here curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp okay thanks robert d george  esterline technologies corp thanks mike operator our next question comes from the line of sam pearlstein from wells fargo sir your line is now open samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc good evening curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp hi sam robert d george  esterline technologies corp hi sam samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc hi can you guys talk a little bit more about the order activity the  million in orders while i understand that the yearoveryear comparison it is still below your bookings so youre getting a little bit of a decline in the backlogs so just what are you seeing in terms of order activity and then more specifically how about some of the international defense opportunities like the avionics that youve been going after in the past curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah yeah again some of those things are lumpy weve got some stimulation orders again thats in our displays business that comes under avionics we do have some new cockpit opportunities that were looking at and there is a pretty long list of them that can move the needle were expecting knock on wood to get some of these weve had a few of the nuclear orders come through but those are pretty sizable from our uk business and were expecting some of that activity to happen later in the year there are some orders supporting i think some turkish business that i think the connection folks are out chasing so there is a couple – there is some nice activity internationally and some larger orders that we feel pretty comfortable about but it is a little bit lumpier than normal samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc and if i just look at the consent agreement now that youre done and youve submitted are there additional costs or is it a matter of waiting at this point for approval and do you still expect it around midyear curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah we do we submitted the report of – a number of our folks are actually back at state department later this week to go have a face to face so theyve read the report it was binders and binders worth of data so a very thorough report i think good feedback so far the onetime expenses of – we still have a structural compliance officer and we still have some investigation but most – the audit costs are down were done with the second big audit we have as you would imagine built up some internal compliance costs so its really finishing out any open items being responsive to what they tell us this week or anything else they see but its a pretty comprehensive program so i dont think – knock on wood weve got to work with them im sure hoping we get it done kind of midcalendar year samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc okay and one last question bob it sounds like you were able to use overseas cash to pay down the debt how much of your cash is now overseas versus in the us robert d george  esterline technologies corp so right now were sitting on approximately about  million to  million offshore we thought we were going to take that down lower but great things happened we generated a significant amount of cash in our canadian operations which offset some of the ability to bring that cash back samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc thank you robert d george  esterline technologies corp thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of howard rubel from jefferies sir your line is now open howard a rubel  jefferies llc thank you curtis youve kind of had this high level of rd or id say its a very standard level of rd and yet as we look we dont see a lot of new commercial aero projects so where is the focus and how soon – and how are you sort of thinking about it in terms of allocating the funds to your business units curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp right well it does vary quite a bit by business unit there is a long list in our avionics group of things they would like to go spend on and those get a little bit projectspecific retrofits and new product refreshes so there is a lot of discussion and debate about what we go do and spend there and i dont mind spending it i just want to make sure its effective and that were spending on the right projects like i mentioned on this leadership development program we also launched a more effective program management spend to make sure that were getting better at spending those dollars so avionics is one the other probably big area would be in our – the controls business where were still finishing up on e and theyve won some content on the x so there will be some continued spend there on the cockpit controls there is a number of things that they are out chasing so its a mix there is less in the advanced materials side but were actually challenging them to say if we did allocate more to you what new business could you go spend on there are some connectors that the guys want to go spend some time to develop new product families or fill in gaps on product families that im pretty supportive of so theres a smattering but i would think big macro picture youre right there are less things out there but were not just going to have it remain constant and let them go spend it on anything it needs to be revenue and profit generating but i think well do a good job of spending that money wisely howard a rubel  jefferies llc and then finally youve gone through a lot of pain to restructure the organization and we can see a little bit of improvement in this period are you going to move the targets a little bit just to make sure people arent too comfortable with where they are and can you share sort of what youre thinking on that curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah definitely i think weve shared this with people about the process that we go through but weve got some existing and some really good new fresh faces and the expectation is that this continuous improvement its move the bar all the time so the event that i was involved in was literally our champagne facility is probably one of the better operations leanest operations that we have and every time you go look at the factory its – the process i was involved with was how do we cut the days to manufacture in half and how do you go build that into the erp system and then get that on the website to go out and capture more business so there is not a – youre okay its a cultural thing to say we have this process how do you keep improving so it just takes a long time and it is a kind of a cultural shift but i feel better now than i ever have on weve got good leaders in place they get that and theyre driving their business to continue to improve so its not easy to go put a stake in the ground publicly and say it but ill tell you internally its how do we raise the bar and if youre all green its like you raised the bar now theyre red again and we continue to do that howard a rubel  jefferies llc and so if we think about just gross margins just to conclude on this and im sorry is you made – i mean this is for a middle period this is pretty darn good gross margin i know its a function of mix as we go forward but is there anything that you could share with us in term of how youd like to see the year play out in terms of gross margins and actually little bit longer term curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah i think the gross margins are pretty good i would encourage our folks if we need to to go out and capture more sales for leverage because we get some more leverage on our sga and we have some big oems that want to share some of that and we do have price downs that weve agreed to so im not going to get real aggressive on saying that the gross margins are going to go way up and if they do well go figure out what to do with that either have it come to the bottom line or go try to capture more market share howard a rubel  jefferies llc thank you thats great curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp great operator our next question comes from the line of david strauss from ubs sir your line is now open david e strauss  ubs securities llc thanks good afternoon robert d george  esterline technologies corp good afternoon david curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp hey david david e strauss  ubs securities llc hey curtis could you give us an update where you are on the draw down on the t how much of that has kind of worked through your numbers here curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah a big of chunk of it has worked through the numbers so that has had some pressure on our avionics business this year compared to last year it has been a little bit better with a few international sales than we had originally planned but not meaningful but its down probably  from where it was or more from where it was at a run rate level and that winds down to a – it goes out probably another year but its more international orders its pretty low level david e strauss  ubs securities llc okay and then on the transition from the cfm to leap how are you feeling about kind of holding the line there i think your shipset content is a little bit lower curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp yeah it is we dont have the engine sensors on that that team new team there that is very focused on trying to go see what they can do around the edges there to maybe try get some of that back or backfill that but thats a little bit of a challenge for us we also have some work on the structure side to fill in because the configurations a little bit different so thats a challenge for us but were out working it and trying to backfill that with new content either on gtf or other engine opportunities david e strauss  ubs securities llc okay and last one for me cash flow working capital if i look at your free cash flow guidance for the year it doesnt look – it looks like working capitals assumed about a neutral can you just talk about that and maybe if there could be some upside and how you view the opportunity from the working capital perspective longer term robert d george  esterline technologies corp yeah david youre correct i mean we are beginning to really have a crystal focus on inventory levels across the organization the esterline operating system and our lean efforts are now the way that we do business and are embedded we have been doing a pretty good job might even say really good job on the accounts receivable side managing to maintain our days sales outstanding in the face of some pretty harsh requests the inventory levels however are where we really see opportunity and i would expect as we go forward as you would imagine its not something that you can kind of turnaround in a short period of time but as we go forward thats where well see the opportunities in working capital on the cash flow side curtis any comment curtis c reusser  esterline technologies corp i think thats probably the area that we now – as we go focus on things and people are learning these tools thats probably that one area that we have the most discussion on so we reviewed four businesses today and we spent a very large amount of time talking about what youre doing about it when youre doing about – when its going to happen we had – as we moved some of these integration projects around that did cause a little bit of buffer that we had to build and it gets integrated with their ordering practices and trying to drive the velocity through the factories some plants not at – were not seeing it to the extent id like some plants have done a nice job and really moved the needle in the last  months others its been flat or gone the wrong way for a number of reasons so were really going to start focusing on that in a lot more detail probably over the next  to  months david e strauss  ubs securities llc all right thanks

equipment aerospace and defense report the president and ceo of esterline technologies corporation esl discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industrytwst how the business breaks down today would you expect that to continue in the future or is there any one area you are putting more focus on or that seems more promisingmr reusser if you look back at our recent history we have traditionally had more of an equal split between defense and commercial aerospace there have been two phenomena going on there we made investments in new platforms or programs such as boeings  aircraft as you know that program and others were a little bit slow to take off but now were really starting to see momentum build on the revenue side and that is tending to increase the size of our commercial businesson the defense side pressure on the us and international defense budgets has caused contraction in that market those factors have tended to keep our organic sales fairly flat but we see the defense side bottoming out and with the advent of the jsf increasing activity for the am and the p  which we have very good placement on  starting to pick up steam we should start to see some positive signs in that market i think the commercial and defense mix will stay skewed a little bit more toward commercial for the time being but defense is still a core piece of our business and should show promise going forwardthe other thing of interest in our business is this  of revenue that exists in adjacent markets there are three or four areas here where we see opportunity for doubledigit growth the interface controls for the medical business is growing at a very nice pace and thats a good market for us another is gaming we make humanmachine interfacing button panels and controls for slot machines and other regulated gaming devices that market is growing pretty fast especially in asia and we are wellpositioned to capture business in that niche with our technology and product brands a third strong adjacent market is nuclear primarily in europe we do both connectors as well as containment and insulation systems for new builds and upgrades of existing nuclear reactors specifically in the uk and elsewhere in europeso between those adjacent markets we expect they will grow relatively rapidly which could make them a larger piece of our overall business if they perform as we expect they will its a nice business fit for us because they are typically servicing highly regulated markets like aerospace and defense they are typically dealing with harsh environments they are generally highly engineered specialized products and they utilize the same supply chain so its an effective way to be able to capture some additional growth without having to get too far from our core technologiestwst what do you consider to be highlights of the companys performance since you started with esterlinefor more of this interview and many others visit the wall
