will now turn the call over to visionchina medias chairman and ceo mr li limin li interpreted thank you all for joining us today the first quarter of  further demonstrated our strategy for growth continued to gain traction we have seen evidence of economic rebound in the advertising industry starting in march and we expect that we will see an even stronger recovery in the second half of  the recent economic environment while challenging has presented opportunities as advertisers have been forced to deploy their advertising budgets more carefully and at times reallocate budgets to different media forms in the search for more costeffective ways to spend as advertising budgets return to more normalized levels we expect to retain our customers and see a sustainable increase in their spending were confident in our guidance for  the first quarter was challenging with seasonality compounded by a weak microenvironment and other industry challenges including pricing pressure in the cities in which we compete with other operators of mobile digital television advertising network despite these challenges we were able to recognize impressive year over year growth with total revenues increasing  to  million during  we took advantage of our strong balance sheet to selectively acquire six advertising agencies even before the acquisition visionchina had strong relationships with these agencies as they were our distributors which gave us solid working knowledge of their talented workforce and excellent customer relationships immediately after acquisition of these agencies i became personally involved in the management of the sales force that came to us through the acquisition and i have been very pleased with their results adding these companies to our corporation will have focused our efforts in ensuring that the acquired businesses are highly integrated with all aspects of our operations i will manage the entire team in the same way we manage our other sales team contracts human resources corporate culture training pricing income control commission and financial control policy are all set by our headquarters and revenues at both headquarters by our experienced corporate finance team additionally alfred and i are in constant contact with the management team of friends introduced to us by the acquired team we are introducing crm software to manage these customers and maintain proprietary customer information we believe that over time whether introduced through the acquired team or own sales team quickly come to appreciate the effectiveness of our platform and consider themselves to be direct clients of visionchina the acquisition has already made substantial contribution to our success and the rest of visionchinas operations have as a result been positively impacted were confident that the synergies remain very nice in connection with these acquisition will provide longterm benefit to the company and our shareholders during the first quarter we expanded into two new cities hangzhou and tianjin and added three additional lines to our beijing subway presence expanding our coverage to five of beijing eight subway lines with live cast and advertising capability on january   we gained the rights to advertise on a second mobile television channel in beijing subway that increases our network capacity in the capital city our network covers  of chinas most prosperous cities carrying a total of  million viewers experience per day looking ahead to the second quarter and the rest of the year we will continue to expand our current network and also selectively enter new markets within the public transportation space we have identified  cities that meets very specific criteria for entry and we will continue to execute through our partners and contracts the chinese government stimulus plan which is largely focused on infrastructure development will likely benefit our company as well and are planning to expand as the transportation systems of our key cities continues to grow meanwhile were also researching other delivery platforms that we might feel allow us to further grow operations in the future our longterm goal is to increase our market share going forward one of the ways to achieve this goal is through mergers and acquisition deals at the right valuation that will create value for our shareholders we believe our industry is poised for consolidation and expect to play an active role in this trend just one of the many benefits of industry consolidation will be that operating in a less fragmented industry will alleviate some of the pricing pressure already having a negative impact on our operating results recently we told you about the departure of our cfo dina liu who after two years at the company made the difficult decision to step down to spend more time with her family we were all sad to see her go but appreciate her years of financial oversight and contribution to the companys assets our search committee has initiated the hunt for here replacement and is working to ensure that the right highly qualified person takes the job visionchinas management works as a team we continue to have a strong management team in place the financial department for example remain well stocked chris holbert our vp of finance since last year is a new york licensed cpa with experience in us listed companies a big four background and expertise in financial management and sarbanes oxley compliance several other financial directors are also from the big four accounting firms and bring strong oversight to the company in the first quarter we also added helen plummer to our team at the investor relations offices helen has led our companys investor relations effort as an external consultant for the last two years and her addition to the team helps us to maintain our proactive approach to investor relations and ongoing transparency for the benefit of all shareholders i would like to conclude by saying that long term growth prospect for our business in the digital mobile tv industry as a whole in china remains very strong and we are optimistic of our strong fundamentals leading market position and the exciting future of the digital mobile television industry i will now turn the call over to alfred tong our chief marketing officer who will discuss our marketing and sales efforts in the field alfred tong thank you mr li hello everyone i would first like to go over some key operating metrics in the first quarter of the year  network capacity which is measured by total broadcasting hours was  hours up from  hours in the fourth quarter of  and  hours in the first quarter of  this increase was due to the addition of hangzhou and tianjin as well as the addition of three new lines of beijing subway to our network plus the launch of advertising operations on a second television channel in beijing that is broadcast to subway and separately broadcast to bus our asp as measured by average advertising service revenue was  per broadcasting hour in the first quarter of  down from  in the fourth quarter of  and up from  in the first quarter of  our asp were down due to seasonality and overall economic environment combined with the pricing pressure from competitors given the rate increase in january  in five key markets this gives us approximately  of that of traditional tv according to the research by cpr ph give us plenty of room to increase rate cut and grow revenues in the region in terms of our relationships with customers were seeing that companies that once go to visionchina platform as a new or experimental advertising avenue now consider us to be a fixed part of their advertising spend on that space we sold  advertising minutes per broadcasting hour in the first quarter of  compared to  minutes in the first quarter of  because of the increase in network capacity in the first quarter of  the company sold a total of  advertising minutes in is network compared to  minutes in the first quarter of  and  minutes in the fourth quarter of  over the quarter our customer make up inaudible of about two part domestic and one part international brands a quite healthy mix of advertiser across a variety of industries our retention and renewable rate remain very strong as well and the amount of new clients that has once tested on our network nearly all of them have continued to purchase advertising time on our network we ended the first quarter with  advertising c customers up from  at the end of the fourth quarter of  and  customers just one year ago in the first quarter  customers placed advertisement on our network in terms of sales personnel customers we have  salespeople as of march   as compared to  at the end of december last year and  as of march   it is our goal to extend our sales force to approximately  people by the end of  we expanded the contractors with several key customers and added many new customers to our strong client base during the first quarter including unilever philips toyota and inaudible which is a well known domestic fashion brand our concentration on clients among fmcg companies continue to provide deterrence from overall economic downturn at fmcg companies these make up two third of our customer base rely on ongoing advertising and promotions to quickly move good off store shelves were finding them more and more open turn up within portion of their available marketing budget which used to be used for promotion and event introduction in china as we provide a more cost effective and well targeted use of advertising dollars finally before turning the call over to chris i want to mention that completion of the third phase of ctr market research study inaudible of china digital mobile television industry these findings has provided longterm measurable feedback regarding commuter demographic allowing us and our advertisers to better tailor programming and advertisement to meet the needs of commuters this statistics continue to demonstrate that visionchina digital mobile television platform has nation wide audience and generate high retention rate at a fraction of the cost of traditional television finally inaudible the effectiveness of mobile television advertising and to inaudible in the past now have a much better understanding of how our media platform can complement the overall advertising strategy i will now turn the call over to our vp of finance mr christopher holbert christopher holbert thank you alfred visionchina medias total revenue were  million in the first quarter of  an increase of  compared to  million in the first quarter of  and a decrease of  compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  our gross margin decreased sequentially due to a combination of a decrease in revenue as a result of expected seasonality and overall weak economic environment and the nature of our fixed cost structure selling and marketing expenses represented  of the companys advertising service revenues in the first quarter of  compared to  in the first quarter of  and  in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to branding and sales building activities to expand the company sales network and strengthen its sales capabilities net margin was  in the first quarter of  compared to  in q  and  in the fourth quarter of  again as a result of a combination of decreased revenues and the nature of our fixed cost structure our basic and diluted net income per share for the first quarter of  was  and  respectively compared to  and  respectively in the first quarter of  and  and  respectively in the fourth quarter of  our first quarter net income excluding sharebased compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets nongaap was  million our net operating cash flow totaled  million in the first quarter of  and the average day sales outstanding in the first quarter was  days as we have mentioned in the past in the third quarter of  we increased our maximum credit days for major national and international brands as well as for agency contracts to be in line with industry practice our days sales outstanding as adjusted to reflect an increased number of customers who fall into those categories or goal remains to keep days sales outstanding in the  days range it is important to keep in mind that our sales forces are not paid commissions until accounts receivables are collected we are very comfortable with the brands on our accounts receivable list as the list is comprised of some of the largest multinational and domestic chinese brands who maintain strong credit history we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  million a decrease of  million from the end of  the decrease was mainly a result of earn out payments in connection with our  acquisition of six advertising agency businesses that were previously our distributors we believe that absent any unexpected drastic change in business conditions our cash on hand and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements in the foreseeable future regarding our share repurchase program during the first quarter we purchased  shares in the open market at an average price of  in total consideration of around  million turning now to  and our guidance we estimate total revenue which consists of advertising service revenues only in the second quarter of  to range from  million to  million second quarter  net income excluding sharebased compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets nongaap is expected to be between  million and  million we maintain our fullyear  estimate and expect total revenues will range from  million to  million net income in the full year  excluding sharebased compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets non gaap is expected to be between  million and  million we based these estimates on a foreign exchange rate of renminbi  per one dollar i would like to note that our guidance is based on our current network of  cities that as of today have already been secured by contracts if and when more cities are added our forecast will be impacted helen plummer we will now open up the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of wallace cheung with credit suisse go ahead wallace cheung – credit suisse hi good morning mr li alfred and chris helen hi just wanted to ask two questions quickly number one is can you explain a bit the reason why the advertisers number seems like down quite a bit in the first quarter and also can you update us about the backlog order as a percentage of your fullyear revenue guidance thank you hello alfred tong wallace this is alfred to answer your question basically the number of advertiser inaudible we ended with  advertisers but for the first quarter we basically have a healthy numbers of advertisers and in terms of the inaudible – wait a minute – yes well the inaudible is about  million renminbi and it is about  of year  advertisers have already renewed their contracts wallace cheung – credit suisse but is it sort of a – regarding my first question is it sort of a trend going forward that we begin to see therell be less customers but the value for each customer is actually will be much higher than before and also like it or not will that be leading to may be lower administration expense or marketing expenses as well thank you alfred tong actually for q most of them now seems to be spending the money more carefully so we believe that the number of advertisers will pick up in the second quarter just we know numbers inaudible advertising trend so because of the worldwide economic recession the number of advertisers is a little bit less but we believe that it is going to pick up in the second half helen plummer next question please operator our next question comes from the line of eddie leung with merrill lynch go ahead eddie leung – merrill lynch good morning everyone i guess you know to start with i want to follow up with wallaces second question on the percentage of presells the percentage of presell orders of your fullyear guidance how much have you presold of your fullyear guidance alfred tong inaudible about  renminbi that is about half of our guidance high end guidance number eddie leung – merrill lynch got it and the same question regarding your sales and marketing expenses how much of your sales and marketing expenses is variable coast and how much is fixed cost in terms of percentage alfred tong inaudible and for your question typically most of the percentage is for development cost eddie leung – merrill lynch and my final question is regarding your acquisitions could you share with us the percentage of revenues from the agencies that you acquired in last year for example can you tell about the first quarter revenues how much of that is coming from the agencies that you acquired last year dina liu hi eddie this is dina i would like to answer your question eddie leung – merrill lynch hi dina dina liu hi how are you in respect of revenue contributions from the agencies that were acquired last year they account for roughly  of last years revenue and then for the – out of the contract backlog we have for  that stood at about  million renminbi and roughly  of it comes from the inaudible eddie leung – merrill lynch got it thank you very much dina liu yes helen plummer next question please operator our next question comes from the line of philip wan with morgan stanley go ahead philip wan – morgan stanley good morning thank you for taking my questions i have a few quick questions number one is you mentioned about media cost guidance for  is about  million and is there any change to this media cost guidance and my number two question is we have been four months into this year and im wondering what is your pricing strategy and are we expecting a price hike for the second half of  i know that the company raised prices for five cities in the first half of  so are we expecting a price hike for all cities or just focusing on the key cities going forward thank you alfred tong this is alfred i would like to answer the second question first revenue pricing normally we build a rate structure every six months and we have a tentatively good the rate by end of may to see whether there is just a rate cut but i would say because of current economic situation so this year probably our focus will extend to increase the penetration rate first this is our key focus and then we will reveal the rate based on market demand and also our competitive pricing and also our advertisement spending of each of our advertisers and then we will finalize our rate cut whether it is our intention or not philip wan – morgan stanley okay limin li interpreted in terms of media costs there are two compositions one is based on the past contract or the existing cities we have already entered so the media cost is already determined in the contract and in addition to that in any additional media cost we incur by entering into new contracts helen plummer next question please operator our next question comes from the line of james marsh with piper jaffray go ahead james marsh – piper jaffray hi two quick questions first i was hoping you could discuss the ad minutes per broadcasting hour sold i assume they declined pretty substantially sequentially as well as yearoveryear and i wanted to understand is that driven predominantly by seasonality or is it do you think driven by competitive actions or maybe you dont want to sell as many units because the rates are not attractive so if you could talk a little bit about that and then just what type of i guess ad minute per broadcasting hour should we think about going forward should we look at previous seasonal quarters and assume it is the same or should it be lower just a little bit of help there would be appreciated alfred tong regarding the advertising – sales percentage and advertising minute hour yes this quarter a little bit increase is because of the product seasonality and also under current economic situation so when we talk – or more sort of trend looking on the trend and still allow uncertainty but it seems most of the times they will move their advertising budget from inaudible april may in the second half of the year so we believe that advertising minutes are principally for the same part of the year will maintain even for – as if may be the same as last year james marsh – piper jaffray okay right thank you and then i just had one follow up we discussed earlier that there is some evidence of an ad market recovery in march and i thought that was very good news but i was wondering what kind of evidence have you seen is it just anecdotal youre just talking to clients and theyre actually putting money to work if you can just help me understand what you meant by that alfred tong yes starting from – we see that – starting from march fiscal basically most advertising start to pick up the advertising spending because after the cmi ph they know more about their sales team in the first quarter so that is why the sales pick up and then they slowly increase their advertising sending so we will see something from the second quarter basically move their client starts up to the normal level of advertising spend in the last year james marsh – piper jaffray okay that is helpful thank you very much helen plummer next question please operator our next question comes from the line of james lee with sterne agee go ahead james lee – sterne agee hi just trying to understand your acquisition earn out payments a little bit better how much payment is there left for the remainder of the year besides what youre paying in the first quarter and can you help us understand maybe what is your benchmark for earn out   is that based on revenue or based on earnings and the  million maximum payment is that payment for the next two years going to be about  or is it kind of breakout for in terms of expectation of the outflow and is that  million the original amount of the agreement or that is based on an amount that is maybe renegotiated subsequently and any clarity on that would be very helpful thank you dina liu hi james this is dina i would like to take up your questions okay to answer the first part of the question which relates to our obligation for the payment compared to the earn out payment in fact we have made the payment of  million in q and the maximum earn out payment in respect of  performance was  so after we have received considerable investment and also meet certain criteria and then we will have additional  million to pay before we fully kind of control agent earn out payment and then the timing of that will depend on when we are able to own the ar assessment and also what particular terms of the payment will meet the criteria or not and then to answer the second part of the question regarding the maximum pay out for  and  based on the agreement the maximum earn out payment for performance is about  million because we have already paid deposits to those agencies that we acquired so the actual cash out – the total of the cash the next two years at  million after deduction to those two partners so based on our cash flow forecast for the next year we expect that our free cash flow will be more than the earn out payment for the acquisition the next two years and to answer your third part of the question on the allocation of the earn out payments in  and  right now it is pretty hard to determine right now with recent changes on incentives the acquired teams performance in  and right now we are still inaudible james lee – sterne agee now if i can follow up on dina the benchmark of earn out payments is that based on revenues or is that based on earnings or if we can get a sense get a flavor of what happened in terms of  earn outs assuming that that the backlog you just talked about right  of revenue comes from agency assuming  of revenue coming from agency this year can you give us a sense of how much would the earn out payment be for the performance – in the performance for  and  dina liu james there are certain – first to come up with the mechanism for the earn out payment is based on multiples so while we have inaudible the deal structure the payout is based on the separate pl by the team and is on the revenues and deducting the media cost an also operating cost itself and also the earn out payment is also based on even the timing of ar assessment if ar is not scheduled before  days they would lose the claim for those earn out payments what we have done in fact we have recently we have been able to take advantage of significant increase in our franchise value and also in the drop in valuation in market so we were able to renegotiate with the sellers of the teams to reduce the multiple network teams on those acquisitions and also reduce the tax on those earn out payments itself so that we are – those deals are accretive to our shareholders value and then in terms of their performance expected performance for   inaudible embedded in the transformation to protect ourselves and it really depends on the actual results at the end of this year so we can have a clear idea about the earn out payments and right now from what we can see is that the integration of the sales team has been very successful and also the franchise value of our platform has been strengthened significantly over the past years and now we can do that a lot in branded advertisers now they are coming to us more in terms of the effectiveness of our media rather than the relationships of the salespeople so we complement that those advertisers will stay with us are long term advertisers james lee – sterne agee all right thanks for the clarifications dina sorry to be on the same horse again i just want to make sure i have a good understanding of this you seemed to imply that the  million the earn out payment for   that is a negotiated amount not the original amount just curious what was the original amount and it seems like the earn out payments based on the complication formula based on more on the bottom line than the top line and therefore it is very difficult to assess at this point dina liu the original earn out payment amount was more than what we were able to negotiated with them so we have been evaluating given the markets conditions and also evaluating our franchise value since late last year and renegotiated the deal to the companys benefit so we were very pleased to see that inaudible james lee – sterne agee okay i think this is very important for the existing investors who would like to own the stock and just refresh our memory with your renegotiated deal with the acquired agency what would be the acquired multiple be versus before can help us out on that dina liu james this is a very – we have a very complicated formulas in those agreements to protect the company and so what i would say is that we shall be able to reduce the multiples and to our flexibility and now we are confident that the structure that we have in place are accretive to our shareholders value and even our competitive multiple james lee – sterne agee all right thank you helen plummer next question please operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of paul wuh with nomura go ahead paul wuh – nomura hi just several questions for you first on the sectors i wanted to know which industry sectors were the top three contributors to revenue in the first quarter and if they have changed at all from the fourth quarter and my second question is obviously you have added a lot of screens between this quarter first quarter and the first quarter of last year i was wondering if you could give us a sense on a screen per screen in other words the screens that you had existing last year in the first quarter and the screen that you have existing in the first quarter this year what type of like for like revenue are we seeing is it down a certain percentage is it up just wanted to get an apples to apples comparison if possible thank you alfred tong for the first question basically more than  of our revenue comes from three key categories which is personal and healthcare products pharmaceutical products and also food and beverage so these are the more key areas basically personal products are about  pharmaceutical products are about  and food and beverage is about  and also fmcg products i did the same it is essentially the market so started to pickup a lot so the rest of the inaudible into this product and we find that fashion accessories and also tourism is also increasing christopher holbert okay this is christopher i will take your question regarding driving revenue per screen actually as you probably know we dont really look at ourselves in that way some other players in our industry or sector would look at themselves that
