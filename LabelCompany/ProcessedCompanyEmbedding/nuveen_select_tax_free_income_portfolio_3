the battle for cheapest tax prep in  why it makes sense to seach for the right deal and when free doesn’t mean free by ben steverman bsteverman more stories by ben steverman january    am est january    pm est every year it starts again the war for your tax returnthe buzzword for  is “free” turbotax and hr block which dominate tax preparation are battling it out with ad campaigns emphasizing their “zero” price pointsthe fierce competition has in fact made it easier to get your taxes done for free but you could easily end up paying quite a bit more than zero for online tax preparation this year  taxpayers with investments for example can pay more than  for a federal and state return from turbotaxs and hr blocks online services discount online tax preparer taxact now charges investors  double its price at the beginning of last year procrastinators should expect the major players prices to rise further as the tax season goes onsometimes it pays to pay up like if you have an especially complicated tax situation and everyone should try to avoid incompetent tax preparers which is not always easy that incompetent preparer could even be you if youre prone to making costly mistakes doing your own taxes with software whether you use a doityourself online service a storefront preparer or a fancy accounting firm though your taxes should end up looking more or less the same that means you want to save on the feetax preparers promise free work on simple returns to get new customers in the door thats when taxpayers often feel the pressure to upgrade with additional fees for important services such as accessing or importing last year’s return and asking questions over the phonethe bottom line if you have a simple tax return you can probably file truly free of charge through any of the major tax preparers online seven in  americans can use tax software through the free file alliance a partnership between the irs and a dozen preparers the only requirement is an adjusted gross income of  or less a new player is also offering a free product the creditmonitoring website credit karma just started offering tax preparation for no chargefor those with more complicated situations figuring out the best option—the cheapest tax advice that also suits your needs—can require some digging here’s a review of how the top online players—turbotax hr block and taxact now joined by credit karma—are positioning themselves in the  tax seasonhr blockthe big change is with hr block said wedbush securities analyst gil luria “this year they’ve decided to be very aggressive” luria said the company made more taxpayers eligible for free tax filing both online and in its  storefront offices and is luring customers with a new refund productwhy hr block’s chief executive officer is blunt “we did not have a good year” in  ceo bill cobb said in an interview last month “everything that could go wrong did go wrong” hr block processed almost a million fewer returns in the us in fiscal  than in  a  percent drop to  million according to results reported in june to combat turbotax’s “absolute zero” hr block’s  strategy is “more zero” turbotax and taxact will file basic tax returns—the ez and a forms—for free online hr block is matching that while also filing some regular  forms free of charge including those for homeowners with mortgage interest deductions and real estate taxesblock’s biggest line of business is offline to attract millions of additional americans to its offices where it can charge more by offering oneonone tax help it is dangling a few big lures this year for instance the company is offering to process ez forms for free in person down from about  last year and taxpayers who show up may be eligible for an advance on their returnschanges to federal law and irs procedures mean it could take until late february for early tax filers to get their refunds that can feel like a long time for low and middleincome families that depend on large refunds especially from the earnedincome tax credits and additional child tax credits that involve the longest waits hr block’s refund advance program offers filers up to  of their refund in the form of a nointerest loanfinally hr block is trying to improve the experience of visiting their storefront preparers the company hired ibms watson artificial intelligence software to tweak the filing process allowing customers to follow along on a screen as preparers do their taxes on the other side of the desk turbotaxhr block’s pain last year was its archrival’s gain the division of intuit decisively won last year’s tax season with consumer tax revenue up  percent in the  fiscal year and us tax filers up  percentnot surprisingly turbotax is more or less sticking to its  game plan “were feeling good about our strategy” intuit spokeswoman julie miller said this month for simple filers the “absolute zero” campaign offers free federal and state ez and a returns those with more complex returns generally will pay more than if they had chosen discount online tax preparers such as taxact though they’ll probably pay a lot less than if they had hired someone to do their taxes for themgiving away tax preparation to some customers hasnt hurt revenues overall turbotax managed to earn an average of  per us return in  and  up from  in the years before its “absolute zero” offer began in exchange for higher fees turbotax customers get higher technology “we’re really driving a lot of product innovation” miller said citing features such as video chat with tax experts the company has also focused on shortening the amount of time it takes customers to prepare their taxes through the turbotax site and apps  taxacttaxact turbotax’s much smaller rival has said it generally tries to charge at least  percent less than turbo with pretty basic technology and design “we’re really focused on delivering the best value for customers” taxact spokeswoman shaunna morgan saidnonetheless this year taxact has raised prices its “plus” product aimed at taxpayers who itemize or own investments is now  including both state and federal returns up  from jan  and double its cost at the beginning of last year that compares to  for turbotax and hr block’s “deluxe” products and  for their products aimed at investors even with our recent increase we are a fraction of the cost of turbotax and hr block morgan said though taxact can’t price itself lower than “absolute zero” it is trying to make its free product more attractive this year for example it’s offering phone support to simple filers at no chargetaxact is also promising an “upfront price” with “no shady fees” that means disclosing on the opening screen for example that its “free” product includes a  fee to import last year’s return taxact argues that it’s being more transparent about the final price youll pay and if you start a taxact return early in the tax season you lock in that price that protects you from increases that are common to all online players late in the season credit karmaone tax preparation service that won’t be charging any hidden fees is credit karma now promising to do americans’ taxes completely free the creditmonitoring site makes money through advertising recommended financial products to consumersit’s not the first company to try to enter the online tax prep market with a free or very cheap product and those historical examples show it won’t be easy wedbush’s luria said it’s hard for an upstart to attract enough customers “people need to know the product works” he said “they need some confidence that the software can handle their taxes”credit karma founder and ceo ken lin is trying to win over skeptics to launch the product the company bought a small tax prep outfit and is hiring hundreds of preparers to offer support by online chat email and phonestill the product won’t address the needs of about  percent of taxpayers lin said the software won’t be able to help people with especially complicated situations such as those with multistate tax returns your cheat sheet on life in one weekly email get our weekly game plan newsletter sign up and there are tradeoffs tax filers will have to register for credit karma and while lin said the company doesn’t sell customer information to advertisers it does recommend ads to users based on their personal financial data the site will use your tax information to improve those recommendations lin said though filers with privacy concerns can opt out by declining to sync up your tax info early in the processone advantage credit karma enjoys is its popularity it has more than  million members lin said  million people signed up for a waiting list for tax prep the tax product was opened to the broader public just as the irs officially opened for business last monthwho wins so thats how free affects you this year how does it affect the tax prep businessthe trend could hurt profits said oppenheimer  co analyst scott schneeberger the season is “going to be so hypercompetitive that no one is going to have a great year” he predicted the big players are also spending heavily on marketing turbotax has enlisted david
