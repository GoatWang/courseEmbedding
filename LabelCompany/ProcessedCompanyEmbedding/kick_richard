information product examples that kick ass  income ideas  information product examples that kick ass by richard   min read who’s making passive income from ebooks courses  membership sites and what can they teach us if you’ve ever googled around for information product examples to give you that little bit of inspiration and help in choosing your own idea you’ve no doubt come up empty handed unfortunately until now no one has compiled an epic list of the most successful information product businesses out there time to change all that in this article i’ll walk you through over  of the best info product businesses out there i’ll tell you who’s making money exactly how they’re doing it and what lessons we can takeaway as always my focus will be on getting us to dream up our own ideas off the back of these cool case studies by the end you should have several really cool information products in your mind and if somehow you don’t you should checkout this  minimalist path this is an interesting case study that you have to check out because you should be able to relate to it david quit his job and started hunting out some good old passive income he decided to hit up the minimalism niche this was back in  before the niche was insanely crowded side note although a niche like minimalism is packed it is still attractive because big numbers show big interest and well if you examine the average minimalist aficionado eg me we often buy everrrrry single info product on minimalism we can lay our hands on ironic as fck right but true continue reading   think traffic i thought it would be fun to juxtapose expert enough with corbett barr’s main venture being the think traffic blog and it’s associated products including affiliate marketing for beginners start a blog that matters traffic school and more recently fizzle see them all here wow what a difference with the think traffic products corbett is earning well over  a year and that’s being very conservative since it’s based on a post he wrote almost  years ago continue reading   mergers  inquisitions if you had said to someone five years ago that you were going to create a website that taught students how to land investment banking jobs and that you were going to turn it into a  dollar business they probably would have laughed their asses off at you but hey that’s exactly what brian has done over at mi here’s how… continue reading   entrepreneur’s journey i’m focusing here on yaro’s first product launch but before i get into that let me be upfront about this this is a case study of how to make money online by teaching other people how to make money online since yaro had already made decent money online from nonmmo niches essay editing blog editing card game website etc i feel good about including this case study so yaro’s first product blog mastermind was a membership site on making money from your blog continue reading   china direct sourcing i remember first coming across lindy chen’s website a few years ago when i was researching how to import from china for a few ecommerce ideas we were stewing over for any of you who have researched it yourself you’ll agree with me when i say the information out there on this topic is terrible most sites contain trifling bites of barely comprehensible information and almost none contain anything approaching authoritative howto articles continue reading   backyard chickens big regrets laughing when i heard my friend’s dad was feverously researching how to keep his own chickens… because when i found out that this site dedicated to teaching people how to do this very thing was making an absolute killing online with  uniques a month i felt like the out of touch one my bad but wow was i happy to hear it because it confirms once again that just about every niche on earth is full of passionate people that yearn for information and will pay good money for it continue reading   sweater babe i think i mention knitting a lot on this site  it’s just such a good example of a tasty niche since avid knitters are always trying new things and spend weekends locked down in their own lil mini sweat shops aka they’re homes…translation they eat yarn for breakfast and buy a lot of everything i’ve studied the knitting niche a bit for inspiration purposes and i’ve found that the big money makers are obviously information productsparticularly video courses since they are the best way to communicate how to knit knitting supplies and most importantly for this case study at least knitting patterns the diagrams knitters use to make clothes let’s focus on the patterns for a minute continue reading   rc powers hobby planes when i was younger a friend of mine let’s call him vince was a hobby boat nut  i enjoyed it too you know go down to the park put the mini speed boat in the water and hoon around but wow what he spent on it i think the average boat kit was  and then there were all the add ons continue reading   green exam academy you’ve probably heard of pat flynn before over at smart passive income and we’re about to look at his first money making venture online to see what we can takeaway…both the success lessons and the big bad mistakes so green exam academy is a site that teaches architects how to pass the leed exam an exam you need to take to get a license to work on green energy buildings or something greeeeeat idea i know at the time pat didn’t actually think about any of these pointers i’m going to make but we can reverse engineer it all and narrow in on the reasons why someone would want to start this idea continue reading   dc income this is going to be a weird case study but i want to include it because there are some very inspiring lessons in here okay so there’s this dude called dr loop  he’s a chiro but most of his money comes from teaching other chiros how to market their business online through social media seo email marketing etc and also teaching online entreprenuers how to make money online now dr loop is an interesting character  he doesn’t really go into too much detail on his successful ventures i gather this is more reserved for his coaching clients but he does share some very powerful tips especially with this one software product he launched continue reading   zen habits probably my favorite blogger going around leo somehow manages to continually pump out useful content on a swathe of topics related to personal development i love that he continues to advance himself with everything from meditation to raising his kids but what i really love is the amount of passive income he’s generating now hahaha you knew that was coming continue reading   microsoft excel by infinite skills something a little different  as you can imagine this is an information product for people trying to learn their way around excel  what you might not realize without doing anymore research is that this product sells for  and has sold over  copies  buuuuu yao it’s a terrific example of what can be achieved when you teach people an important skill – the kind of skill they can use to increase their earning capacity…kaching styles what skills do you have that would help people earn more money get a rise land a better job etc continue reading   cake decorating for fun  profit cake decorating  yeah that’s right  an information product on cake decorating is a profitable niche  if that doesn’t inspire you to realize pretty much any specialized knowledge you have can be turned into a profitable info product then i don’t know what will this is another case study i’ve plucked from udemy jodi schweiss i love you  jodi is inspiring  here she is with a full time job decorating cakes and yet she made the time to create this course  as with most things udemy related this course is mainly video based continue reading   the minimalists if you’ve read josh  ryan’s blog before you’ll know they talk about how to live a meaningful life  unlike most blogs the quality of their writing is at a professional writer level…and well they are professional writers joshua at least is thanks to their focus on pumping out high quality posts – i mean essays – they have attracted a huge audience  over  unique visitors a month in fact how have they monetized this traffic continue reading   the  workout this is probably one of those passive income ideas i would have had when i was in my early s  after all think about how much time we waste on looking good when we’re young anyways the idea is simple teach people how to get a body like gerard butler and crew in the sparta movie   leveraging off the hollywood effect of a movie is genius  the movie is doing all the selling for you  the movie will get people searching for something like “ work out” or “ diet” or “spartan work out” whatever and your blog on all things sparta fitness related will reel in the traffic continue reading   colette patterns a website dedicated to sewing  oh yeah that’s right  and wow what a hot ass niche – crafting is one of the biggest past times in the world if you are a crafter you need to be thinking long and hard about a blog especially since your passion can drive the content creation machine  that said as you can imagine there are s of blogs on sewing alone so the question becomes…how did sarai from colette execute on her passive income idea to beat the competition well i checked out her interview with corbett over at think traffic and i scoured sarai’s site and here are the big takeaways continue reading   man vs debt adam baker started this site to share the lessons he learnt along with his wife when they set about eliminating their mountain of personal debt a few years ago  the site is thus a personal finance blog but with a focus on eliminating debt  i like focus what’s most interesting about adam baker is how he grew into a real online business builder  starting out with an ebook on how to sell your stuff for maximum profit on ebay craiglist etc he’s progressed to launch a membership site on debt reduction you vs debt as well as a freaking feature length movie one i might add was crowdfunded and not so much profit oriented he was also the cocreator of only which did to information products on making money online what groupon does to small businesses every day – ie bundle deal site continue reading   nerd fitness steve kamb came up with a great idea  take a huge topic in this case health  fitness and then niche it down not based on the topic but rather based on the target audience before going any further think about what this means for you and the topics you know  example say you are a financial planner maybe instead of hoping to teach stock picking for everyone you can niche down and focus on retirees and all their associated specific needs time horizon risk preferences lifestyle fit etc  this is just one of many ideation techniques out there and we go through them all in the idea generating article okay back to it  here’s exactly how steve has killed it online with his fitness website  he wrote a ton of content  he did a ton of guest posts especially on nonfitness websites that he knew would be read by his target audience of nerds eg tech blogs  he created a community around the comments section of his blog and through the massive forum component of his site hello loyal tribe continue reading   chinese with mike oh wow  i wanted to bring you guys a language teaching example and since i was personally thinking of doing a course on introduction chinese mandarin i googled around a bit to scope out the competition  it’s fairly smooth sailing i might say all the sites out there are either from the th century or contentlight sites put up by the bbc chinese tv etc  the one site i came across that offered funny interesting video lessons though was chinese with mike  it’s a site led by you guessed mike he’s a mulletsporting american and a big fan on infotainment  mike’s videos at first give you the impression he is on another planet i like the big ass personality because you can’t click away…hello engaged user but then he whips out pitch perfect tonal chinese the next minute  love it continue reading   harvest eating i first heard about these guys when listening to a pat flynn smart passive income podcast  i loved that pat was finally getting to share a few success stories of making money online that weren’t to do with teaching people how to make money online as someone who created a careers advice membership site myself this was verrrrry refreshing  so here’s the story behind harvest eating  this chef keith snow decided to create a site showcasing awesome recipes for fresh local style eating  he put a ton of content up and then added a you tube channel too – ie he was no longer just writing about his recipes but also cooking them like a mini jamie oliver he rolled the site he had into a membership site where people paid to access all the content  membership fees were either monthly yearly or lifetime  he’s got over  people paid up many of whom would be monthly members at  a month  now i don’t need to do the math on this one you can clearly see this is generating  a month for him assuming half of people take up the discounted options of yearly or lifetime membership continue reading   wall street oasis how do you create a million dollar passive income business  create a community centered around an intense pain and sell info products and services to them all  done seriously that is exactly what patrick curtis has achieved over at wso  let me give you the run down on exactly what he’s created so you can think about what similar community sites you could create…hello jack russel dog training  jack first created wso as a news and forum site  so students interested in landing a job on wall street would come to read up on what was happening funny take on the finance news and would ask each other s of questions on all things wall street related from resume questions to interview hacks continue reading   samurai sales videos this one page site – built probably in less than  hours using the unbounce platform – sells text  image driven sales videos to online entreprenuers eg someone launching an ebook the cost is  and all the work is handled by a team of  leaving about  for affiliates and about  profit per video in the owners hand  how do we know all this after i started following the site i later found it on flippa – an online auction site for websites – and as part of the dd the owner disclosed all these juicy tidbits continue reading   hollywood physique first heard about this product through derek johanson an online entrepreneur who creates and cocreates products for his fellow online entrepreneurs eg course on copy writing course on information product creation and now a course on fitness so it seems to me derek would have advised clay – the fitness expert – on how to create this info product and in doing so i think they’ve created something pretty cool in a niche that is saturated with info products on how to build muscle get ripped and generally become a world beating mofo you can imagine the challenge of launching a successful passive income stream in it would be tough  but here’s what i think the guys have done right continue reading   the gmat coach i’m  sure this is lee burrel’s site which created after being inspired by the four hour work week and i’m  sure he’s making a million plus a year from this based on a video testimonial  case study he submitted to the four hour work week blog  or  years ago  so with that unreserved success established let’s take a look at what he did and what we can learn from it so my understanding is that lee was no gmat genius when he decided to launch this site  what he did was team up with a gmat tutor  already that should be setting of massive alarm bells for you…what ideas do you think would be awesome to launch but you’ve always held back because you don’t think you’re an expert enough  can you find an expert to team up with for example i might be doing something in the sewing niche soon – an ecommerce site drop shipping a particular item every good sewer needs think  searches a month and almost no competition – but i have no freaking idea about sewing  well i’ll find a knowledgeable sewing blogger who knows the subject but maybe is not so good at monetizing their blog and so would love to earn money from creating content for the niche  boom anyways so that is what lee did here continue reading   evernote essentials an ebook on how to use evernote   passive income net a year  oh yeaaaaaaaaah baby  round of pina coladas on brett kelly the author of this puppy i first read about brett on the four hour work week blog and more in chris guillibeau’s  startup book and was blown away what a great idea  find a hot product that is complicated and then create an allinone plain english guide on how to use it  the better your instruction – think screenshots stepbystep instructions and best of all videos – the more you sell the key for me is finding something where the company behind it has not created the greatest support system or how to guide  or where their guide is not comprehensive enough for power users  this is always something you need to check  i mean take optimize press – a complicated wordpress theme that pretty much everyone online is using to sell info products  it is complicated sure  but james dyson’s video tutorial library alone covers pretty much every issue i ever encountered and then some  and he backs that up with a treasure trove of pdf tutorials and what not  you couldn’t make a dime releasing an evernotes essential type product for optimize press  so be careful  anywas back to brett continue reading   no meat athlete very similar to nerd fitness in the sense that matt has taken a very broad niche – running – and niched down based on target audience in this case marathon running vegos for a while last year i was training for a marathon fuelled  by plants and you can imagine my instant attraction to this site as a result  which brings up a bigggg point if you niche down a topic running to marathons and a target audience runners to vego runners you create a site that people who fall into that subniche fall in love with  a site they identify with  a site where they don’t need any convincing – they’ll bookmark it sign up to your email list and even read  articles on their first pass  why  you are speaking to their very heart the information is oh so freaking relevant  i remember my experience with nma was that i landed read for  hour came back to it the next day and bought the ebook  boom  most sites see a  day trust building cycle in order to convert people from first time visitors into purchaserstribesman  i was joining up for this tribe within  hours  i’d hazard a guess that steve kamb over at nerd fitness experiences something similar as would so many niched up minimalist bloggers eg minimalism for families for example  so ideate on all that goodness for a bit  how does nma generate passive income continue reading   ready for raw jennifer is so freaking bubbly i love it  she’s the teacher of this online course on how to cook raw food – and the author of what i imagine is her seofriendly and lead capturing blo learn raw food i think this is a great case study as we get to see a super niche topic – raw foods – in action  it’s interesting to track jennifer’s progress and realize she first published a cook book on the topic before making this video course  membership site  now what a great lesson that holds for us publish a book to get authority even if you don’t sell much it looks good – fyi she sold over  copies of her first book but not money  create a video course to make money to live on  i mean put them side by side her  books sell on amazon for about  each whilst her video course sells for  per year continue reading   paleo plan love at first sight  i’m not a paleo nut at all – i like a me some pasta – but this site is just stunningly designed and what a smart setup in terms of content and products paleo plan is the sort of site that reminds us that in order to success with any passive income idea you need to go all in on it and pour your heart and soul into it at least for a few months  that sort of up front crazyasafox kind of work is what brings about a site like paleo plan you’ve got wonderful multiple streams of income going on here from the oneoff ebook sales of  or more for extended licenses to the monthly membership to their meal plans and fitness workouts website around  a month…recurring the niche itself is great  paleo is a massive trend of the last  years being the younger cool nephew of atkins and given it’s ability to get results seems here to stay indefinitely  in a similar style to px paleo plan helps users solve both food and exercise problems which pretty much doubles it’s income or ability to charge continue reading   snowboard addiction another very cool four hour work week success story  nev’s story is great  snowboard enthusiast moves to whistler  becomes snowboard instructor  works nights at a restaurant  gets laid off from both jobs  gets handed hww by a friend  creates dvd course on how to snowboard like a pro  busts guts to spread word  fast forward  site makes over  a year probably pays about  my guess to his outsourced web developer and personal assistant to keep it running whilst he travels the world  and who knows what the break up is amongst the few other contributors to the site  either way hells yeah there’s so much to learn from this case study  the niche is fantastic since there are so many things to teach about snowboarding from upside down crazy tricks to basic downhilling  and then the related products  oh dear you can affiliate so much stuff  and even make your own training aids like nev has done – he sells a branded bar to practice your balancing  it’s also the kind of target audience where once you sell them one product eg beginners dvd you can end up selling them a handful of other educational training and performance products through some smart email marketing  brilliant continue reading   live your legend i’ve followed scott for a couple years now and seen him grow from just another blogger to become a barrbabauta lovechild in both his awesomeness and authenticity  what i love most about scott is the depths he goes to punch out a post  none of that  word musing shite  no way instead almost every post he launches is a  word essay of epic proportions  this quality is what has helped him build a passive income empire  now before we go any further scott would be the first person to slap me across the face with a dueling glove homer style and say “it ain’t passssssive man”continue reading   sheet music plus a marketplace for digital downloads of sheet music  you can find everything from metallica for alto sax to florence and the machine for cello to be fair this marketplace business model is a big ask of most people  to really crush it you need to create a very advanced website where users can submit their wares for sale etc etc and you need to of course get the traction in the market to become the leading central depository of all things related to your niche  but ask yourself what smaller niche you could become the marketplace for  eg chihuahua clothing continue reading   canadian personal will kit a very simple site by an attorney up in canada that shows us how easy it is to turn your expertise – something you consult with people on – into a product  think about it…every lawyer uses a template  all they need to do is get a website created whack it up and then market with some free articles on will kits for google  autopilot  and anyone out there thinking “oh but i charge  for a will why should i give it away for ” simple  the people buying your will kit were never intending to pay a lawyer   you’re not losing customers to your cheaper option you’re just gaining new customers you would never have had before  and for absolutely zero extra work per client  now obviously the will kit is a very simple and readily available product out there hence it’s very meager  price tag over at canadian personal will kit  but let your mind wonder for a minute  what are harder to find templates and also involve helping people save s on lawyers fees and help them protect their life’s assets  hmmmm separation agreements perhaps continue reading   exchange server pro what a great case study  here we have paul cunningham an it dude who handles microsoft server work for a big mining company in australia  at some point paul realized that all the knowledge he had gained during his job could be handy to other people  so he setup a blog and started banging away on the keyboard about how to do what he does setting up migrating and maintaining microsoft exchange servers  brilliant a boring niche for any of us nonit people but a great example of something that just works  i mean think about it  who is he selling to  well he’s selling to fellow it workers who are scratching their head and busting their guts trying to migrate an exchange server but just can’t get it to work continue reading   fluent in  months benny the irish polyglot  yeah that’s pretty much the brand of this personalitydriven website that teaches students how to learn any language in just  months  i freaking love this passive income example because it shows you exactly how to create a kickass muse first let’s look at the idea  benny doesn’t teach languages  he teaches people language learning systems  so in that sense it’s kind of like all those courses out there on things like improving your memory optimizing your thinking etc  what a smart angle i mean think about it  there are already a ton of resources out there on different languages – it’s crowded  but what about rapid language learning as a whole  not so much continue reading   management consulted this site is aimed at students and young professionals looking to break into management consulting  it’s another great careers advice site with a slew of info products on offer the model with mc is simple tempt students in with great free content then put them through a free ecourse and then once enough trust and desire has been built in the content itself offer the paidfor comprehensive and structured version as with pretty much any career advice info product this one benefits from the fact that students are in desperate need for the product  they’ve just spent  on an education and now need to beat  other students to one spot  we are talking desperate times continue reading   simple fitness habit collaboration is the name of the game here  sfh is a joint venture between  or so experts in the personal development and fitness niches  you can imagine what this means  content is created in weeks  marketing is done with some simple blog posts  product looks amazing  sold sure you have to split the sales but still  what a great project  who can you collaborate with on an idea  this is a great example of bringing multiple skills to the table and producing a product that is greater than the sum of it’s parts  sfh is a membership site which allows people to join up for   or  months depending on their seriousness or time requirements continue reading   make iphone  ipad games in  hour can you think of a more enticing title for an info product  nup me neither  it really speaks to people’s pains of wanting to get into software development but fearing that it’s way outside their reach  perfect pitch  so this course is offered on udemy which i’ve talked about before – it’s a platform for creating and selling courses  check it out to learn more so what i love about this info product is that it’s so smart in it’s focus  it’s not teaching people how to develop all kinds of apps it’s just focused on games  this is different to  of the other courses out there that hope to teach everything and end up teaching nothing  there is also that idea of people saying ‘this is exactly what i’m looking for’ when they see a very specific course like this you sell them in seconds  and the way john bura delivers the course – in true udemy style – is  video continue reading  want passive income ideas that actually work if you’re struggling to think of an idea or you’ve tried out a few ideas but can’t seem to eek out more than a couple hundred dollars a month stop i’ve already spent s of hours researching and testing all kinds of ideas i know what works and importantly what doesn’t here’s  of my favorite ideas that actually work copyright   real passive income ideas  disclaimer

ciaran carson friday  august   edt first published on friday  august   edt the kickby richard murphypp granta £ richard murphys mother was ambidextrous and it was all the same to her whether she wrote backwards or forwards she used to have to ask someone on which side of a blank page she ought to begin when asked to state her nationality on forms in ireland during the second world war she used to write british and irish the family believed that no one spoke english as well as the angloirish and that the angloirish were the best administrators in the empire richard murphys father was the last british mayor of colombo the capital of ceylon now sri lanka young murphy was taken out there at the age of six weeks having been born in a damp decaying big house in the west of ireland he was shuttled back and forth for some years between these two extremes of climate like a kind of hyphen he could be an awkward child once when he was brought to see his greataunt bella at her rooms in the royal hibernian hotel he ran across the room and kicked her instead of thanking her very much for the lovely tea party in  at the age of nine a boy with a beautiful voice he passed an audition to enter canterbury cathedral choir school as a boarder here he received the best education absorbing himself in books especially the bible the awe with which i read it obscured my mind with the dense illumination of stained glass he also learned to masturbate with his left hand he acquired a waterman fountain pen using his right hand to compose letters and poems to his mother the school authorities issued vague warnings against the dangers of selfabuse murphy saw a boy carried away in an ambulance with his hands tied to a stretcher because he could not stop for a moment except when he fell asleep he looked very pale an older boy in murphys dormitory would climb into murphys bed with a jar of ointment this boy was known as a monitors kick a boy that the monitor fancied but any thrill pleasure or excitement could give one a kick so murphy would try to absolve the guilt of his nighttime kicks by daytime immersion in history literature and music murphy went up to oxford where genteel but poor he was the worstdressed undergraduate in his college ken tynan arrived wearing a suit made of billiard cloth murphy was taught by cs lewis he met stephen spender and thought of becoming a poet on his way from london to connemara in june  murphy stopped in dublin and met patrick kavanagh in mcdaids pub he asked the poet how he might obtain a copy of his book the great hunger which was out of print kavanagh told him he would be calling on mrs yeats that afternoon and if murphy could give him  shillings he would get a copy of the cuala press edition from her and give it to murphy later that day in mcdaids kavanagh took the money and murphy didnt see him again for five years more anecdotes of poets  roethke lowell and james dickey among them  follow interspersed with meticulous accounts of the mechanics of the building and sailing of galway hookers or of designing and building houses of local connemara stone subjects that murphy has devotedly worked into his poetry sexually ambivalent he managed to marry happily at least for a while he and his wife patricia were dining with conor cruise obrien when raising a glass of wine to her he quipped le sang du pauvre and his eyes turned up as if inside his head showing their whites then he seemed to recognize and smile at a friend at the far end of the bar again and again he did this usually after a witticism in french i wondered whether we might ask the friend to join us another sophisticate who might have amused patricia but in a quick glance over my shoulder i caught sight of conor in a mirror on the far wall of the bar smiling at himself it later transpired that patricia and conor cruise had been having an affair in  ted hughes and sylvia plath came to stay with murphy in connemara at dinner sylvia gave him a playful kick under the table hughes left the next day without saying goodbye to his host in the late s murphy returned to sri lanka and was inspired to write the mirror wall versions of poems  a type of sophisticated graffiti sometimes erotic  inscribed on a long wall of polished plaster in the remote fortress of sigiriya the old sinhala language in which they are written is full of ambiguity in modern sinhala the idiomatic word for the english language is kaduwa a sword the language gives murphy a kick the kick  a memoir which is by turns funny quirky and lyrical  prompted me to return to the poems armed with new and interesting perspectives on their creation inexplicably faber dropped richard murphys poetry from their list some years ago but a handsome collected is available from gallery books of loughcrew oldcastle co meath ireland it makes the perfect mirror to this volume in the roof of the room where richard murphy was born there is a nest of
