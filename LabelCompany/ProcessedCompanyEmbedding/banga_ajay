started a campaign to give identification numbers to all its  billion citizens ajay banga the newly minted chief executive of mastercard arrived in town eager to lend a handthe program will identify people based on fingerprints and retina scans and could make it easier for the government to route food stamps and other payments to people below the poverty linemr banga says he believes he has a simple way to process the payments via the mastercard network“i wasn’t educated in the us i was educated in india i understand what you are trying to do” he said during a news conference at the trident hotel in the financial center here “i think it’s a huge opportunity for our government and people and companies like ours”though mr banga has risen to the top ranks of american business the roots of his success are firmly planted in india where he was born raised and got his start in business his success at mastercard may well depend on india too advertisement continue reading the main story observing that  percent of the world’s transactions are still in currency he has declared a “war on cash” to nudge as many consumers as possible toward electronic payments preferably processed by mastercard although competition to handle payments is intense in the united states the wider battlegrounds are in countries like india and brazil which have vast numbers of people without bank accounts and a growing middle class continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story capturing only a small fraction of those customers — with prepaid debit cards mobile payment systems or credit cards — could exponentially expand mastercard’s business and profits “whether it’s  million or  million it’s a lot of millions” says mr banga referring to estimates of the size of the emerging global middle class over the next five years or sonevertheless mr banga  is taking over mastercard as it faces huge challenges from new rules governing credit and debit cards in the united states to nimble new rivals offering online and wireless transactions and of course there’s visa its much larger rival“visa and mastercard are going to have to generate new business and that’s overseas” says david robertson publisher of the nilson report an industry newsletter “what you want to do is find new virgin territory where the margins aren’t compromised by competition”in mr banga mastercard believes it has found an ideal if unconventional candidate for tackling such tasks a sikh with a jetblack mustache and beard mr banga says he loves fine wine the new york mets lady gaga elvis presley and sikh spirituals in no particular orderduring a recent dinner of southeast asian food at the luxurious imperial hotel in new delhi he teased vicky s bindra a regional mastercard president for ordering khichdi a simple indian dish of rice and lentils mr banga ordered the  tasting menu and a  bottle of tuscan wine “it’s a  bottle in new york” he notedhis globetrotting identity and animated personality are in jarring contrast to previous mastercard chief executives who were typically buttoned up american and often ivy leagueeducated“he brings a different vibe a different sense of urgency to the company” says adam frisch an analyst at morgan stanley “i expect mastercard’s velocity to change” advertisement continue reading the main story for example mr banga shook up the company by declaring that any request to headquarters not acted upon in two weeks would be automatically approved — a directive meant to speed decisionmakingfor its first four decades of existence mastercard — originally known as mastercharge — was owned by the nation’s banks and was a reliable cash cow for them visa was also owned by the same banks so there wasn’t much headtohead competition between the twononetheless mastercard developed a reputation for being more conservative and flatfooted than visa not only was visa more aggressive in pursuing the debit card market in the united states which it has come to dominate but it pushed ahead of mastercard in the nascent prepaidcard market and in pursuing new business in developing countries in latin america and asiathe differences became apparent when both companies went public — mastercard in  and visa in  mr frisch says investors believed that mastercard had a “phenomenal” business model and a wellknown brand indeed mastercard’s stock price has risen more than fivefold since the company went public photo born and educated in india ajay banga brings a globetrotting sophistication to mastercard credit kainaz amaria for the new york times but when visa went public in  investors found that visa’s execution in important growth areas was even better visa’s market capitalization is now nearly twice that of mastercardlast year mastercard reported profit of  billion on  billion in revenue compared with visa’s  billion in profit on revenue of  billion in the fiscal year ended in september “visa was perceived as a faster more entrepreneurial company” mr frisch says “it appeared that mastercard was more satisfied with maintaining the status quo”mr banga’s hiring was a bold though perhaps belated effort by mastercard’s board to change all that advertisement continue reading the main story mr banga has made a long circuitous journey to the leafy confines of purchase ny where mastercard’s campuslike headquarters sits across the road from regal estateshis mother was the first member of her family to earn a college degree his father was an officer in the indian army and the family moved often mr bindra the mastercard executive who has known him for nearly a decade says the family’s military imprint is visible in mr banga’s continuing desire to please his parentsmr banga is also close to his older brother manvinder who rose to the top ranks at unilever and is now at the private equity firm clayton dubilier  rice in london his sister deepa dhodhi lives in houston and is a business manager for a trading houseonce out of college mr banga began his career in managementlevel jobs in india for nestlé and pepsico where he scrubbed toilets and breaded chicken at kentucky fried chicken then part of pepsico to get a sense of what running a restaurant was like he also got his first taste for americanstyle fast food and marketingivan menezes chief executive for north america at diageo the liquor conglomerate first met mr banga when they were  and studying at delhi university they had much in common their fathers worked for the government and both had older brothers who were “legendary” students mr menezes sayseven then he says mr banga stood out for his smarts and his ability “to connect with people”later they attended graduate school together and both joined nestlé in  when it had a relatively small footprint in india “they sent you out for the first  months in the most remote parts of india” says mr menezes who is also diageo’s chairman for the asiapacific region

every product they introduced seemed to catch fire and nearly every night they would socialize with a close group of friends “we kind of sat next to each other and worked hard and partied hard” he says “what you see today is the same ajay”mr banga joined citigroup in  and quickly rose through the ranks hopscotching the globe along the way he moved his family — his wife ritu and two daughters — to london brussels hong kong and new yorkdinyar s devitre who was in charge of europe and the middle east for citigroup hired mr banga as his righthand man in the late s he praises mr banga’s smarts and his ability to take on difficult tasks for example after mr devitre assigned him to take over citi’s relatively small operations in central europe and the middle east mr banga built them into major businesses advertisement continue reading the main story “he made things happen he made whole cloth out of the businesses in those markets” mr devitre says “he knows how to navigate a path through obstacles by getting the cooperation of the people he is working with”from  to  he ran citifinancial in new york which offers mortgages and other consumer loans when mr banga arrived the division was being investigated by the federal trade commission for possible predatory lending practices his task was to clean up the unit which became part of citigroup in an acquisition the inquiry eventually resulted in citigroup agreeing to a  million settlement in from  to  he oversaw north american retail banking a vast network of branches and consumer products that included mortgages student loans and car loans he took over the international consumer business in during his citigroup tenure the bank came under considerable fire for some of the mortgages and credit cards it offered and for investments in exotic financial instruments the latter nearly caused citigroup to go under in  and  but the bank was propped up by a government bailout photo in mumbai ajay banga spoke of using mastercard’s network to process government payments credit kainaz amaria for the new york times a citigroup spokeswoman said mr banga was not involved in mortgagebacked securities or other financial instruments that caused citi’s problems when asked what he gleaned from its woes mr banga said he had nothing to do with them and declined further commenthis last job was supervising citi’s highly lucrative asia pacific region from hong kong where he oversaw china vietnam and other developing markets — now fertile territory for mastercardmr devitre says he believes the fact that mr banga is a sikh has ultimately worked to his advantage despite an occasional uncomfortable glance or comment he says it takes a lot of conviction to wear a turban a central tenet of sikhism at an americanbased corporation “people look at him and say ‘he wears a turban and he made it to the top he must be extraordinarily gifted’ ”for all his international experience at citi mr banga also traveled extensively in america going to cities and towns from shreveport la to billings mont he has decorated his relatively modest office in purchase with souvenirs including a miniature cowboy boot from dodge city kan with a “made in china” sticker on the bottom advertisement continue reading the main story at citigroup mr banga was on a short list of potential chief executives but when mastercard called in  he was hired as chief operating officer with the understanding that he would soon run the companyhe took over on july  in one of the most difficult periods in mastercard’s history the global recession had curbed credit card use and the new government regulations have cut into the profitability of credit and debit cards — and weighed down mastercard’s and visa’s stock pricesat the same time new technologies threaten to upend the traditional dominance of visa mastercard and american express particularly as payments move to mobile devices in india banks and the government for instance are experimenting with mobile money transfer systems that could keep mastercard and visa — and the fees that come with them — out of the loopwhile acknowledging the obstacles mr banga says the challenges are far outweighed by the vast opportunities for electronic forms of paymentbesides the opportunities in developing countries many governments and companies are viewing plastic as a more efficient way to pay people particularly those without bank accounts some social security payments are now available on mastercard prepaid cards as are some paychecks school refunds and tax refunds“cash is expensive cash is inefficient” he says “you have to print it transport it secure it store it and change it”during his recent visit to india he announced an investment in an indian payment processing company but he was also looking for broader opportunities like the identification programof course the indian government could find other networks for payments but mastercard hopes that mr banga’s ability to glide among cultures languages and borders gives it an edge advertisement continue reading the main story those skills were on display during his recent india trip in mumbai speaking in hindi he joked with waiters who were trying to have him eat rasmalai a rich milkbased dessert flavored with cardamom and pistachios “if i do will you come to the gym with me” he askedat a dinner in delhi with colleagues from new york and singapore he spoke animatedly in english about how much he liked “freud’s last session” an offbroadway production about a hypothetical meeting between sigmund freud and c s lewisasked if his coming of age and his education in india might explain his success mr banga says “i really don’t think that defines me”he also brushes off questions about his appearance “people say ‘how does it feel to be looking like you working in the west’ ” he noteswithout skipping a beat he replies in fluent hindi “what difference does it make” correction october   an article last sunday about mastercard misstated the title of one of its executives vicky s bindra he is president for the asiapacific middle east and africa region he is not a

playlists meet ajay banga ceo of mastercard  sikhnet skip to main content you are herehome meet ajay banga ceo of mastercard four years after taking the helm ceo ajay banga has turned the payments processor into an innovator july   four years after taking the helm ceo ajay banga has turned the payments processor into an innovator the stock’s response priceless banga at the company’s headquarters in purchase nyphotograph by mackenzie stroh for fortune ajay banga loves to talk about the wonders of a cashless society but every now and then it can backfire at his first offsite leadership meeting after taking over as president and ceo of mastercard he gave his senior team a spirited speech about the downside of cash—it’s hard to track it’s used for drugs weapons and tax evasion and it’s expensive to make just the cost to produce and distribute it can run the central bank of an average country up to  of gdp as he concluded his remarks one of the executives in the room at the fontainebleau in miami challenged banga to show the group how much cash he had on him banga opened his wallet and pulled out  at which point the group chided him “the others basically said ‘what a cheap guy—he can’t even tip the bellboy’ ” banga recalls “and they were right i didn’t tip the bellboy” banga espousing the benefits of going cashless is a little bit like howard schultz saying everyone should drink coffee—after all this is a company that makes money on transaction fees every time someone uses credit instead of cash—but banga is a man on a mission even if it means coming off as a cheapskate once in a while these days banga has a lot to talk about when he took over mastercard exactly four years ago the company had recently gone public and disrupters like square and paypal were starting to make waves in mobile payments now the company most people associate with a piece of plastic is going virtual digital and biometric it’s experimenting with facialrecognition software mobilepayment systems touchless transactions and its own idea of a “digital wallet” that it thinks can succeed where others have failed it is using big data to give its customers better insight and it has a googlestyle moonshot lab for experimental new ventures banga is hardly a native technology ceo—a consumer products lifer he cut his teeth at nestlé in india before jumping to pepsico’s restaurant division and then to citibank—but to hear him talk philosophically about a “world beyond cash” he sounds more like a silicon valley futurist than a paymentprocessing executive welcome to mastercard  credit cards are a funny business for one thing companies like visa  v   and mastercard  ma   are not technically credit card companies they’re paymentprocessing companies effectively acting as the middleman in the transaction between consumers merchants and credit card issuers typically a bank both mastercard and its rival visa were in fact once owned by banks mastercard by an “association” formed in  that included wells fargo  wfc   bank of california and first national and visa by bank of america  bac   it was originally called the bank americard in  the “interbank card” as it was called was renamed master charge then mastercard in  even after the two went public—mastercard in  visa in —they carried their legacies with them the card brands remained heavily influenced by the banks that had owned them between visa and mastercard  ma   it’s a twohorse cokeandpepsistyle race visa is the larger of the two with  billion in  revenue to mastercard’s  billion and  trillion in global spending volume to mastercard’s  trillion american express is much smaller by that metric at  billion but while visa is bigger mastercard is growing faster in places like europe american express has more revenue than either one at  billion but has a different business model who’s in your walletit’s not about how many cardholders but how much they spend above global purchase volume of the biggest names—alexandra mondalekgraphic source the nilson report whos in your wallet its not about how many cardholders but how much they spend below global purchase volume of the biggest names banga faces two big hurdles to get customers to choose credit over cash and when they do to get them to choose mastercard  ma   the first is being helped by a societal trend toward credit over cash see “the death of cash” the second is more of a challenge when as even banga admits the two brands are interchangeable in consumers’ minds since both are accepted nearly everywhere “they’re both ubiquitous” he says banga believes the key to getting consumers to reach for mastercard instead of visa lies in offering technology that makes the purchase experience smoother for customers and merchants and so from day one his aim has been to make innovation a priority the first thing you notice about banga  is the thick black beard on his face and the elegant black turban atop his head the turban is central to sikhism banga was raised sikh in pune india the son of a retired indian military general but is a rare sight in us boardrooms in a graduation speech at new york university’s stern school of business in june banga conceded as much “i tend to stand out in a room” he said “turbans and beards will do that to you” he joked that being randomly searched at airports is his “parttime hobby” the next thing you notice about him is his humor he teases colleagues and makes fun of himself frequently he talks candidly and swears for emphasis but that frankness and ability to disarm earn him respect “ajay is the most intelligent person i’ve worked with in my life” says one senior colleague who did not want to be quoted for fear of looking obsequious “it comes down to his confidence he is deeply at ease with himself” when he first joined the company banga walked the halls and struck up conversations asking people who they were and what they did employees weren’t used to it one alum who worked at mastercard for more than a decade says the culture was “extremely conservative” before banga the company’s headquarters in purchase is a sprawling squarefoot building designed by im pei that mastercard bought from ibm in  the open hallways flooded with natural light are beautiful but like any corporate campus spread out and impersonal that’s changed a little under banga the company recently ordered  xootr scooters for the  employees here to use for getting to meetings stuffed monkeys hang from trees in the “conversation suite” a new interactive social media center and of course at the cafeteria and at various coffee carts only mastercard is accepted—no cash credit card processors are in a way the original technology plays mastercard’s core competency after all has always been the technology infrastructure that connects more than  banks to  billion cards that are used at  million merchants in  countries but banga doubled down on technology he launched an inhouse innovation arm mastercard labs in  when he was still coo paypass its contactless technology was rolled out in  and is now used by more than  million merchants in  countries masterpass the company’s digital wallet it stores your personal data to more quickly complete a purchase from any device using any brand of card followed in february  and while digital wallets have had questionable success—google wallet square wallet and visa’s original digital offering vme all failed to gain traction—mastercard is making masterpass its biggest digital push yet with constant product updates and as of this month the ability to purchase from within apps rather than just at mobile websites to win in the digital payments market “you have to have some basic capability in the physical world and some capability in the digital world” says ed olebe who worked in emerging payments at mastercard and left this year to start his own mobile commerce company “and what a lot of these smaller newer companies find is that it’s very hard to make a dent in the physical world the players who can handle the digital challenges and the security challenges and keep a presence in the physical world will win and that’s mastercard” to run mastercard labs banga tapped garry lyons a yearold irishman who came in as part of the acquisition of orbiscom a dublinbased maker of paymentsolution software the company bought in  banga gave him a long leash “garry is geeky—it’s like he’s got add” banga says “i told him ‘here’s the money knock yourself out waste it buy booze if you like i don’t care but if you don’t give me stuff to launch i’ll fire you all’” last year lyons held an “innovation express” where he put a group of his techies in a hotel room for  hours and told them to create a new product one product from mastercard labs is shopthis which lets customers purchase items from within a magazine app—click on an ad for cologne for example and buy it right there banga also made lyons seen as a star within the company mastercard’s chief innovation officer lyons says it’s a comfort to have a ceo who is committed to technology “we have the right guy driving the bus” ajay banga mastercard ceo ajay banga stands in the atrium of the company’s headquarters in purchase new yorkphotograph by mackenzie stroh for fortune ask banga what other technologies mastercard has up its sleeve and he offers a string of examples some of them apps some just small features that bring big convenience he loves incontrol which lets you carry just one mastercard but set it to charge either your credit or debit account for purchases above or below an amount you choose it can also work like parental controls on a television restricting the type of store where the card can be used or banga points out it can help curb your starbucks addiction set it to limit your spending there each month to say  and “at  it’ll send you a text and say ‘hey dopey guy you’ve reached  next time you go what do you want me to do’ ” that all may sound pretty simplistic but it’s something mastercard has patentprotected for the next  years other innovations are in play overseas the company is working with governments in countries like south africa to issue cards that contain biometric data it has ramped up fraud protection in the wake of the  target breach as have all its competitors and it is starting to use big data to enhance existing services most notably for its smallbusiness customers its market vision reports now tell small businesses how they’re doing as compared with an aggregate of similar competitors in the area analysts say banga is succeeding in his mission “there are many times where i see mastercard make headlines first” says barclays analyst darrin peller who rates the stock a buy “i think that’s their culture now they are trying to be extraordinarily innovative” the stock is up nearly  over the past year compared with the sp’s gain of  in the past five years it’s risen  visa has climbed  in the same time much of the opportunity for the company is in parts of the world where a digital wallet is still decades away it is zeroing in on the  billion people in the world who are unbanked or “underbanked” banga cochairs the world economic forum’s financial steering committee in lebanon and jordan it partnered with the un world food programme to give syrian refugees ­mastercards loaded with  per week for food in political crisis zones like russia and egypt many government employees get their salaries on prepaid mastercards when chaos hits banking systems freeze and cash becomes unavailable their cards are still automatically refilled of course mastercard’s competitors are pushing innovation hard too last month visa announced an ambitious digital venture visa checkout amex recently hired a former paypal executive as its cto while paypal has made its payment technology available in brickandmortar stores through a partnership with discover bitcoin continues to gain momentum and apple is rumored to be working on a digital wallet it filed an “imoney” patent in january despite all this and for all banga’s talk about a cashless future the vast majority of the world’s transactions—some —are still conducted in cash if anything the argument could be made that the longheralded end of cash has been overhyped and is still many years away ann cairns mastercard’s head of international markets offers a more cautious take “there is going to be a continuum where cash cards and mobile exist side by side for a significant period of years” she says however long the transition takes with banga’s eye trained on technology mastercard looks well positioned to lead in a postcash world maybe he can even find a solution for tipping

transcriptmay  about mastercard incorporated ma mastercard incorporated nysema bernstein annual strategic decisions conference may    am et executives ajay banga  chief executive officer analysts lisa ellis  bernstein lisa ellis we’re delighted to kickoff the conference this morning i’m lisa ellis bernstein’s senior analyst covering payments and it services and i’m delighted to be joined this morning with ajay banga the ceo of mastercard in keeping with the conference theme the focus of our fireside chat today will be on mastercard’s strategic opportunities and challenges as always questions from the audience are welcome please write them on the note cards that you have on your table or under your chairs and pass them to one of the ushers he’ll bring them up to me let’s get going ajay banga sure lisa ellis ajay so at your recent investor day you outlined three overarching objectives of mastercard’s business strategy you framed it grow diversify and build can you briefly describe the elements of that strategy ajay banga i should have added consistency i’ve been saying grow diversify and build from the day i joined eight years ago it’s a  the logic is very simple the logic is that i spent half my time growing the core of our business which is the credit debit prepaid and commercial payment functionalities and it’s not the card you could be delivering it on a phone or a fingerprint or through any method but the idea is that since it’s a consumer business they either pay in advance pay now or pay later there is no fourth way to pay and that’s kind of prepaid debt credit and so sticking to the core of the functionality of why consumers get involved to the payment system is what that first of growing the core is and of course there is a commercial business in there so it’s kind of those four pillars there then there is the idea of diversifying customers we used to eight years  years ago focus our attention on large banks as being the principle source of how we got our business our issuing business i think that changed over the years as you can see we not only talk to large banks but to smaller and regional banks in many more countries around the world we’ve got many more offices than we used to we deal with telecom companies governments digital players merchants a whole range of players transit authorities who help us now reach consumers in different use cases that’s  i would say i roughly turn the company that’s  of our time and then  of our time is spent on building new businesses and that is from services which include loyalty and information and data analytics those kinds of businesses and now of course that includes the alternative payment stream that gets enabled after we acquired vocalink so it’s not really meant to be    it is just a way to communicate to thousands of employees that you cannot only focus on the core you’ve got to focus on these other two things because our industry is in a space where the change around us is pretty fluid and pretty constant and playing to only what your assets were is not a good way to keep yourself around for the next  years and that’s the logic of the grow diversify and build one last part lisa is that you can’t do that without some assets that you have the brand is important obviously data is really important one of the things that my predecessors did many years back was to build a single unified data warehouse for the whole company and all our data flows into that and we’ve got a substantial warehouse where you can imagine people call it in terms of multiple size of the national weather laboratory and what we have is data does not include your name so i want to make sure people know that because i’m not in the consumer business i’m in the bbc business not in the bc business so their names not with me but when you get  billion transactions on with account numbers and dollar value and merchant name and time of transaction that’s gives you a pretty powerful set of data to play with and then you bring artificial intelligence tools on that and you can do lot of interesting things with information and data without crossing the line on who you really are as a company so the combination of brand and data with some excellent people are the foundations of the business but if that grow diversify and build that’s fundamentally what our strategy is lisa ellis so perhaps the biggest event in the last few months for mastercard was the acquisition of vocalink which just closed a few weeks ago so can you describe how the vocalink acquisition fits into or changes the strategy that you described ajay banga we closed that transaction on the st of may we got approval from the uk payment systems regulator and the competition authority there at that time so we’re now literally into our third and fourth week of actually being able to be part of that company from the scratch the idea of picking up vocalink came about some months back we’ve been looking at getting into ach ach is while it’s a relatively small part of consumer payments as to the pretty large part of consumer to utility consumer to government and of course bb and the market that we’re interested in defining ourselves it is not just the consumer payments of a credit debit and prepaid but remember commercial and government payments and we’ve kind of redefined ourselves by the grow diversify and build model so ach came into play just because it’s a large player in a number of those verticals the trouble is that ach is by its nature a very a direct arbiter ph banktobank whatever it’s called in different countries by its nature a very localized business it’s very localized infrastructure with very little that allows for scale cross border and so you end up tending to build it countrybycountry this is  years ago what has changed in these  years is two or three things one is the older ach model which had a basic issue of time taken to settle and clear payments is changing as fast ach is coming into play in a number of countries that is supported both by the regulatory environment and by competitive systems so there is a change going on with fast ach coming in and the second thing that’s changing is that the  a company like vocalink is the only one that had implemented its fast ach software and capability in multiple countries around the world including in the united states clearing house that’s the technology that’s going into the us that changed the nature of the discussion and when this combination of fast ach coming across in different countries and vocalink with its somewhat unique position of being participating in a number of countries in different forms in its model that’s what led to our interest in vocalink and that’s how that whole transaction came about lisa ellis so vocalink appear to have a both defensive and offensive value both protecting your consumer debit franchise but then also as you highlighted giving you an entrée point into bb let’s take that latter one first what is it  why does  why do bb payments remain so underpenetrated by digital payments what is it about bb that makes it so difficult to address ajay banga bb  so you got to step back for a minute and think across large commercial trans and small just think of bb as being in the whole space right which itself is an unfair classification because there are too many differences in that but let’s just take that whole space there are four or five things that everybody there looks for a different levels of let’s say need or desire but the first one is in that payments they’re looking for control obviously they’re looking for efficiency meaning keep the price down they are looking for data so they can reconcile payments easily when you make multiple invoices being paid at a different level for each invoice not being able to reconcile what that was is a nightmare for most buyers sellers and the trading divisions of all the banks that facilitate those payments they are looking for credit in some cases and they’re certainly looking for payment guarantees payment certification so if you can imagine that game card rails play well in some of those and not that well in some of those and they pay better with some kinds of players and less with others so what we’ve been doing in that space even before ach was we built out the virtual card business the fleet card business the purchasing card business our corporate te business and we’ve focused on that in the last three years or four years and that’s why on our investor day a couple of years ago we actually did a whole section on commercial to get people up to speed to what we were doing and why the growth rates there were two and three times out of consumer right and having said that you still cannot get the kind of data connectivity that you need that these people need from a card rail you need connection into the erp system of these companies and buyers and sellers that’s one and the second part is it’s a different cost space so the acceptance of cards in the bb space is not as wide as you would like it to be principally because of the efficiency factor that i talked about earlier so those are two things that hold back card rails being the only possible growth rate for bb but you can build card like rails so for example we have used our technology to work with amadeus which is  if you guys book tickets you book it through sabre or amadeus finally amadeus actually is running the payments through us now and so we can help them with that travel agency reconciliation payments and clearing authorizing and settlement and the like including fx and so when you realize that those rails are capable but they need adaptation well the next step then is is there a way to play with ach itself and use that and that’s kind of what brought us another attraction to ach lisa ellis got it and switching now to maybe the… ajay banga just to be clear by the way just having ach alone won’t make it happen you need trade directories you need connections into erp systems there’s whole a lot of work to be done and that work is being done right that work started some years ago it’s just as you need the ach rail as well lisa ellis to get there yeah let’s talk about the defensive value of vocalink there’s been a lot of debate as you mentioned now about the rise of fast ach so how would you characterize the threat or potentially now that you have vocalink opportunity i suppose posed by fast ach networks around the world ajay banga let me step back for a second and describe a little bit of vocalink to everybody i am not sure how much everyone knows about vocalink it’s  right now that company by itself is the individual operator of the uk’s payment systems to a fairly large degree meaning they run the older ach system they also run the fast ach system they run the atm switch that’s kind of the three things that they do in the uk not only do they provide software but they also provide the rules and processes and they provide the infrastructure to run the clearing authorizing and settlement for all those things right so that’s kind of the nature of the company what they did over the years was they took their software portion and some of their intellectual capacity around creating the rules and processes and some more things around trading applications that could use all the stuff and they started putting that into different markets so they went to sweden and in sweden this is a relatively advanced low cash market it’s a very high digital payments market i mean in sweden this is a true story but it’s a funny joke so it’s early in the morning you guys have all had your coffee you deserve it but if you go to stockholm and you try and use the public loo those green big toilet chaps that you got to unlock the door and go in you don’t do it with a coin you do it with a code on your phone which you then tap into the pad and that connects to your bank account or your card and charges you  kronars so in contact list you call it tap and go i call this tap and go but it’s a different kind of going so stockholm is pretty unique on how far digital payments have penetrated right and so their technology is the one powering the fast ach system in sweden it’s also in singapore it’s coming into the united states shortly it’s in the process of testing with the clearing house as they roll it out it’s in thailand it’s going in there it’s going to a number of countries so back to lisa’s question now about debit i actually don’t  this word defensive on debit makes very little sense to me because there’s so much cash out there but if you stop being defensive about things you’re likely to make full progress against the bigger market that exists i’m sure you’re going to ask me a question on india so i’m going to preempt you on one topic there india has  people talk about india’s demonetization what difference it made good morning yes it did but it didn’t because the moment cash came back it all went right back and yes it’s growing  compared to the prior year it’s  of a pimple on a dimple on an ant’s left cheek in terms of cash versus electronic so the opportunity is enormous in these markets around cash and therefore being defensive around a pimple on a dimple on an ant’s left cheek is really stupid idea and so i’m much more focused on getting at the ant that’s compared to the pimple on the dimple and that to me is the definition of what we’re trying to do with vocalink in the space of pay now which is what you’re calling debit to me pay now could be paid with a debit card or a debit instrument of any type or a phone payment that accesses the same basic functionality with or without a card present but i’m not fussed about the fact that you have a card or a tele card i just don’t care i care about the fact that i want to be enabling that consumer’s choice convenience and security and that’s the game i’m in the choice convenience and security to go after cash so that’s on of the defensive deal it’s an offensive opportunity actually in many ways does that make sense lisa ellis yes all right switching over to services which has been another major element of mastercard’s strategy how should a generalist investor with whom we have many in this room think about the product offerings in services ajay banga that’s a really good question we’ve been doing this conversation on services for a little while and it’s part of that build to grow diversify and build this is in the build the logic was not to build out a service that we don’t have a core competency in meaning i’m not going to build out the ability to hire conference rooms as a service or an event management thing i’m not doing that i’m saying once you use payments and you create data that data provides opportunities and that payment relationship provides opportunities to do more than nearly enable the payment and the insight of that comes from two things one is from a consumers point of view nobody wakes up in the morning dying to make a payment it’s just not what you do and a merchant doesn’t wake up in the morning dying to receive a payment they’re trying to make a business they’re trying to go out for coffee they’re going to school they’re going to work that there is a life and the payment is just the enabler of certain things of that life so if you don’t offer that kind of thinking to a consumer or a merchant or a bank that is actually not just doing payments but it’s trying to find ways to acquire a new customer hold on to an existing customer deepen their share of wallet they’re trying to get stuff done and they are not just trying to make a payment and so we’re trying to make our company say that we can help you get stuff done and that’s where the service comes from whether it’s a loyalty and reward capability including a simple thing like paying by rewards at a point of sale or whether it’d be safety and security for your device for your token for your emv card or a biometric card iris scanning selfie pay hard payment systems all that stuff or whether it’d be the ability for a merchant to decide the menu that they put on the breakfast mcdonald for example moved from breakfast all  it’s only can happen in the us but moved from breakfast in the morning to what’s called allday breakfast which is a really interesting interpretation but basically it’s the nature of things they serve and to serve those things we got to add capacity with fryers and equipment and methods inside a quick service store that very efficiently run to do that it’s a big investment they use our capabilities on hard apt one of our data companies to test and learn and figure out that this make sense where and how that’s just an example so then you start talking to mcdonald’s about payments and you are a partner of theirs not just a payment transactor and to me that’s the nature of the services business is you build off the core of the payment relationship but then you make many more things happen around it that make it better for a merchant better for a bank better for a consumer and that’s what we’re investing in and that’s why that today is about  of our company roughly in revenue terms it used to be  eight years ago when i joined it’s growing therefore the math obvious is growing much faster than the core business it’s been growing somewhere in the high teens in the last three four years i see no reason for that trajectory to change dramatically and so that’s what we’re working on lisa ellis and how do you think about the tradeoffs in investments given you just highlighted there really is still so much cash out there so how do you think about the tradeoff between investing to drive the core business and it attack the cash ajay banga yeah lisa ellis which is diversification ajay banga yeah you  my view of life is that the services business only get stronger if you have a core business because i’m not building it off the payments data stream and the payments relationships so you cannot divert attention to the  without focusing on the  that’s why i laid that    then nobody gets mistaken on what i’m trying to do and half my time  adjective half is grow and develop the core and grow our share there and prepare it for the digital physical convergence that we are all going through and only a quarter of my time is in building new businesses because the other quarter which in building new relationships and diversifying our client base is actually connected to core and to services right so i think of it that way not in the other way around lisa ellis all right let’s transition over to the next big strategic topic all around digital ajay banga okay lisa ellis so one of the hot topics within digital is in authentication and how authentication requirements change when you move into a digital environment can you just talk a bit about that trend how authentication and the requirements around it evolve when you move away from the physical card and then what mastercard is doing ajay banga so can i step back for a second and tell you how important this is to our future than it’s for most people you kind of connect into things with your devices and you think that you’re safe and secure and you’re completely unsafe and insecure if you’re not careful you all go back into your beautiful cars and connect your phone and think that the bluetooth is there and it’s great because now you can call your wife and your husband and your child and shout at them and you can shop for groceries while driving home and buy chicken and put on your oven to get to  degrees in the vision of the internet of things that every tech evangelist you need tells you about or that fill up crap because the issue is first of all why would you want to do that whether in your house or whether in the car and secondly just a small matter hacking into your bluetooth is the easiest thing in the world for a kid of  years old and from their into your car to then be able to change the way in which your car accelerates and brakes is not hard and if you don’t believe me google the topic and you’ll find real facts on that so why am i saying this i’m saying that the internet of things is going to be a reality because there is so much plus points around it from treatment of disease to managing older people to managing the way your information is kept there is no way you should hold it back but it should go and enter into the eyes and ears open about the risk that comes with it and therefore the amount of data that will flow from every device if your refrigerator starts talking to your toaster well that’s a pretty large number of devices talking to each other now there is no reason why a stupid refrigerator talk to your toaster if it does you should know that that’s a mistake and something is wrong and somebody’s hacked into it your refrigerator should be talking to fresh direct if it stops talking to your toaster you got a problem or you don’t even know how to find that today so in the digital world authentication will involve all that it will involve the specific identification of devices that are connected to the internet managing them in a way that their security is protected managing them in a way that when you put a patch on like your apple ios or your microsoft software you get patches updating security how do you plan to update the patch on your video camera that you bought eight years ago that’s connected to the internet there is no way how do you connect the patch on your refrigerator there is nothing you can’t live this is not the way it’s going to be it has to change if this internet of things is going to become a reality the rules of the manner in which technology works and gets upgraded for safety are going to come to reality that’s where the authentication to play that’s completely different from the physical world where the systems have been built for that safety so emv was built for that chip and pin right and chip and signature and my view is that tokenization it just one step in creating emv type security in the digital world because it creates cryptograms and onetime codes and it doesn’t allow the card number to go anywhere just one aspect but the whole authentication topic is the much bigger topic than what a payments company in its payment space will focus on i just think there is a whole digital footprint digital id authentication issue that to me is also business opportunity for companies like ours if we use our skills and capabilities to extend into that space lisa ellis and what is some of the types of things you’re doing at mastercard in that space ajay banga oh for the payment stuff i just couple of examples where the biometric card for example which is just a way of taking biometrics on to a physical pad and making it a much easier for people to be proven to be lisa or ajay at the point of sale kind of should reduce all kinds of balance brought down with that card selfie pay which is actually more reliable than even fingerprints being read because you get more data points of a face other than mine because you can’t see my face but in most people you get data points and so when you get data points you can kind of actually do a good selfie authentication or even further iris scanning which samsung is launching with us in their new galaxy s phone where not only will you will get selfie pay but you will get iris scanning capability to authenticate people there is a ton of these going on selfie pay actually is gone live in a number of countries starting with commercial payments and then headed into consumer payments biometric cards are being tested right now in south africa and going into europe and other countries as we speak so that’s a couple of examples but then that’s hardware and software type and there is analytical stuff so you could do a lot of things with that data and with artificial intelligence applied to it to figure out whether transaction fit patterns whether different behaviors fit patterns so we just bought a firm called nudata a few weeks ago and nudata is a company that looks at the way you use that iphone and how you hold it so if you were to hold it differently from this gentleman here if warren grabs the phone it will tell you this is not the same guy holding it and when he enters the password the way he enters the password it can tell you it’s a different guy entering the same password and the fact that he types with two thumbs and then deletes  times because you got fat thumb compared to warren who has got thin thumbs is also something it will tell you and i’m making a joke you’ll see how simple it is actually if you could figure it out and that artificial intelligence combined with the hardware and software ideas it gave you is just a range of things we’re working on those i think of safetynet which is now implemented by  plus of our issuers around the world some countries have implemented it across all network brands as a way of trapping anomalous transactions it’s back to the idea of your refrigerator shouldn’t talk to your toaster that’s a weird thing to do while if a transaction looks where it should get stopped and that’s the idea so think of safety and security as three steps preventing detecting and then shutting it down if you detect something the idea is to prevent it hence all the biometric cards and selfie pays and alike but the idea is we does through because we will set through is to detect it hence the artificial intelligence and software tools and then the ability to shut it down that’s going to need in the payment system you can shut it down but if your refrigerator does not have a unique ip address which is the problem today but it’s talking to your toaster and sending information out then you got a problem i can’t shut the refrigerator down you can go and pull the plug out which is why some people tell you the best way to be safe is to unplug your devices at night which is like going back to the dark ages that’s why authentication safety security identity management we really need to be careful about it lisa i believe that most consumers value convenience over security because they don’t understand the implications of this internet of things and the security needs that will come with it i consider that to be a huge opportunity that will come up and also something that could be a drag on all our businesses in the digital space if bad things happen consumers lose trust and so it could be a drag as well lisa ellis and are you seeing demand from some of your bank clients to extend some of the technologies you have in authentication beyond the payment into other areas ajay banga yeah absolutely i think the whole idea of using all forms of identifying people and authenticating them that would prevent detect closed down idea of security absolutely you could use it for identifying somebody who is processing a healthcare claim you could use it for identifying people to enter into a library that has otherwise got secret records you don’t want out into there is a ton of them yeah questionandanswer session q  lisa ellis all right well i think usher is collecting questions just a reminder feel free to write them on the cards usher will bring them up let’s talk briefly about masterpass so you now have about  million accounts enabled on masterpass how do the investments or how do you think about your investments and focus on masterpass visàvis many of the other thirdparty payment wallets that you are also partnered up with like the apple pays and android pays of the world ajay banga again i’d say go back to that issues choice consumers they are going to want choice along with convenience and security we take these as their rights and we should so my view is that what i want to see in a masterpass wallet in the future is choice within the wallet as well not just a debit or a credit or a prepaid card but also the money you receive on a remittance from somewhere or the money you got as a gift and so therefore the ach connectivity angle is an important part of creating choice for how a wallet is used but masterpass is not just a wallet because you could use banks also building their own wallets and riding the masterpass rails to create an expectance methodology and a ubiquity of connectivity between them and merchants and them and a person and them and any other business right so and i’m fine with that i want to be an infrastructure player i’m not trying to be a consumer player right so i’m the bbc guy i’m not the bc guy and so that to me is the logic of masterpass and investing in masterpass now we’ve got ourselves in a position where we believe that the masterpass capability must have two characteristics first is it must apply across all channels online inapp and instore because that’s the only way you get choice and convenience right and so it got to be online inapp and instore and that’s the way masterpass has built all three channels and the second part is that i don’t want to make a consumer go through hoops to register to use a masterpass so if they have to go to a website to put card numbers into to put addresses into to put all that into to get the privilege of using a digital wallet that’s a bit crappy and so they could equally go to somebody else’s button at that time enter the data and start using their wallet so what i want to do is what we call digital by default for the issuers which is the idea that the issuers should be able to enable  million accounts  billion accounts  billion accounts at one go and say these are just as a new you used to get a card and your card comes in the mail it has  call xyz you call them and when you call them and give them your home number or your social security number or something they will enable the card and all the functions of the card get lies in that one call it’s not that you got to make one call for purchase protection one call for your credit line one call for your  it’s not that it’s one time the same way it should get live on digital you should be digitally enabled with your wallet to run on masterpass rails like that through the bank and that’s what we’re doing with these institutions rather than getting them to come to our website to sign up to use the wallet so to me that’s a differentiating strategy and it’s completely focused on the consumer experience while leasing the bank in control of the relationships with that consumer just kind of what they want as well similarly when you’re using the wallet you should be able to like take facebook messenger chatbots we’ve launched them recently even subway and fresh direct and a couple of other players jetblue you can go and buy a ticket if you buy a ticket on it it’ll say i’m lisa it’s your facebook messenger i’m going from boston to new york and it will show you the four options in jetblue and you pick the one and it will take you straight from there and to your banks’ online mobile app you can then flip through your card out choose the way you want to pay direct debit ach remittance card debitcredit click on it use a fingerprint or your selfie or your heartbeat or whatever the hell you want to give a chip in your head and then you go from there and that’s the logic of the back into messenger so it’s constantly reminding you of your primary relationship with the bank so digital by default multichannel and now what you got to do and now what we’re going to do is build new features into the wallet build acceptance for it and keep and sending consumers to use it’s the stuff that we do for a living with our regular payments lisa ellis let’s transition ajay banga well you are prolific collector yeah lisa ellis  to a little bit of a different angle on the strategic opportunities and challenges for mastercard which is more the geographic angle… ajay banga okay lisa ellis …and then first let’s talk china so let’s assume for a moment you do actually have the opportunity to enter the domestic market in china at some point here what’s the difference about entering a market like china where card penetration is already very high compared to much of the greenfield development you’re usually doing ajay banga so china has about yeah actually that’s true debit and credit put together penetration is pretty high china has got about  million  million credit cards that are run by basically visa and us   and it has got close to many numbers multiples of that in terms of debit cards but most of the debit cards are used principally as atm withdrawal or not used at all so it’s really a credit and then it’s clubbed with that is the driver of the domestic system our  my view lisa is that getting into if you want to enter china the biggest things we’ll  we have to do is to win share against the domestic payment system because it’s not as though there is a lot of new guys to be carded you’ll have to get your card to be in their wallet as well and then get your card to be pulled out rather than their card that’s the first task and so the second task is you use your card much more frequently so today china still is a fairly large providence of cash despite all the stories we read about mobile payments and wallet payments and cup and the like this is a pretty large cash market and therefore there is an opportunity in the secular growth category but it’s first of all a category of you’ve got to build acceptance when issuing that’s why you find us in the last year or so of earnings call we keep talking about single brand issuance and winning those deals in china the idea is to keep getting your card out there into people’s wallet preparing for the date when you will be allowed to process domestic transactions as well not just overseas transactions lisa ellis and how about alipay are they friend or foe ajay banga it depends i mean outside of china alipay and alibaba aren’t really winning in the payment walls in china there is a pretty unique situation which allowed them to play a very  not just them but wechat and the others i think they do a pretty good job in china and they meet a unmet need of convenience and choice and security although the last part nobody really knows so it’s really about convenience and choice and i think that my view of alibaba and alipay and all the others is we do a lot of work with them on using things like data and analytics to help them identify a fraud on their site sometimes it picks some lot of energy sometimes it’s less energetic and so we can do things with them in the payments space themselves they have traditionally relied on going in domestic directly to the banks and creating bilaterals that’s chaining the people’s bank of china has put out an announcement some months ago saying that all such players need to go to a thirdparty payment scheme methodology to clear their payments meaning you should not be allowed to go over time directly to a bank to create bilaterals you will have to go through a party who that party is it could be china unionpay it could be visa or us as we get the license to operate that and it could be somebody else but even after have to go through somebody rather than just build direct links into all of the banks saying that there is a change going on in the chinese market over the next six months to  months that we should wait and see before we figure out how big or a difficult opportunity it could be lisa ellis and looking a little bit outside of china alipay or ant financial has made a major investment in paytm ajay banga yeah in india yeah lisa ellis in india paytm is a staged wallet model and are not just similar from paypal so what is your sort of strategic or competitive approach to dealing with some of this staged wallet ajay banga so paypal is no longer really the staged wallet that it used to be it’s changed under dan’s last few moves into  i know he is coming up to speak here so i’m sure he will give you his own version of that with paypal so you’ll see it will match what we’re saying the paypal has done what it used to be because no longer steering to ach it now allows the data to flow through cleanly it shows the card art and shows the bank’s brand at the point of sale there is a whole difference going on in the way paypal is operating today i think paytm right now yes it is a staged wallet it’s relying on card inflow as well as ach inflow so we aside paypal a word i think paytm the opportunity in india is so vast that paytm is just one angle of that opportunity but it’s an important angle still a little while ago they used to have an advantage of a cards in online spend in india because you didn’t need the second factor of authentication for them but what did you for a card that’s beginning to change with the reserve bank of india allowing transactions up to a small rupee amount for a  rupee amount that’s larger than most of paytm transactions and they allow that now where you don’t need a second type of a cards as well for online spend so that’s work we’re doing with them to say that you better create a level playing field and then allow the best to win so that you take cash out of the system which is what india’s real challenge is india is  cash in retail spend or if you want an informal number it’s probably closer to  by the time you add the black economy right so there is only a few people a very small tax payers in india the majority of people don’t pay taxes and not paying taxes right now is a blood spot in india and so the government is trying to change that and they’re doing a really good job of going at the issue and they make the mistakes in execution like everybody else but they’ve got a good focus on the topic so that’s very supportive of what they are doing back to the paytm question so it’s the level playing field creation second is that the banks if they feel they’re being front run by paytm i’m going to be the biggest friends of paytm and all the banks in india are pretty active on digital wallets even large government banks like the state bank of india have a pretty good wallet and a fairly focused and devoted group of people running that by the time you go to the private sector banks like icici and hdfc they’re pretty active too so i’d see an issuer driven strategy is having value and i think the combination of those along with ongoing discussions of paytm about how to make themselves more capable of winning the big business is what we’re doing but there is other work to do in india you got to build acceptance you got to build card usage awareness there is a whole set of things from our standard playbook that we’ve got to do in india to really get at the cash and we’re doing some of that there is acceptance work there is  million merchants now are point of sales terminals versus  million before demonetization but just to put in the context there are  million merchants in india now that includes every mom and pop fruit seller and fishmonger which you can’t really get to but as you got to  million merchants in india that still double today’s to raise  million and  million is the large number it’s  million in the us as an example so there is a large way to go a long way to go in india is yet on opportunity lisa ellis well we’re on the discussion of some of the competitive dynamics i’ve got a number of questions in here not surprisingly about paypal now that it had spent a good nine months or so since your partnership announcement with paypal ajay banga right lisa ellis … talk a little bit about ajay banga what you’re saying lisa ellis  of that relationship and just what we might see next what are the some of the next ajay banga so dan schulman and i had a drink together last night so i thought i’m kidding because i know he is coming he told me he is coming and then hey i’m going there too so you’re going to hear from him so you will see i’d say restruc a partnership deal on multiple fronts with them and sort of not to least among that was the renewal of our cobranch with them those are expanding not just in the us but elsewhere and not just in the categories as we’ve signed but you will find over the next few months more of those deals coming out so you can ask dan about that he can give his own view but i consider that to be the proof of the pudding in the fact that we trust each other as capable of running independent competitive shops that are willing to fight with each other but also do business with each other right and that’s when your head is focused on cash not just on each other’s business model so that’s kind of one angle the other angle is that none of that could have happened without paypal’s willingness to change the way they conducted some of their business in a form that made two things or three things possible the staged wallet versus the passthrough wallet idea so the fact that now a transaction can be seen all the way through a merchant of where it’s originating from and what kind of card or ach it came from that’s important to a merchant and important to us it’s important to the issuers they’re are doing that we told them that we would work with braintree to integrate masterpass’ capability into braintree they’re in the process of rolling that out we talked about showing card at the point of checkout they’ve rolled it out in some places it’s rolling out in the rest so to us i’ll tell you that he is stuck by his end of the agreement we stuck by our end of the partnership and i think we’re both benefiting from it you’ll see his business doing very well we’re doing well he is signing up more clients they’re happy we’re happy lisa ellis and i ajay banga the most important thing is that choice and the convenience and the security once you get those three clear in your mind then a lot of the unnecessary noise around the stuff goes away lisa ellis and could you see a situation where you actually end up partnering up with them to tackle some of these global situations or global competitors or just global expansion into some of the greenfield ajay banga we’re competitors as well so masterpass and paypal will compete i can’t see us getting that close to each other the drink is one thing but i wouldn’t go past that one lisa ellis yeah ajay banga yeah i still want to kick him every time i see him that’s a different part of the story because bigger than me lisa ellis good all right ajay banga i’m going to text him after this saying don’t listen to the kick comment lisa ellis all right a number of questions in here about the regulatory dynamics globally ajay banga yes lisa ellis can you in two minutes or less give a brief update on the regulatory environment globally i would say probably ajay banga in two minutes you joked that’s why they laugh lisa ellis particularly highlighting europe i would imagine ajay banga okay okay let’s talk about europe for a second because that’s the most interesting one to us europe has got multiple things going on only one of which is the psd regulatory environment it had the previous circumstance of setting debit and credit interchange caps at  basis points and  basis points and the separation of scheme and processing functionally and all the things that came with it that’s all happened now it’s got the psd stuff looming which basically means that payment systems providers can get setup and can go and tap into a person’s way of paying to settle an account with a merchant and banks have to enable that to happen and banks have to provide the strong authentication to ensure that those payment system providers don’t allow fraud to creep into the system to me that’s a huge opportunity as well because all those authentication services they’re going to need players like us the payment system providers need them the merchants need it and the banks need it the banks because they contractually bound to provider but the other two needed too for their own safety data analytics are all going to need gateway services that all going to need this is all the things we built up over the last eight years i do think that you shouldn’t run away assuming that this is going to change the european payments landscape in a hurry first of all nothing changes in europe in a hurry that’s just a reality because there is multiple countries with multiple regulatory jurisdictions and while you see  ec they don’t they see  ec in their own country and then their own space so it’s a somewhat more complicated trickle down the second is the fact that the interchange rates are so low has reduced some of the oil in the engine to enable new people to come and start engines and start acceptance networks and create parallel methods of expense the stuff is not cheap and therefore in the physical world in particular online is one thing but in the physical world in particular building out alternative acceptance methods is going to be really hard for these dsts and really extensive so i would take a deep breath before you go running away thinking oh my god it’s all changing tomorrow morning and neither am i going away running away thinking oh boy what a great opportunity next year i’m going to make gazillions more through the work that’s going to happen we’ve got a whole war room of people working on it don’t get me wrong but this is what i’m telling you for having studied it for a while but europe is more than the regulation europe is also what’s going on visa and visa europe and the opportunities there for them and for us and we are winning share with the small and medium banks and we’re winning share in the book of the larger banks but that will stabilize over time and then it will become a more regular fight between us and others local players in each country the other part is acceptance is growing in europe you can see that happening with the interchange coming down there is definitely an impact on acceptance and so in new categories as well as existing categories there is growth in acceptance so there is a secular opportunity europe is a very large cash market germany is  cash in the retail business this is an example and germany is not a slouch on technology so it’s got to do with culture and infrastructure and exceptions and that’s all happening as we speak so i think of europe in many forms just as the regulation but there is all the opportunities with secular shift that’s why you can see us growing share in europe and every quarter in our earnings call we tell you that europe is a doubledigit revenue growth for us other regulation to me the market that has got the most movement on regulation will be china as this opening up happens i’d say i don’t know how long it will take for that to happen i don’t know whether it will be as simple as it gets played out sometimes but there is the biggest change will happen there and the other markets there is a always a series of markets that are either going more nationalistic or more open they kind of go back and forth i was in latin america all of last week in argentina brazil and mexico and i would tell you they are more towards opening than not just changes by marketplace lisa ellis all right as we wrapup two quick ones one if you look out what keeps you up at night around mastercard ajay banga other than my own snoring yeah lisa ellis what are the  what do you see as the major risk to your business as you look out over the next three years five years  years ajay banga oh i’d say this entire regulatory arbitrage and i’ll explain what i mean by that i  well i can help work with governments to help them understand the importance of taking out cash just go back eight years ago when i first talked about killing cash and producing studies and the cost of cash people used to go to sleep on me in government locations around the world that’s not the case today they’re paying real attention they care about the cost of cash in their economy so i think that’s a good tailwind but how they implemented whether they’re playing with the level playing field or not whether they see us as partners in that whether they see us as problematic because if the us puts sanction in a country like happened in russia we then have to create a different operating model there is a lot of things that move around from the simplicity of taking out cash to the actual level playing field that is a complex phase and i spend a lot of personal time on managing that and i would say i’ve been some and i will do some in that discussion and that’s obvious because countries will view payments as part of their national security in some ways appropriately so and so they tend to quote systems and process in place to manage that i think that’s the first one the second one is i was talking about that security and authentication i think we should all think i can see brian at the back there and brian and i have participated on different topics in cyber security together if you want to ask somebody about that topic ask him when he comes up you will get bigger earphones than you got from me but we people like us are consciously interested and concerned about the topic we see it as an opportunity to be see it as a threat to all our models if we don’t pay attention to it and we’re on one of the right system around it and so those two are the things i worry about once upon a time i used to worry about the fact that that will we be able to keep pace in technological development look at bitcoin and blockchain and so on i  we’ve built our own permission blockchain they’re talking to different banks about helping them with the permission blockchain we’ve got  patterns in the space quietly just doing it quietly so we  i no longer have the fear of being a participant in the migration of technology other than i may not execute well that’s an execution issue so that doesn’t keep me up at night those two others which are little beyond what i can control of what keeping up at night lisa ellis thank you and just in closing did you want to wrap with we’ve covered a wide range of topics what in your view is the single biggest opportunity for mastercard in the next ajay banga the fact that the cash and check are such a prevalent part of payments in consumer and commercial and they’re inefficient they don’t provide the control you want they don’t provide the data that people want they don’t provide a lot of the functionality that people are beginning to take for granted both businesses and individuals and with technology and in advancing and the methods that are going on i’d see this is a tailwind for some time then i need to keep working hard to exploit it lisa ellis

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
