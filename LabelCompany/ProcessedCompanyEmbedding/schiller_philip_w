schiller computer giant gives marketing chief m to stay put for five years by rupal parekh published on november   heres one way to know your company values your marketing acumen it offers you  million to stay for five years philip schiller thats precisely the carrot apple is now dangling in front of philip schiller its yearold senior vpworldwide product marketing in the hopes of preventing him from fleeing to a competitor mr schiller was among a small group of senior apple executives who were each recently granted  restricted stock units valued at nearly  million contingent on the them staying with the company for another five years the company  which is in the early days of operating under its new leader tim cook  is clearly digging deep into its pockets in order to stem an exodus of its seniormost talent in the wake of the death of apples founder steve jobs a veteran marketer with  years of experience mr schiller is a member of apples executive team and has a big job hes charged with overseeing the companys productmarketing and businessmarketing programs and developer relations he now reports to apple ceo mr cook but was incredibly loyal to the departed mr jobs they worked alongside each other for years and mr schiller even appeared onstage at times for major product launches and demos he even left apple when mr jobs did for a period and rejoined when mr jobs returned in  since then hes been at the forefront of developing and marketing products such as the imac macbook ipod iphone safari and apple tv before apple he worked for macromedia in san francisco firepower systems nolan norton  co and massachusetts general hospital mr schiller wasnt always into computers though he studied biology at boston college and per his  it seems he still follows boston sports teams  the red sox the patriots the celtics and the bruins beyond sports he appears to be into science cars porsches audis and aston martins and rock music including the killers rush and the dropkick murphys according to computerworld the share units will be awarded when they vest and the shares will be worth their thencurrent price which could be different than their current value half of the shares vest in the summer of  and then other half in the spring of march  assuming the executives are still with apple at that time in addition to mr schiller others who were awarded the grants include peter oppenheimer the companys chief financial officer and senior vps scott forstall head of the iphone software group bob mansfield whos in charge of hardware engineering and jeffrey williams operations head who succeeded mr cook in his previous role so if the chief marketing officer at apple is worth over  million how about apples ceo computerworld noted that mr cook has his options already this summer after taking succeeding mr jobs when he stepped down apple awarded mr cook one million shares that vest in four years and again  years worth about  million at mondays stock price
