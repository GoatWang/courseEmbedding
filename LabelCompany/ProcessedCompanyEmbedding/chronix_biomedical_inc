biomedical inc is a molecular diagnostics company offering laboratory developed blood tests for cancer monitoring supplemental evaluations and screening patients at high risk for cancer our mission is to be at the forefront of cfdna technology and bioinformatics we offer revolutionary diagnostics developed by doctors for doctors to detect cancer early precisely monitor  actively managetechnologyin recent years many new scientific findings concerning cancer research have been reported which have led not only to new therapies but also to new diagnostic methods today we know that in a very large number of cases a tumour is indicated by substantial changes in the genetic material of the degenerated cells this difference between the genetic material of the tumor cells and the normal cells of the body can be detected with modern proceduresmany tumors release their cellular content such as dna into the bloodstream eg due to cell death these tumourspecific changes at sufficiently high concentration can be detected and quantified as cellfree tumour dna in the bloodcancer is a disease in which mutations in the genomic dna of an individual cell lead to a disruption of the normal checks and balances homeostasis which in normal state ensure that cell multiplication is matched closely to the body’s needs a cancer cell has lost the ability to respond to homeostatic needs and continues to divide relentlessly in one or multiple metastatic sites eg driven by positive oncogene or lack of negative suppressorgene influencesthese mutations in the already developed tissueorgan somatic cells lead to cancer eg breast lung colon and in the overwhelming majority of adult cancers this follows after the accumulation of multiple mutations there is evidence suggesting that aneuploidy which appears as amplifications andor losses of large sequences of genetic material develops earlier than the bulk of mutations which occur in single dna base pairs this aneuploidy is a major hallmark of genomic changes in malignant cell transformation which occurs early and is the underpinning foundation of our cni scoring assaysthe blood analysis to determine cellfree tumour dna is a new tool which can help in the assessment of the efficacy of drug therapies in tumour diseases the cniscore we provide is reflecting the amount of circulating tumour dnanext generation sequencingnext generation sequencing ngs is a method which allows scientists to determine the sequence of the whole human genome and such dna “mapping” can now be performed on circulating cellfree dna cfdna in the blood that is derived from dying “turningover” cells indeed such cfdna is continuously entering the bloodstream with a turnover half life of some minutes before the body digests and recycles the constituents what has been appreciated is that tumorderived cfdna circulates in the bloodstream with concentrations varying from below  to more then  and can be differentiated from normal dna by the mutational “fingerprint”best detected by the ‘defining’ gains and losses dna copy number instability or cni scoreafter sequencing of the cfdna the individual fragments are uniquely mapped to the human genome according to their respective sequence fragment counts per genomic region are compared to the distribution obtained in normal reference samples genomic regions with fragment counts that significantly deviate from this normal distribution represent regions with gains and losses present in the tumor genome these regions can be compared in the serial sampling and can indicate eg the appearance of a new probably more aggressive cancer clone this information can provide actionable information ngs of cellfree dna in healthy humansbeck j et al profile of the circulating dna in apparently healthy individuals clin chem   circulating nucleic acids cnas have been shown to have diagnostic utility in human diseases the use of mass sequencing and bioinformatics provides the basis for new diagnostic approaches that use cnas as biomarkers for both malignant and nonmalignant diseases breast cancer cfdna with ngsbeck j urnovitz hb mitchell wm schütz e next generation sequencing of
