todays prepared comments by providing a summary of our execution and key highlights during the quarter followed by an update on our  day integration plan for appliedmicro and guidance for the fiscal third quarter of  straight to the results im pleased to report that for our fiscal second quarter of  revenue came in at  million adjusted gross margin was  with adjusted earnings coming in at  per diluted share looking at our end markets networks was up sequentially with and without the contribution of appliedmicro were on  yearonyear inclusive of the acquisition multimarket grew sequentially and was up  yearonyear while aerospace and defense was also up sequentially growing  on yearonyear now let me turn it over to bob to review our fiscal second quarter financials in further detail robert mcmullan thank you john and good afternoon everyone i will review macoms fiscal second quarter results and financial position before i would like to provide comments on our gaap fiscal second quarter results and operating cash flow macoms fiscal second quarter generated a gaap net loss of  million and an eps loss of  per share respectively the results include expenses related to the acquisition of appliedmicro closed on january   including the noncash amortization of inventories stepped up to the fair market value transaction expenses certain change in control payments to former appliedmicro employees and a noncash evaluation reserve of  million for macom’s deferred tax asset recorded as the majority of the  million income tax expense recorded during the second quarter such stepup amortization transaction expenses and change in control payments are common in acquisitions prior to the appliedmicro acquisition macom had an  million deferred tax asset balance representing the estimated after tax value of us nols and other tax credit carryforwards primarily from macoms previous acquisitions the current need for the deferred tax asset valuation reserve and the associated pl expense during the fiscal second quarter was because of the amcc acquisition and related expenses and the compute business will cause a macom us tax loss in fiscal  adding to other us tax losses over the last few years appliedmicro added an additional  million to the deferred tax asset balance macom under gaap rules had to evaluate the reliability of total  million balance on an all or nothing basis with the data that can change quartertoquarter and yeartoyear today it is influenced by macoms previous us tax losses over the past few fiscal years which led us to record the valuation reserve reducing the deferred tax asset carrying value to zero this is an appropriate and diligent way to account for the change in tax environment it is important to note that this evaluation reserve does not prevent macom from utilizing its us nols or other tax credit carry forwards over the next decade the cash payments from the transaction and change in control expenses were recorded through gaap operating cash flow not as part of the investing section of the cash flow statement these onetime payments totaled  million adjusting cash flow from operations for the acquisition related outflows increased to  gaap reported number to  million now to the operating results revenue in the fiscal second quarter was  million growing  yearoveryear and up from  million sequentially revenue including appliedmicro networks was  million and  of total revenues up  yearoveryear multimarket  million and  of total revenues up  yearoveryear and aerospace and defense  million and  of total

million or  and up  yearoveryear nongaap gross profit and gross margin in the fiscal second quarter was  million and  of revenues respectively compared to  million and  of revenues respectively yearoveryear and  million and  respectively on a sequential basis adjusted gross margins increased sequentially to improve product mix in terms of operating expenses total nongaap operating expenses were  million compared to  million yearoveryear and  million sequentially adjusted operating expenses were up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially due to the inclusion of appliedmicro expenses for part of the quarter and higher investment levels adjusted rd and sga expenses were  million and  million respectively in the fiscal second quarter nongaap income from operations and operating margins were  million and  of revenues up  in dollars and  on a percentage basis respectively yearoveryear and up  in dollars and down  or  basis points respectively on a sequential basis the operating expenses include the partial quarter of appliedmicro versus the timing of its quarterly revenues cause nongaap operating margin to decline which we expect to be a one quarter event net interest expense was  million other income of  million represents income from the consulting contract that continues through fiscal  associated with our automotive business divesture our normalized nongaap income tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was  down from the previous  due to the spending mix of international revenues managed by our offshore entities and lower or no tax jurisdictions as the cash taxes we had refunds and payments of  which essentially netted to zero our fiscal second quarter nongaap net income and eps were  million and  per fully diluted share respectively growing from  million and  yearoveryear and  million and  sequentially nongaap net income grew  yearoveryear and  sequentially nongaap eps grew  yearoveryear and  sequentially the share count used to calculate nongaap eps was indiscernible shares adjusted ebitda or earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization was  million up  from  million in our fiscal  second quarter and up  from  million sequentially gaap cash flow from operations were  which included acquisition related cash payments of  million cash flow from operations in the fiscal  second quarter was  million and  million during the first fiscal quarter of  after deducting capital expenditures and excluding amccs acquisition related payments adjusted nongaap free cash flow was  million and  of nongaap net income in the fiscal second quarter compared to  million and  of nongaap net income in the fiscal second quarter of  and  million and  of nongaap net income sequentially turning to the balance sheet at the fiscal second quarter end our cash cash equivalence and short term investments were  million after using a net  million to acquire appliedmicro accounts receivable were  million up from  million sequentially day sales outstanding was  days compared to  days sequentially inventories were up to  million compared to  million sequentially inventory turns were  times compared to  times sequentially long term debt was  million inclusive of capital leases we also had  million of availability in an undrawn credit line capital expenditures in a fiscal second quarter which included  of amccs related items was  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue sequentially depreciation expense for the fiscal second quarter was approximately  million as compared to  million sequentially our investment in capital expenditures exceeded our current levels of depreciation reducing our free cash flow by  million in the fiscal second quarter back to you john john croteau thanks bob lets dive right into it last quarter was a watershed moment for macom we saw a fascinating dichotomy between cyclical weakness in our carrier based optical businesses which was more than offset by strong growth in cloud data centers this underscored our previous realization that this is in fact a separate and distinct growth driver for macom and what is arguably the strongest area of cyclical growth in the electronics industry today cloud data centers based on that realization weve made the decision to focus our resources with top priority on fueling that breakout in what we believe is shaping up to be a predictable high value growth driver for the company for many years to come with rapidly developing backlog program awards and customer commitments its now clear that g in greater optical connectivity in data centers is real and are bigger and far sooner than anyone in the industry has predicted including us in aggregate revenue from our network businesses grew sequentially as well as yearonyear with and without the contribution of appliedmicro global demand in metro and cloud data centers more than made up for a very strong headwinds in chinese carrier based deployments in pon and provincial networks once again this highlights the virtue of our diversification strategy across regions and markets channels and products which is once again delivered growth despite choppiness and notoriously cyclical carrier deployments last month at roc we observed a distinct transition from a carrier centric to a client centric focus for the show that included macom for those who attended roc it was readily apparent from our announcements and our product demonstrations that may come as well positioned with a portfolio standing high performance analog lasers silicon photonics optical subassemblies and mixing indiscernible across all protocols and form factors were now being sponsored actively pulled by top cloud data center customers to provide various solutions through various customers and channels to fulfill what we expect will be insatiable demand for connectivity for many years to come personally i havent seen such a breakout in our part of the industry since the advent of digital handsets and smartphones decades ago its shaping up yes to be that big having that said at the architectural table with these major cloud customers thanks to the appliedmicro acquisition and having shared our vision for delivering requisite technology and economics we believe macom is well positioned to meet the requisite capacity supply chain flexibility and pace of innovation that carrier centric optical players have not delivered to date it looks like were facing an extremely supply elastic market not price elastic supply elastic unit to man in cloud data centers will outstrip carrier demand by orders of magnitude assuming supply at the right capacity and economics whatever we can produce and for that matter what everyone else in the industry can produce at the right cost will be deployed posttest long term share will be determined by short term operational execution better yet the cloud data center is a north american phenomenon thats governed by moores law and fuels hyper growth and cloud based economies by comparison cyclical carrier budgets invest at a more deliberate pace and are governed by public policy which has proven time and again to be unpredictable a great example today is china for that reason we view cloud data centers as a long term sustainable high value market that we are well positioned to service with high performance analog mixed signal and photonics semiconductors given that this market is currently and perhaps perpetually insatiable in demand for greater bandwidth density weve made the decision to focus operational resources on maximizing may come short term share capture in this market above all else thereby maximizing short medium and long term value to our shareholders operational execution and ramping macom production will be paramount over the coming months in quarters so top down focus and prioritization is key diving deeper into data centers we had another breakout quarter with  yearonyear growth excluding any contribution from appliedmicro including appliedmicro data centers is now  of total revenue its now the single largest endmarket we service and its poised to be our strongest growth driver as well there were three major developments last quarter in the space first our high performance analog products enabled more than  million ports in the first half of this year thats up from  million for all of last year this includes everything from laser and vcsel drivers to cdrs and tias across all standards from as sr psm cwdm and lr servicing all major cloud service providers second we saw a meaningful revenue contribution from  gig lasers into g transceivers given the supply elasticity in this market weve made ramping g laser production our top priority from a factory qualification and operational standpoint the long term economic potential of our etched facet lasers and selfaligned lpic cannot be overestimated short term execution is therefore imperative third indiscernible we showcased production units of our quad lpic for c wdm and  gig pam as well as our full complement of  gig pam products spending five lasers lpic drivers and tias were now working across all customers and channels and delivering these leadership solutions for the major cloud service providers at this juncture visibility is good into short term growth in data centers with strong backlog in order intake which we believe will continue to drive growth for the foreseeable future we will prioritize operational resources on cloud data centers which we expect more than offset any weakness our cyclicality on the carrier side of the business so moving over to those optical businesses pon remained weak during the quarter and market demand in inventory challenges persist as we enter q with poor visibility we remain cautious at our outlook for pon for next quarter our value proposition and market position with edge facet lasers remains intact our goal at this juncture is to sustain unit share and maximize gross margin dollars in percentage until g pon ramps materially which we expect to see in  metrolong haul revenue was up sequentially and up  yearonyear strength in metro and additional share gains in other regions more than offset to decline in china looking back there was clearly an inventory build in the december quarter in anticipation of chinese provincial deployments that have now pushed out we begin to see a correction last quarter which we expect will become more pronounced in the june quarter to close out my comments on our optical and data center businesses last quarter was a great example of the benefits of our diversification strategy and not falling into the trap of servicing the captive needs of one standard one region one part of the network or one transceiver supplier were taking share aggressively and we believe we are uniquely positioned in the highest growth segments of our end markets macom’s ability to deliver its capacity supply chain flexibility and pace of innovation thats necessary at the right cost structure is cementing our preeminent position as the supplier of choice across our target markets now touching briefly on ad and mmics last quarter mmic revenue across all of our end markets was up sequentially and grew  yearonyear we continue to fill a void in the marketplace thats been left those competitors undergo consolidation our ad business in total grew sequentially last quarter and was up  yearonyear while we have healthy nonperishable backlogs to realize our full growth aspirations qualifications of certain hire on space products are taking longer than anticipated again demanding backlog remains very healthy in this business so we expect to fully deliver eps and shareholder value as we anticipated albeit over a slightly longer period with that lets touch on gan were right on schedule and squarely fixated on completing qualifications for mhz and ghz customer programs in the june timeframe again these are mainstream programs in frequency bands servicing the heart of macrocell base station production today last quarter we broaden those engagements and today have line of sight to more than  additional programs from  mhz to  ghz at just our first two lead customers with production scheduled in the december to february timeframe at this juncture our ability for that matter our customer’s ability to execute operationally will determine the magnitude and slope of the gan revenue ramp and major base station customers over the coming quarters and years before i close id like to provide a quick update on the appliedmicro integration were right on track with our  day plan which is going exceptionally well on all fronts including weve retained all key people weve integrated all key business at operational systems and weve consummated macom engagements with all of their top tier customers notably five of the seven major cloud customers we also continue to move the ball forward with our process to divest the compute business and are working to bring it to a timely conclusion ive now had the opportunity to meet personally with appliedmicro’s top customers and i can tell you that the combined macom apm opportunity is more attractive than even we had imagines the opportunities for macsec and pam are not only real but the transaction has elevated macom to strategic status at major accounts for products and opportunities across our entire portfolio to put this transaction in perspective though appliedmicro and pam is the icing on the cake for macom and cloud data centers the breakout i spoke about earlier has been in high performance and of lasers and silicon photonics for standards well before and beyond single lambda pam appliedmicro has accelerated and elevated macom’s relevance and preeminence in everything we do and what could be the most exciting cyclical growth driver in our space for many years to come so wrapping it all up last quarter was yet another testament to our diversified business strategy across several markets and several growth drivers we continue to ride the optical super cycle with our long haul and metro portfolio we continue to lead the technology transition again and at base stations our mmic products continue to fill the void created by industry consolidation and last but not least we are well positioned to service insatiable demand in arguably the biggest secular growth driver of them all connectivity within cloud data centers for these reasons you will understand why we remain bullish on macom’s ability to continue to outperform as we have over the past three years through good times and bad with that lets talk about next quarter guidance for the fiscal third quarter ending june   we expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million adjusted gross margin is expected to be between  and  and adjusted earnings per share between  and  on an anticipated  million fully diluted shares outstanding operator you can now open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of harlan sur of jpmorgan securities llc your line is now open harlan sur good afternoon and thank you for taking my question you delivered gross margins they were good but they were nevertheless in the lower half of your guidance range it seems like given the growth of the different segment it was probably mix related but i wanted to get your views on the profile in march and if you could be just help us understand what are the drivers that are going to take gross margins a  basis points higher in the june quarter steve ferranti harlan thanks for that question there is a mix influences of growth margin we sees the opportunity given the higher margin data center business and the heavy demand in that marketplace that really flush out more of the power pc embedded revenue that was booked on the last time buy when we acquired amcc in that margin brought us slightly down so that has a backlog now that we are still working through towards the end of the year but as that product continues to decline onto the last time buy situation thats how we get the extra  basis points harlan sur  plus steve ferranti  plus harlan sur okay thanks for the color there and then thats a good seg win my next question which is as we think about the june quarter in your revenue guidance at a high level it would seem that the full quarter indiscernible of the amccs business is driving most of the incremental revenue growth because you still had a third of the connectivity and embedded business to recognize which would then imply that core macom is essentially flat sequentially is that the way to think about it if not could you help us understand whats going and whats not in the june quarter thanks john croteau yes so parts of the portfolio they have nothing to do with amcc like amd and multimarket we are actually growing low single digits so thats not entirely accurate including the networks businesses low single digits so i would say the one thing that we want to be very clear about and i think i was emphatic is there is no question that there is a cyclical weakness on the carrierbased side of the business par remains weak visibility is low but you have got the china correction happening with the metrolong haul provincial deployments so there is no question that there is some headwinds in demand at the same time we are more than offsetting those with the cloud growth and great backlog great order intake so its really a mix bag so if we didnt have those headwinds in china i think things would be materially stronger harlan sur okay just my last question as you talk about prioritization of the data center focus maybe john if you help us understand what segments or product areas or manufacturing capacity are you going to take resources from is it going to be your pon business which is obviously kind of weak here maybe over the near term or your metro and long haul business any color would be greatly appreciated john croteau so i don’t think it had any impacts on the metro long haul but one of the bottlenecks we have short term is availability of material potential wafers for laser production and actually our revenue for wafer on the data center product to  gig is higher than that from  gig so its logical in every sense of the words strategically as well as tactically to allocate scale us materials to data centers so there is – its kind of fortuitous frankly that the pon business is soft we are certainly ramping epitaxial supply but frankly that data center demands is way faster and way bigger than we ever anticipated if you asked us probably did ask us  days ago we did not anticipate a turnaround as hard as it is another interesting thing that there is we actually are hiring back all the people that we had like growing africa we have downsized africa to a development fact and we find that we just cant ramp low well fast enough not equipment capacity but product qualifications so we are actually turning africa back on its production fab to service that short term demand i think the other place that we bottlenecked is we have awful lot of qualifications going on right now part of the stuff we talked about pushing out was qualifications on high one space products we have got the gan qualifications we have got  gig laser qualifications we have got the last of the metallic qualifications in lowell and there is just infinite resources to complete all of these new product calls so those are some of the trade offs and again we talked last quarter about sticking on mix and thats what this is all about harlan sur great thank you john croteau you are welcome operator thank you our next question comes from cj muse of evercore your line is now open cj muse yes good afternoon thank you for taking my question i guess first question to revisit in an earlier question can you share with us what amcc contributed revenue wise and here i would love to hear what was put in data center for the core business and where the power pc revenues resided and then how we should think about the incremental growth in business into june steve ferranti see j we dont break out acquisitions after they are embedded but generally to answer the balance of the question the majority of the connectivity business is in our network business some of its in data center some of it is in other nonoptical businesses there is a small insignificant portion thats also classified under the embedded pc business as multimarket john croteau yes thats product in sales and printers clearly not a network application cj muse okay well i guess its maybe to help us model and understand the gross margin driver could you help us understand what came through in low margin in margin how should we think of that falling off in the coming qs steve ferranti so the revenue would probably be about the same for the next couple of quarters its the – thats not the headwind that it is this quarter because the mix of business in the other product areas are stronger for the higher margins so what we setup is to keep it consistent over the balance of the fiscal year for the embedded pc products yet the higher gross margin data center business products mix is going to push the margin higher john croteau yes actually so if i can provide a little more color so there is very healthy growth in the underlying connectivity business quarteronquarter which is the stuff that’s long term preserved that is why we did the acquisition the issue of the embedded power pc business is an issue of how much we want to bleed and how much dilution we can afford on the gross margin line so as we said last quarter and we did last quarter the next quarter to we are going to be stick handling that mix so that we dont dilute things too much but we get that backlog behind us cj muse got you i guess as my followup when you talked earlier about supply elastic market as you service the cloud data center i am curious how do you think about the gross margin profile there today and overtime and as you concentrate your time energy investments on that business does that change the operating profile of the model near term john croteau no if it changed it would actually be accretive data center business today the high performance analog stuff and the laser margins are at the upper end of our portfolio and the reason is there is subtle point here but very important we are talking about we have engineered solutions from the analog specially the lasers and lpic which are really geared for scale capacity and cost structures and lot of that is revolving in lpic capacity technology for the lasers this is the same reason why we could take permanent share in pon arguably the most cost sensitive market competing with localized chinese competitors and have gross margins that are very attractive and very accretive to our corporate average so because we have those things engineered for cost and design for manufacturer we can supply what is shaping up i mean the market for connectivity is  million grown to  million per yearonyear growing projected to be  million a few years out your question is whats the mix of g versus  versus g and my comment about supply elasticity is we are now hitting the cost per bit such that it seems like literally every unit that we can manufacture will actually ship and drive that conversion from  gig or  gig upto  gig in fact we are actively engaged with these customers for  gig so its literally right now an insensible demand but i think one of the strongest element of macom is we engineered the stuff for cost its not repricing or telecom products at low gross margins that’s profound difference great question though cj muse very good thank you john croteau you are welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of blayne curtis of barclays your line is now open blayne curtis hey guys thanks for taking my question maybe just on the optical business john you talked about pon being little bit weaker you would hope that it would bottom just kind of curious your updated thoughts as to is there still inventory and have those other suppliers not backed out and on the flip side you saw strong growth in your data center business i dont believe you are shipping  g lasers yet but you talked about having the fabs ramp back up so can you just talk the timing of bringing  g lasers to revenue john croteau yes  g is in volume its  million of revenue both in the form of lasers and embedded in our optical subassemblies and our tosas so that is in production the task before us is scaling that from low millions to many millions so its and its now you explain to what we did with the pon when we acquired buying optics we had to scale that in capacity to be able to take that share thats exactly what we are facing this year a very much in an analogous task and eminently doable i think i missed the front end of your question blayne curtis just update on the pon market why i think you said specifically with bottom it sound like its getting worse john croteau no its not getting worse just we havent seen clear recovery and it behaves like a commodity market so until the order intake is there and the demand is firm i dont want to be in the business of declaring recovery but yes there is no question the inventories have been burning down where they burn down and how well the market the end market performs is where the ambiguity is so the message i want deliver is we are not planning on some big recovery to be able to achieve our guidance blayne curtis got you and then i just wanted to ask on ad side you had good  yearoveryear growth at one point you are hoping for maybe even better just kind of maybe an update there in terms of some of the trajectory on ad john croteau yes so we are backlogged to be able to achieve what i have previously said which is  yearonyear growth frankly as we face some of these tradeoffs or priorities specifically qualifications for high role space and some of the metallic stuff thats non perishable fungible backlog we can push that out into subsequent quarter or quarters and focus the priorities instead on the  gig lasers where the  gig its the reason why i am emphasizing on the scripted remarks that short term execution is imperative  its going to be determining long term shares so pushing out some what i would call tactically and debacklog thats nonperishable is a very logical thing to do in the concept of stickhandle mix blayne curtis got you and then sorry for the third one but in that stickhandle mix i just want to understand bobs comment you expected this embedded power pc business will shift through the fiscal year or when do you envision the shipment will start robert mcmullan blayne the way the order book is coming and remember we noted in last conference call that there was a last time buy issue here so we have backlog that we can stickhandle that it will proceed to the end of the year and thereafter we dont expect any more business john croteau yes i think the comment last quarter was we are planning to get all of it behind us in this fiscal year so we can exit the year clean this was again this was a surprise to us with the business coming in and we executed last time by before closing and there is nothing we can do about how they manage the business between signing and closing but the quicker we can get through that to be honest the earlier question about gross margin dilution is a bit frustrating for us because the rest of the business is performing quite well in that respect and its just optically blends out our gross margin so its little frustrating blayne curtis thanks guys john croteau yes operator thank you our next question comes from quinn bolton of needham your line is now open quinn bolton hi john and bob congratulations on the nice strength in data center john i just wanted to come back to your comments about the china business you talked about clearly seen in the inventory build in the december quarter and you are kind of working through that in march and i think you said your script that it might get worsen in june and i just wanted to clarify was that comment specifically around china long haul and provincial network build or refrain back to your pon business john croteau no that was specifically the provincial deployments not pon quinn bolton to the gig sorry go ahead john john croteau yes it’s not pon we are not talking about pon getting worse pon is eventually getting better it was specifically we started to see some correction the end of last quarter in the  gig long haul metro stuff specifically in china there would be more pronounced in june quinn bolton okay and this is a sort of a follow up question on that i think you have give the splits for optical at  million and base center  million in the march quarter it sounds like the optical bucket because of that headwinds in china the optical bucket probably down but more than offset by growth in data center is that the right way we would be thinking about in the june quarter john croteau yes i believe thats correct i dont have those numbers in front of me but thats the still positive thats correct quinn bolton second question you talked about again on the silicon going through calls now and i think you said expect first order in the december to february timeframe is that the right timing for us to be thinking about the first production revenue in that december to february timeframe john croteau sorry for the confusion in my scripted remarks so we have the initial programs which would generate revenue as soon we complete the customer calls as planned prior to that but those are just the first two programs one  mhz program and  ghz program what i referred to in december to february was the  additional programs that we have line of at site two where products aligned and were delivering on customer requirements for those programs my comment was weve got to get through the gates of these first program call before we can secure a business on the subsequent ones so it would begin to ramp earlier than that but when you talk about really building material revenue you got to get beyond the first two programs and thats december to february quinn bolton got it and then last for you just on the  gig laser business obviously a lot of data come module venders have internal laser production but i think there are number of players in the optical margin space especially in the asia that they don’t have internal laser production so i was just wondering if you can comment or do you see in demand from both sort of the captive marginal houses that have internal laser productions for your first shipments to some of the folks that don’t have internal laser production john croteau so its both were obviously very sensitive to not be disclosing people who also have internal supply but the reality is and i think over time itll become more obvious our etched facet technology is singularly and uniquely geared for the capacity supply chain flexibility and cost structure for data centers taking nothing away from the laser capability our cost structure is something that we can thrive in a market like pon with a value proposition closer to  gig to  gip level so i think even those people with their own captive laser supply recognize that and will be a transit i would expect a transition but theyd be inappropriate for us to comment further about those customers and their decisions quinn bolton thank you john john croteau you are welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tore svanberg of stifel your line is now open tore svanberg yes thank you first question is on data center so if you just look at your portfolio now john with the ip portfolio i think you mention in your presentation that you want to be number one in five for data center can you talk us where you stand there and is there anything else you need to investment at this point to kind of become number one in five john croteau no i think were complete to be clear were already number one in the analog content laser drivers cdr and so on i think based upon my comments i just made on the  gig lasers i think were destined pretty quickly to be number one is a millions of units nice hundreds of thousands to put in context the hundred gig long haul metro data center market even though its growing  compound growth this year and next year its still only  growing to  units were talking about tens of millions of units two orders of magnitude higher for these lasers so well get that economic advantage its then palate into the opex which is the silicon photonics with the foot chip laser so and the economics of that start attacking manufacturing costs so we have that for both cwd and m so well before you need m ne and then you get the icing on the cake as i described it which is the pam single lam  gig but also the quad  gig pam and a zero ambiguity with the solution is for  gigs and by the way the real subtlety is with the tosarosa capability that we picked up aside us we are not delivering spot components were providing components at a fully validated to people who can wrap those things and mass volume so i would challenge people to find someone else with anything close to that portfolio and capability tore svanberg thats really helpful and moving into to china would you be able to share with us what percentage of macom’s business is in china for the optical and do you have any visibility at all sort of beyond the june quarter because obviously we heard a lot about the near term weakness but there are some suggestions and maybe second half is going to come back so do you have any visibility at all beyond the june quarter john croteau yes there are two areas of weakness of pon and theres that inventory correction the overall market is not that ugly its modestly down for two and a half gig now  gig is ramping but its just not material in  compared two and half gig and it is going to be growth driver for  weve got a great position there but thats future but for pon its inventory situation that was built up with these local chinese competitors that are now out of business so that will covered just as the inventory drains the real salient issue of these provincial deployments i mean looking back to september and especially december quarters were like  to  year on year growth in a market thats growing  some would say  port growth still a max i mean those inventory builds and that’s what started correcting and i think june is the bottom of that and if the provincial deployments move forward as expected i think the back half of the year should be a strong recovery tore svanberg very good thank you and just one last question on gan so you mentioned that the two initial deployments and then  other engagements and december to february timeframe contribution potential from those were you referring to revenue contribution for those  or with that more going to be the timeframe when the calls would be completed with those  john croteau so the call issue is much more of the first customer qualifications of programs where they qualify not just again technology but the products in the in entirety designs and the whole thing once we get past that gate we will be able to proliferate into these additional programs through the gate and we have line of site again we have teams that have been servicing these base station guys for decades literally so weve got access weve got all the required customers we have opened up all the requirements were delivering on those requirements as the giant gate to get through these first calls the second designs the second wave there that  that i referred to becomes infinitely easier once you get past that that initial gate tore svanberg thats really helpful thank you john john croteau you are welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes out mark delaney of goldman sachs your line is now open mark delaney good afternoon thanks very much for taking the questions my first question is help me to get up with better understand of the new step segment classifications within networks so i think you said  points fixed for data center can you help us understand how much of that is tied to the hyperscale cloud customers or is any of that on promised at the data centers john croteau that revenue set includes the revenue on the ot indiscernible and it applied micro as well right robert mcmullan traditional standing data centers versus cloud john croteau yes i have to apologize i dont have off the top of my head the legate but i would call the legacy otm indiscernible revenue is coming in from appliedmicro but a big chunk of that right now is the analog content go into the cloud guys and a very healthy contribution from the  gig laser those in the form of standalone and tosa’s so its really a combination of so i apologize i just dont have the numbers in front of me to just slip the two mark delaney okay i understand that was the optical piece which i think was  million this quarter in the december quarter it was  million that decline for  to  was any of that because of this new creation of the data center category so we have got apples to apples the december quarter number would have been lower in optical or is that the in apples to apples decline with an optical john croteau it was not apples to apples the previous number we quoted included data centers and what we said starting this quarter we would separate the two provide greater transparency net pulling out data centers apples to apples we are actually up mark delaney okay and then i just trying to understand a little bit more on the provincial decline of the company seen in china i think the last quarter the commentary was the only issue the company was seen was in was in pon as i recall and it spread and i know the forecast is very difficult we just can’t at the start of the business but may be you can help us understand a bit more about what was surprising to you guys what had you been expecting what your customers and have been telling you and why did that not materialize as you had been anticipating  days ago john croteau specifically in the pon or… mark delaney the provincial metro which is now weaker than i think the company had expected  days ago john croteau yes i think what we knew that during the exuberance of the september and december quarters when we go back we were trying to provide some cautionary stuff about diversification as there was clearly an inventory build the market was not growing at  to  year on year so that is not a surprise i think some of the timing of the provincial deployments pushing out and some of the behavior of the customers very recently in recent weeks thats a little bit of a surprise and thats whats behind my comment about things being a little more pronounced in the june quarter but until the provincial deployments start moving forward were going to be dealing with customers who are kind of locked up rob mcmullan yes mark long haul metro on a apples to apples basis did grow this quarter so we have had substantial growth than prior quarters it just didn’t live up to that past growth expectations john croteau mark what i was just looking through the spreadsheet i have in front of me here it looks like the legacy part of the appliedmicro portfolio is about  of that of total so about  of our total would be legacy on a price mark delaney that’s very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of harsh kumar of stephens your line is now open harsh kumar hey guys i was wondering if you could john or bob give us a sense of how big pon and maybe metro was in this quarter for you you gave us a good data on date centers so i was wondering get the other part robert mcmullan so pon is probably at its low level is under  down from few points under  of where it was in q and the second part of the question was metro same thing but we dont break out metro… john croteau actually metro long haul was up so at the beginning of the correction in china but our share gains outside of china actually more than offset whats going on in china harsh kumar okay but i was wondering if i get a percentage so we can get a good idea like how the optical piece is made up of robert mcmullan it’s not in hand though harsh kumar i can get it later bob would you say that maybe i think in some of the earlier calls you would have said that may be you are expecting some initial revenues and indiscernible this particular quarter at least the first part of the ramp i know you said that thats coming later and then theres an additional piece coming in december and february is there a reason why its getting pushed out and just kind of the standard stuff that happens or just early sort of qualifications stuff john croteau well certainly in the last ninety days i apologize if i misscommunicated  days ago but very consistent that the qualifications for these initial customer programs are early june that were still on track with those dates so if i created a different perception i apologize but i mean there are certainly delayed from what we had hoped a year or two ago and its just a long arduous process of getting locked down on these programs and completing all the intensive qualification issues and to put a little color on that you got to realize for base stations youre talking about a product that spends decades in the field so reliability and qualifications are much bigger deals than for instance a consumer product than a handset but those schedules have been locked for over  days now harsh kumar i got you thanks and for the last one i know there was a compute piece that was up for sale and i know youre working on your day plan do you john and bob feel reasonably comfortable about the potential for maybe possibly selling that business john croteau yes selling the issue is to whom with what structure transaction right we are really stuck that we really cant make public comments at this time because we have got a process going and telegraphing the type of interest and who and at what valuation would be so in inappropriate but we have had our heads down working that process from the day it closed we are right on track from the schedules that were locked down there we just reviewed options with our board and now we are moving to the next phase the next round and those who are still in the process are being informed harsh kumar got it thanks guys robert mcmullan i have your answer so long haul optical data center interconnect this quarter was  compared to  last quarter harsh kumar awesome thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of richard shannon of craighallum your line is now open richard shannon hi john and bob thank you for taking my questions as well i guess a few from me i will start in the data center space for the june quarter john are you expecting material growth in lpec or is that coming after june john croteau so it will be after june so we have production units and we are completing the designs i think in the december quarter where we would start seeing the first volume production but we have the production devices completing qualification qualification is not a big issue as it is with gan both the customer designs and ramping into production is just the phase that we are in right now richard shannon okay and when you talk about imperative in the shortterm to execute on the data center side is that specific to lpec or more broadly across data center customers and curious why that is the case is there some specific window you are trying to hit here or are you just shifting your strategic focus to that area john croteau we are absolutely shifting strategic focus i mean let me give you the context and you can do the math so in the long haul metro market which is fantastic it is growing  compound growth from around   units in ’ up to around  on the path towards close to  over a twoyear period it is great and wonderful to put it in context the unit portsmarket the number of ports in data centers is  million going to  million going to  million that is the tam currently it is g and we are converting g and g up to g so if you do the math on the content and it is a multibilliondollar opportunity for us it is analogous to the magnitude of handsets and smart phones in the compound semispace it is a big opportunity we are very well positioned and the first thing that comes to mind it is execution on everything including by the way the pam platform that appliedmicro comes in with but the first thing that is paramount is ramping  gig laser production it is in production there was very material multiple millions of dollars of revenue in  gig lasers enabled revenue in tosas but ramping to the tens of millions of units as we did for pon i mean we are shipping at peak  million to  million units per month of g pon we need to do the same thing with  gig and we are right on track to do that it is right within our wheelhouse it is just there is a lot of execution to be able to ramp that and get the yields up to where they need to be to be able to deliver – when we do that we uniquely have the capacity supplychain flexibility and we play a very strategic focus role in the industry for those cloud data center guys the optical industry is not geared to supply that magnitude of units that magnitude of ports we have the hpa business the previous mindspeed business in newport beach that has done that they are in a lead position in the industry as we rollout the lasers and lay out the lasers literally on top of the lpecs that is when we stand alone and then the pam stuff let us in there is just a lot of operational execution to be able to ramp from what we have done today with analog which is  million units in the first half of the year to s of millions of units across these products there is a lot of execution but if you do the math you will see the reason why it is unquestionably it dwarfs all else that we do richard shannon okay i appreciate that perspective john that makes a lot of sense last quick question from me you talked about within the optical carrier business some share gains in china offsetting a little bit of weakness there can you characterize where those share gains are coming from john croteau actually the share gain is outside of china richard shannon outside of china okay john croteau yes and it is north america and japan where we – from day one we have had a very strong position with certain japanese customers and there is an insatiable demand that they have servicing metro and dci this is dci data center interconnect not within data centers but still coherent but i mean we are supply constrained in that space as bizarre as it sounds because some of the product is different than that from china richard shannon got it okay great thats all that questions from me guys thank you john croteau youre welcome operator thank you that is all the time we have for questions today let me hand the call back over to mr croteau for any closing remarks a  john croteau very good so before closing out today’s call i want to
