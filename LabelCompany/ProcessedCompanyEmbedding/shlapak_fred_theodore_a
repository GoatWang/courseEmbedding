of motorolas sps to retirefred shlapak president of motorolas sps to retire david lammers  pm edt post a comment no ratingslogin to rate tweet austin texas  fred shlapak who came in as president of motorolas semiconductor products sector sps just as the industrys worst downturn was about to begin will retire soon motorola chairman chris galvin sent a memo to employees tuesday june rd saying that shlapak had told galvin of an intention to retire by his th birthday which comes in october shlapak was named sps president at an inauspicious time september of  just when early signs appeared that what was to become the industrys most severe downturn ever was about to begin faced with a revenue decline from more than  billion in  to slightly less than  billion in  and again last year shlapak has managed what one employee described as an organized retreat laying off some  sps employees cutting capital investments sharply while forging a process development alliance with philips semiconductors and stmicroelectronics and signing a strategic partnership with foundry tsmc while paring motorolas own manufacturing operations from  to  longtime motorola spokesman ken phillips who is retiring himself next month after more than two decades at sps said that will be freds legacy that he took this place through a total makeover it doesnt get much tougher than the job fred had to do and he did it with great fortitude shlapak joined motorola in  as an applications engineer in canada and spent much of his career managing motorolas semiconductor operations in europe however good motorolas defense has been in terms of forging new partnerships and cutting costs shlapaks critics within motorola have argued that he failed to engineer a potent offense in terms of new product initiatives for example motorola has largely sat on the sidelines despite its heritage in both wireless and networking as wireless lan technology has become the single most exciting new opportunity in the electronics industry one source who asked not to be identified said morale within sps remains fairly low even as the big layoffs have subsided the emphasis on cutting costs has not been matched with innovative strategies to position motorola in growth areas he said they talk about the number of new products but they are nearly all incremental improvements motorola needs to do something new you cant just keep cutting costs and expect to get to profitability you have to spend on the new things he said galvins memo said that even though  has started off slowly for sps we strongly believe that silicon and software provide a core offering for our customers i support your plan to introduce  new products this year up from  last year and about  in  the senior leadership team continues to value your contribution as motorolans and is committed to the success of this business motorola is participating in exciting developments within the automotive electronics field seeing the fruits of efforts within sps over the past decade spokesman phillips said and shlapak is proud of a new product line of electronic switches that may replace conventional switches and relays bill walker the secondranked executive within sps will not seek to replace shlapak among the internal candidates are scott anderson who runs the automotive and standard products group which includes microcontrollers chris belden vice president of technology and manufacturing ray burgess the vice president of marketing and strategy who earlier ran the digital consumer operation and david perkins who heads up the networking and computer systems group franz fink a native of germany who has held a variety of jobs within sps recently was named vice president of the wireless and broadband systems group fink replaces peter shinyeda who has yet to be reassigned to a new job within motorola phillips said email thisprintcomment comments view comments newest first  oldest first  threaded view close this box
