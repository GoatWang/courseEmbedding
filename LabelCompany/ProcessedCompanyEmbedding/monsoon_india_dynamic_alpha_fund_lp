monsoon india dynamic alpha fund midas on november   both the delaware limited partnership for us taxable investors and the offshore fund for nonus investors and taxexempts are now open for monthly subscriptions we are offering discounted fees for early investors monsoon capital is a  million alternatives manager focused on india we have over  years of experience investing in the indian capital markets with a  person team based in mumbai and washington dc we believe that india provides attractive investment opportunities as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world said gautam prakash he added having invested in india through multiple market cycles we developed the midas strategy by combining a fundamental longonly stock selection process with an active dynamic hedging model to manage both equity market and currency risks so in rising markets midas will tend to have high net exposures  to  net long while in falling markets midas will tend to have low net exposures  to  net long all the while maintaining a longterm portfolio of high quality high growth stocks similarly when the rupee is depreciating midas will typically be currency hedged whereas when the rupee is appreciating midas will typicall be unhedged on the currency this dynamic approach enables midas to generate attractive gains in bull markets while controlling losses in bear markets article link

returns and its expected performance given its level of risk as measured by beta a positive alpha figure indicates the fund has performed better than its beta would predict in contrast a negative alpha indicates the funds underperformance given the expectations established by the funds beta all mpt statistics alpha beta and rsquared are based on a leastsquares regression of the funds return over treasury bills called excess return and the excess returns of the funds benchmark index alpha can be used to directly measure the value added or subtracted by a funds manager alpha depends on two factors  the assumption that market risk as measured by beta is the only risk measure necessary   the strength of the linear relationship between the fund and the index as it has been measured by rsquared in addition a negative alpha can sometimes result from the expenses that are present in a funds returns but not in the returns of the comparison index example a fund has an alpha of  a beta of  and an rsquared of  the high rsquared lends further credibility to the accuracy of the funds alpha and beta the alpha of  indicates that the fund produced a return  higher than its beta would
