the objective is to additional gains to fund an enhanced lifestyle and keep up with inflation sequencing of returns – the biggest risk in retirement are your retirement savings at too much risk  there are so many good aggressive strategies to use for investing while you are still accumulating assets and saving in your k or ira’s  but as this life savings gets closer to becoming your main source of

plan principal preservation life insurance and annuities insuring your plan can play a vital part in protecting your loved ones two very effective ways of doing this are by using life insurance and annuities life insurance is traditionally thought of as providing money for your survivors when you die but it can also be a very flexible tool that could be part of almost any financial plan it can also provide taxfree income during your retirement it can protect your business your assets and estate it can provide you with long term care insurance it bypasses probate thus providing your family with an immediate source of cash after you are gone   annuities can play an important role in your financial plan especially for your retirement they can be used to give you a steady stream of income throughout your retirement but caution needs to be taken when deciding which of the vast array of products available you should use  some will have unnecessary fees and there are subtle differences between contracts that can make a big difference to you it can pay an income for life no matter how long you live – pension replacement it can be used as a protected investment choice with returns similar to bonds it can grow at significant interest rates for either future income or death benefit it can be added to the plan to protect a survivors income after a spouse passes   we at waterstone
