his three friends were among the young jewish nobility to be taken into captivity in babylon daniel had committed his life to the god of abraham isaac and jacob so when offered the king’s food which had been dedicated to babylonian gods and not prepared under strict jewish standards daniel refused to eat it instead he asked that he and his hebrew companions be fed only pulse food grown from seed and drink only water the steward in charge of their care reluctantly agreed to allow this change for  days and then test the health of the four young men after the  days the hebrew men were found to be in far superior health and intellectual acuteness than the other slaves who ate the king’s food read the full account at wwwdanielfastcom the men went on to lead lives of the highest integrity with unwavering trust in their god they were promoted to high rankings in the government overcame many challenges and served as impeccable models for the life people can have when they submit their will to the will of the most high god today hundreds of christians throughout the world use the daniel fast as a method for spiritual fasting the fast is modeled after the fasting experiences of the prophet as recorded in daniel  and daniel  along with typical jewish fasting principles to learn more about this type of fasting visit the daniel fast website at wwwdanielfastcom even more tidbits of history some of the earliest archeological dating goes back  years to caves discovered in greece they have been an important staple over the centuries and were mentioned in the bible in genesis  in this story esau gave up his birth right for a bowl of lentils the danielfast explained prove thy servants i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink daniel  in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled daniel  the daniel fast is a partial fast practiced by millions of christians around the world the definition of a biblical fast is to restrict some or all food for a spiritual purpose the daniel fast is modeled after the fasting experiences of the hebrew prophet when he and his companions were in captivity in babylon not wanting to defile his body by eating the king’s food daniel asked to be fed only pulse food grown from seed and drink only water daniel wrote of another of his fasts in which he ate no pleasant bread leavened drank no wine and ate no meat with these guidelines the daniel fast eating plan can be described as a vegan diet with more restrictions men women and teens who enter a period of prayer and fasting using the daniel fast experience answers to prayers a more intimate relationship with god

among the young jewish nobility to be taken into captivity in babylon daniel had committed his life to the god of abraham isaac and jacob so when offered the king’s food which had been dedicated to babylonian gods and not prepared under strict jewish standards daniel refused to eat it instead he asked that he and his hebrew companions be fed only pulse food grown from seed and drink only water the steward in charge of their care reluctantly agreed to allow this change for  days and then test the health of the four young men after the  days the hebrew men were found to be in far superior health and intellectual acuteness than the other slaves who ate the king’s food read the full account at wwwdanielfastcom the men went on to lead lives of the highest integrity with unwavering trust

fast guidelinesdisclaimer i came across a few variations of the daniel fast while searching on the net some people such as myself eat whole wheat pasta but others may prefer to just eat vegetables and little of anything else don’t be legalistic about it just pray and do it with a good attitude without judging others regardless of how you choose to do the daniel fast overall you are going to make a sacrifice by practically becoming a vegetarian for  days the daniel fast is in fact more strict than a vegetarian diet because you can’t have any sugar coffee refined grains fried foods or dairy products foods that are allowed organic whole grains brown rice wild rice oats barley spelt whole wheat buckwheat corn millet farro bulgur etcwhat are whole grainswhole grains are basically grains that have not been refined and therefore still contain bran and germ   for instance brown rice pop corn and oats are whole grains on the other hand white rice  is not a whole grain because it is milled so the bran and germ is actually removed refined grains do not sprout but whole grains do whole grains contain almost  times more dietary fiber than refined grains source wikipediabread ezequiel genesis  and mana breads which are all made with sprouted whole grains and some types are made without yeast there are also some generic brands out there that you can try you can eat other unleaved breads no yeast like wholewheat  or corn tortillas pita plus other types of wholegrain flat breads avoid multigrain bread which only contains some whole grains but it’s not  whole grain and probably fluffier we have to avoid such delicacies organic legumes beans all kinds lentils peas chickpeas  legumes are an excellent source of proteinorganic fruits all kinds of fresh or frozen organic fruit avoid canned and dried fruit which are both packed with added sugar dried fruit with no added sugar is ok if you are not diabetic bananas and other fruits with a high glycemic index may not be ok if you are diabetic check with your doctor or nutritionistorganic vegetables all kinds of fresh or frozen organic vegetables you can also try organic veggie burgers make sure they are vegan because

is based upon the prophet daniel’s experiences as recorded in the bible  scripture gives us some insight such as in dan  into what he ate and didn’t eat however we don’t know his complete menu what we do know is this in daniel  daniel chose not to eat the royal food that he was being served and ate only vegetables and drank water another time in daniel  he deprived himself of choice food meat and wine as he sought the lord in prayer most commentaries believe “choice food” would have been bread and sweets this is why i believe you will find some variation in the specific guidelines for the modernday daniel fast as far as what foods are included and which ones are restricted the food guidelines on my website are the ones most commonly observed in a daniel fast the intention of today’s daniel fast is not to duplicate exactly what daniel did but the spirit in which he did it daniel’s passion for the lord caused him to hunger and thirst more for spiritual food than for physical food which should be the desire of anyone choosing to participate in this type of fast try not to get too hung up on what you should and shouldn’t eat the most important part of the daniel fast is that you deny yourself physically so that you may seek the lord in prayer and grow closer to him your fast may look a little different than someone else’s and that’s fine some people may need to be stricter than others in their food choices so that their fast is a sacrifice for them these food guidelines are meant to be just that – a guide they are given to help you create boundaries for your fast the
