the fund is run by a tenured management team is overseen by an established parent company and charges one of the lowest expense ratios of the leveraged municipal fund peer group however the fund has struggled to translate these positive characteristics into aboveaverage performance and has typically lagged its peer group on both an absolute and volatilityadjusted basis despite the subpar performance the funds positive characteristics have earned it a morningstar analyst rating of bronzeformerly an insured muni fund iim dropped its insurance mandate and merged with two similar funds in  as a result the current portfolio has a higher quality tilt than some of invescos other leveraged municipal cefs roughly  of assets are rated a or above and  are rated bbb rather than take on credit risk the portfolio generates high income by situating its assets primarily on the longer end of the yield curve with a weighted average maturity of  years the portfolio also had an effective duration of  years indicating a high sensitivity to changes in interest rates although  of assets will become callable over the next five years this is somewhat low for the peer group the management team was appointed to this fund in  with invescos acquisition of van kampen though it remained intact throughout the transition and the three head managers have worked together since  in all the investmentgrade municipal team includes a quantitative portfolio analyst two traders and seven credit analysts we like that robert wimmel has about  years of portfolio management experience while other members of the team tout an average  years of investment experience although this portfolio invests principally in investmentgrade credit the managers also draw on the research of a separate highyield municipal team morningstar has assigned invesco a positive parent ratingdespite these positive characteristics overall performance has been lackluster since the current management team took

volatilityadjusted performance also has been below average over these periodsfor the fiscal year ending february  the fund charged an adjusted expense ratio of  which was far below average for leveraged national municipal funds even after adding the cost of leverage the total expense ratio of  was among the lowest of the peer group investors should note that the fund redeemed its auctionrate preferred shares in favor of a more expensive form of leverage financing three months into the reporting period so the future expense ratio could be slightly higherback to top portfolio process approachformerly an insured muni fund iim dropped its insurance mandate and merged with two similar funds in  as a result the current portfolio has a higher quality tilt than some of invesco’s other leveraged municipal cefs invescos municipal team is composed of two sleeves one focuses on investmentgrade bonds and one on highyield bonds this portfolio is managed by the former but it can draw on the research of the latter the investmentgrade sleeve includes six credit analysts two traders a quantitative portfolio analyst and four portfolio managers each sector is covered by a primary analyst and two secondary analysts analysts assign internal credit ratings to each security along with a credit outlook which managers view alongside ratings from major rating organizations highyield analysts conduct site interviews which is especially important for securities without a rating from a major rating organization analysts are in charge of keeping an eye on securities held in the portfolio managers use the internal credit ratings to determine whether specific bonds are fairly valued and generally give an overweighting to sectors where they see more value though the portfolio has exposure limits on credit ratings and sector interestrate exposure is determined in relation to an internal benchmark which is based on peers interestrate exposure managers sometimes use derivatives to tweak interestrate exposure if it strays too far from the benchmarkback to top portfolio positioningthe fund generally focuses on longer duration higherquality municipal bonds as of april   of assets were rated a or above while  were rated bbb geographically the portfolio had its highest exposure to california  texas  florida  and illinois  seventysix percent of assets were invested in revenue bonds with top sectors including hospitals  and public power  the remaining portion of the portfolio was comprised mainly of local general obligation  and prerefunded  debtbonds were generally positioned on the longer end of the yield curve giving the portfolio a weighted average maturity of  years this translated to an effective duration of  years indicating a relatively high sensitivity to changes in interest rates call exposure was moderate with  of assets becoming callable in the next three years and  over the next five yearsthe portfolio had minuscule exposure to the alternative minimum taxback to top distributionsiim has paid a monthly distribution of  per share since  however invesco estimates that the fund under earned its distribution by roughly  in fiscal  nevertheless many similar cefs are underearning their distributions by a wider margin considering that the fund still has  per share in undistributed net investment income the fund may continue to overdistribute until this balance is depletedthe fund offers a standard dividend reinvestment plan in which shares are purchased at market price if they are trading at a discount if shares are trading at a premium the fund will issues new shares at the greater of net asset value or  of the thencurrent share price back to top discountafter a recent selloff across longduration municipal cefs shares of iim are currently trading at an  discount well below its threeyear average discount of  while underearning its distribution and having a portfolio with high interestrate sensitivity might warrant a small discount the current discount is somewhat wide in our opinion over the last three years shares traded between a  premium and an  discount back to top nav performance analysistotal return performance has been lackluster overall over trailing one three and fiveyear periods the fund logged annualized total returns of   and  in comparison the peer group returned an average   and  over the same period since the current management team took over this portfolio the fund has underperformed in four of the last five years while performance has generally been less volatile than average volatilityadjusted returns were still below average the fund logged morningstar riskadjusted returns of  and  over trailing three and fiveyear periods while the peer group returned an average  and back to top risk  returnwhile the fund pays an aboveaverage distribution rate total return performance has typically has been lower and more volatile than many of its peers looking forward interestrate risk is a concern the funds year duration while not unusual for a leveraged municipal fund indicates that the portfolio is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates should the longer end of the yield curve rise the portfolio would likely suffer capital losses back to top feesfor the fiscal year ending february  the fund charged an adjusted expense ratio of  which was far below average for leveraged national municipal funds even after adding in the cost of leverage the total expense ratio of  was among the lowest of the peer group investors should note that the fund redeemed its auctionrate preferred shares in favor of a more expensive form of leverage financing three months into the reporting period so the future expense ratio could be slightly higherthe fund pays a  management fee on the funds total daily assets we do not like that this metric includes the proceeds from leverage this gives managers an incentive to take on extra leverage for the sake of generating higher feesback to top leveragein  the fund redeemed its auctionrate preferred shares in favor of variablerate munifund term preferred shares vmtps in addition the fund uses tender option bonds tobs to create additional leverage after the funds recent merger it has  million in outstanding vmtps and  million in tobs the vmtps are set to expire in june  considering that the interest rates paid on these forms of leverage financing are often more expensive than arps the fund is now paying more for its leverage financing because both forms of leverage are varyingrate an increase in interest rates would further increase the costs of leveragein all this gives the fund a leverage ratio total assetsnet assets of  which is slightly belowaverage for leveraged municipal fundsback to top peoplethe portfolio is managed by invescos investmentgrade municipal team which is headed by robert wimmel the team also includes comanagers robert stryker and thomas byron a quantitative portfolio analyst two traders and seven credit analysts the team works closely with the highyield municipal team which has seven credit analysts and is headed by two portfolio managers on average staff members have about  years of industry experience we like that the team remained intact after invescos acquisition of van kampen although the team only took over management of this portfolio in  the three managers have worked together since the investmentgrade team runs about  billion while we are disappointed that none of the managers owns shares of this fund they each own between  and  in shares of the invesco municipal fund complex managers are paid a base salary and a discretionary bonus which considers one three and fiveyear performance against their funds respective peer groupsback to top parentinvesco has meaningfully improved its stewardship profile notably the firms fund lineup is more sensible in the wake of its  acquisition of van kampens funds among other changes van kampens jim gilligan replaced invescos us value equity cio brent stanley and the combined lineup of funds was reduced by half mainly via merging overlapping strategies funds with lower fees and the better management team survived and changes to the fund offerings are still under way the firm just clears the threshold to earn a positive parent rating under morningstars methodology while fees are reasonable overall they could be lower and managers investments in their own funds shares often fall short of the industrys bestpractices level some areas of weakness remain especially among the taxable fixedincome funds the firm will need to demonstrate that its cultural improvements are sticking and result in tangible longterm benefits for fund shareholdersback to top board of directorsthe member board of directors includes two interested directors colin meadows and wayne whalen meadows is chief administrative office of invesco and joined the board in  after invescos acquisition of van kampen and whalen is a partner in a law firm that provides legal counsel to invesco five directors have served on numerous boards since  previously van kampen funds each board member serves on other boards both inside and outside the complex four members sit on more than  boards within the fund complexboard member terms are staggered and each member is up for reelection every three years while we like periodic elections the staggered board can lead to director entrenchmentduring the latest fiscal year each director was paid about  to serve on all of invescos boards which is in line with average payments to
