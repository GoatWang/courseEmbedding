wiresurge components inc “surge” or the “company” otc pinksprs a leading supplier of capacitors discrete semiconductors and audiblesounding devices announced today that its board of directors has postponed the company’s annual meeting of shareholders to january  the board issued the following statement in conjunction with this announcement“we have decided to postpone the annual meeting in order to ensure all surge shareholders are given sufficient time to make an informed decision about their votes recently dissident shareholders michael tofias and bradley rexroad brought a lawsuit against surge in nevada urging the company to delay the date of the annual meeting and turn over shareholder informationwe were surprised by the demand to delay the annual meeting given that the meeting date was validly set by the company and the dissidents never made this demand previously also under the clear and unambiguous language of the relevant statute the dissidents are not entitled to the requested shareholder information however our commitment to shareholder democracy and transparency remains steadfast and this lawsuit is a time consuming distraction from the important issues at hand and is wasting the company’s and shareholders’ resources therefore we have shared the shareholder information with messrs tofias and rexroad even though we have no obligation under the statute to do so and decided to consent to their demand to delay the annual meeting datewe continue to firmly believe that electing messrs tofias and rexroad to the board of surge and immediately pursuing a sale process is not in the best interests of the company and all shareholders we remind shareholders that tofias and rexroad have not put forth a plan for growing surge and delivering increased shareholder value beyond simply displacing your experienced cofounders – ira levy and steve lubman – from the board and urging a prompt sale of the company these “plans” would leave the company and its shareholders without a clear direction would only serve to satisfy the shortterm interests of these dissident shareholders and would rob you of longterm value creationwe therefore urge all shareholders to support our nominations of ira levy and steve lubman who each has  years of experience in the electronics components industry who together have built the company into what it is today and who are deploying a successful strategy to deliver enhanced longterm value to all shareholders vote today on the gold proxy card to pave the way for continued growth and value creation at

perfect sense 😂😂join the conversation  k surge components inc sends letter to shareholders  business wire surge components inc sends letter to shareholders your experienced cofounders – ira levy and steve lubman – are executing on a successful strategy to drive continued growth at surge dissident shareholders tofias and rexroad have no plan other than to sell the company quickly depriving you of longterm value vote today on the gold proxy card to protect your investment november    am eastern standard time deer park nybusiness wirethe board of directors of surge components inc “surge” or the “company” otc pinksprs a leading supplier of capacitors discrete semiconductors and audible and sounding devices today sent the following letter to surge shareholders  november   dear fellow shareholders at the upcoming surge annual meeting of shareholders to be held on november   we believe you will face a clear choice between  supporting your company’s cofounders ira levy and steve lubman as they continue to execute on a successful strategy to drive continued growth at surge and deliver sustainable longterm value for you this successful strategy has delivered strong growth and profitability over the past eight years since  and we expect more growth this past third quarter alone we delivered a  yearoveryear increase in gross profits and a  gross profit margin or  backing dissident shareholders michael tofias and bradley rexroad whose only stated plan is to quickly sell the company so that they can exit their positions while leaving your money on the table in their own words from their october   letter “we continue to believe surge should be sold preferably to a strategic buyer” now in the th hour they claim to want to “fix” surge but they still offer no plan whatsoever rexroad and tofias do not want to manage or “fix” surge they want to sell it the reality remains that their election would serve their own shortterm interests while leaving you – our shareholders – with a rudderless company your founders clear growth strategy higher margin business expanding international footprint capitalizing on industry relationships each has more than  years of industry experience and strong reputations building longterm value – delivered strong growth and profitability over the past eight years since  the dissidents no plan no industry experience no public board experience flipflopping – quick sale of the company to fix surge grasping at straws – citing  year old ancient history to make their case we urge you to support the reelection of ira levy and steve lubman as directors at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on november   and we recommend that you disregard incorrect and misleading claims made by dissident shareholders tofias and rexroad let’s look at the facts when comparing your company’s founders and the dissidents your founders each possesses more than  years of deep experience in the electronic components industry together they have built surge since its inception in  and as surge’s largest stockholders their interests are aligned with yours cofounders ira levy and steve lubman have worked hard to build surge over the past  years into the successful and growing worldclass business that it is today ira and steve are highlyrespected in the electronic components industry and have the deep customer and supplier relationships that are the lifeblood of the company’s current and future success under their leadership surge’s share price has appreciated tremendously – by  – over the past eight years as owners of approximately  of surge’s stock ira and steve have true “skin in the game” and have the same incentive for the longterm performance of surge as you the dissidents tofias and rexroad have no relevant industry experience and no plan for surge the dissidents are not experts in the electronic components industry and do not understand the complexity of the business they have not presented a strategic plan beyond selling the company which they have stated multiple times as their goal the idea in their most recent letter that they have “no preconceived notions about the ‘right’ future direction for surge” directly contradicts their previous statements tofias and rexroad have never served on the board of a public company your founders have methodically positioned surge for future growth and maximum value creation our plan is working now is not the time to sell over nearly four decades your founders have solidified a robust customer base including fortune  technology companies while further focusing sales efforts on higher margin customers to maximize profitability established a worldclass supply chain with very strong relationships and an international footprint that continues to grow built a strong balance sheet with cash on hand of  million and zero debt positioning the company to take valuecreating actions such as the current  stock buyback and investing in future growth including increasingly focusing our sales efforts on higher margin customers continued hiring of top industry talent potential acquisitions to build the business the dissidents want to cut off surge’s momentum for their own shortterm interests they have made clear they want the company to be sold as quickly as possible so that they can exit their positions selling the company would rob other shareholders of the potential to reap the rewards of our growth strategy they claim that “things are not improving at surge” which we believe to be clearly untrue evidence for the positive momentum at surge includes strong q financial results an increasing focus on highmargin business and a growing international footprint demonstrated by the valuable relationships built by ira and steve despite their lack of any relevant experience they want to replace your founders and industry experts ira levy and steve lubman who are successfully driving a plan to deliver longterm value to shareholders they criticize surge for offering to buy their shares which we believe is an attempt to draw attention away from the main point we tried numerous times to find an amicable resolution with the dissidents and stop this costly proxy contest but they insisted on a “prompt” sale of the entire company your founders have made a point of building strong corporate governance practices at surge surge’s directors have been stewards of shareholder value while adhering to strong corporate governance principles a nationallyrecognized executive compensation firm recently determined that surge’s executive compensation is fully inline with similar companies and that stock and options grants are similarly inline with peer companies recentlyappointed director martin novick is an industry expert with nearly  years of experience the dissidents are selectively highlighting in their campaign aspects of the company’s performance and corporate governance in a misleading effort to paint a picture of poor business performance that is simply untrue their complaint that we did not allow them to communicate with the shareholders is false in fact tofias and rexroad have already mailed their proxy materials to surge shareholders they criticize the fact that surge rents office space from an entity owned in part by ira levy and steve lubman but the reality is that this is an arm’s length transaction that is set at fair market value was approved by the independent directors of the board and has been fully disclosed in the sec filings of the company their complaint about our auditor is without merit it is perfectly legal and is not a conflict of interest for an auditor to perform work for others their criticism of executive compensation is baseless from  a difficult time in the electronic components industry ira levy and steve lubman were not granted any equity compensation that changed only when they had turned around the company after  having strengthened sales and profits since  surge’s stock has since increased  ira and steve’s compensation is heavily dependent on meeting business incentives they have issued statements that we believe completely mischaracterize the company’s recently adopted nol shareholder rights plan this plan was adopted to protect very valuable net operating loss carryforwards “nols” – estimated at over  million for the longterm benefit of the company and its shareholders this plan is up for vote by shareholders at the upcoming annual meeting – leaving it up to you whether this protection remains in effect our strategic plan is working – our continued results bear this out now is not the time for a rushed sale of the company unfortunately two individuals have chosen to wage a costly and distracting proxy fight to pursue their own

annual meeting of shareholders  decision follows demand by dissident shareholders to delay meeting  november    am eastern standard time deer park nybusiness wiresurge components inc “surge” or the “company” otc pinksprs a leading supplier of capacitors discrete semiconductors and audiblesounding devices announced today that its board of directors has postponed the company’s annual meeting of shareholders to january   the board issued the following statement in conjunction with this announcement “we have decided to postpone the annual meeting in order to ensure all surge shareholders are given sufficient time to make an informed decision about their votes recently dissident shareholders michael tofias and bradley rexroad brought a lawsuit against surge in nevada urging the company to delay the date of the annual meeting and turn over shareholder information we were surprised by the demand to delay the annual meeting given that the meeting date was validly set by the company and the dissidents never made this demand previously also under the clear and unambiguous language of the relevant statute the dissidents are not entitled to the requested shareholder information however our commitment to shareholder democracy and transparency remains steadfast and this lawsuit is a time consuming distraction from the important issues at hand and is wasting the company’s and shareholders’ resources therefore we have shared the shareholder information with messrs tofias and rexroad even though we have no obligation under the statute to do so and decided to consent to their demand to delay the annual meeting date we continue to firmly believe that electing messrs tofias and rexroad to the board of surge and immediately pursuing a sale process is not in the best interests of the company and all shareholders we remind shareholders that tofias and rexroad have not put forth a plan for growing surge and delivering increased shareholder value beyond simply displacing your experienced cofounders – ira levy and steve lubman – from the board and urging a prompt sale of the company these “plans” would leave the company and its shareholders without a clear direction would only serve to satisfy the shortterm interests of these dissident shareholders and would rob you of longterm value creation we therefore urge all shareholders to support our nominations of ira levy and steve lubman who each has  years of experience in the electronics components industry who together have built the company into what it is today and who are deploying a successful strategy to deliver enhanced longterm value to all shareholders vote today on the gold proxy card to pave the way for continued growth and value creation at surge” about surge components inc founded in november  surge is
