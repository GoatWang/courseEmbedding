typically financed first the new firm seeks out seed capital and funding from angel investors and accelerators then if the firm can survive through the valley of death–the period where the firm is trying to develop on a shoestring budget–the firm can seek venture capital financing history of private equity and venture capital early history origins of modern private equity the s leveraged buyout boom the s leveraged buyout and the venture capital bubble the s dotcom bubble to the credit crunch v t e venture capital vc is a type of private equity a form of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small earlystage emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees annual revenue or both venture capital firms or funds invest in these earlystage companies in exchange for equity or an ownership stake in the companies they invest in venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky startups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful the startups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries such as information technology it clean technology or biotechnology the typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round the first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the series a round venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ipo or doing a merger and acquisition also known as a trade sale of the company in addition to angel investing equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering in exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and earlystage companies venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions in addition to a significant portion of the companies ownership and consequently value startups like uber airbnb flipkart reviewadda xiaomi  didi chuxing are highly valued startups where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these earlystage firms they also often provide strategic advice to the firms executives on its business model and marketing strategies venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop this institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance technical expertise mentoring marketing knowhow and business models once integrated into the business network these firms are more likely to succeed as they become nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain however venture capitalists

defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment with few exceptions private equity in the first half of the th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families the wallenbergs vanderbilts whitneys rockefellers and warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century in  laurance s rockefeller helped finance the creation of both eastern air lines and douglas aircraft and the rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies eric m warburg founded em warburg  co in  which would ultimately become warburg pincus with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital the wallenberg family started investor ab in  in sweden and were early investors in several swedish companies such as abb atlas copco ericsson etc in the first half of the th century origins of modern private equity before world war ii – money orders originally known as development capital remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families only after  did true private equity investments begin to emerge notably with the founding of the first two venture capital firms in  american research and development corporation ardc and jh whitney  company georges doriot the father of venture capitalism and former assistant dean of harvard business school founded insead in  along with ralph flanders and karl compton former president of mit doriot founded ardc in  to encourage privatesector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from world war ii ardc became the first institutional privateequity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well ardc is creditedby whom with the first trick when its  investment of  in digital equipment corporation dec would be valued at over  million after the companys initial public offering in  representing a return of over  times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of  former employees of ardc went on to establish several prominent venturecapital firms including greylock partners founded in  by charlie waite and bill elfers and morgan holland ventures the predecessor of flagship ventures founded in  by james morgan ardc continued investing until  when doriot retired in  doriot merged ardc with textron after having invested in over  companies john hay whitney – and his partner benno schmidt – founded jh whitney  company in  whitney had been investing since the s founding pioneer pictures in  and acquiring a  interest in technicolor corporation with his cousin cornelius vanderbilt whitney florida foods corporation proved whitneys most famous investment the company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to american soldiers later known as minute maid orange juice and was sold to the cocacola company in  jh whitney  company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised  million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in  early venture capital and the growth of silicon valley a highway exit for sand hill road in menlo park california where many bay area venture capital firms are based one of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the small business investment act of  the  act officially allowed the us small business administration sba to license private small business investment companies sbics to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the united states during the s putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to compete the transaction it was a business that was growing very rapidly and as the business grew the transactions grew exponentially during the s and s venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies more often than not these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic medical or dataprocessing technology as a result venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance an early west coast venture capital company was draper and johnson investment company formed in  by william henry draper iii and franklin p johnson jr in  sutter hill ventures acquired the portfolio of draper and johnson as a founding action bill draper and paul wythes were the founders and pitch johnson formed asset management company at that time it is commonly noted that the first venturebacked startup is fairchild semiconductor which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit funded in  by what would later become venrock associates venrock was founded in  by laurance s rockefeller the fourth of john d rockefellers six children as a way to allow other rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments it was also in the s that the common form of private equity fund still in use today emerged private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors who were passive limited partners put up the capital the compensation structure still in use today also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of – and a carried interest typically representing up to  of the profits of the partnership the growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on sand hill road beginning with kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital in  located in menlo park ca kleiner perkins sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the santa clara valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies throughout the s a group of private equity firms focused primarily on venture capital investments would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms in  with the number of new venture capital firms increasing leading venture capitalists formed the national venture capital association nvca the nvca was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in  when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund it was not until  that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year as the industry raised approximately  million with the passage of the employee retirement income security act erisa in  corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies in  the us labor department relaxed certain of the erisa restrictions under the prudent man rule thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists s the public successes of the venture capital industry in the s and early s eg digital equipment corporation apple inc genentech gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms from just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade there were over  firms by the end of the s each searching for the next major home run the number of firms multiplied and the capital managed by these firms increased from  billion to  billion over the course of the decade the growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time in addition to the increased competition among firms several other factors affected returns the market for initial public offerings cooled in the mids before collapsing after the stock market crash in  and foreign corporations particularly from japan and korea flooded earlystage companies with capital in response to the changing conditions corporations that had sponsored inhouse venture investment arms including general electric and paine webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units additionally venture capital units within chemical bank and continental illinois national bank among others began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies even industry founders jh whitney  company and warburg pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments venture capital boom and the internet bubble by the end of the s venture capital returns were relatively low particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins due in part to the competition for hot startups excess supply of ipos and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the s and the first half of the s increasing from  billion in  to just over  billion more than a decade later in  after a shakeout of venture capital managers the more successful firms retrenched focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments results would begin to turn very attractive successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the s yale school of management professor andrew metrick refers to these first  years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in  as the preboom period in anticipation of the boom that would begin in  and last through the bursting of the internet bubble in  the late s were a boom time for venture capital as firms on sand hill road in menlo park and silicon valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent internet and other computer technologies initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance and venture firms were reaping large returns private equity crash the technologyheavy nasdaq composite index peaked at  in march  reflecting the high point of the dotcom bubble the nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in march  shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed over the next two years many venture firms had been forced to writeoff large proportions of their investments and many funds were significant under water the values of the funds investments were below the amount of capital invested venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds and in numerous instances investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market by mid the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its  capacity nevertheless pricewaterhousecoopers moneytree survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at  levels through the second quarter of  although the postboom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in  they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from  through  as a percentage of gdp venture investment was  in  peaked at  nearly  times the  level in  and ranged from  to  in  and  the revival of an internetdriven environment in  through  helped to revive the venture capital environment however as a percentage of the overall private equity market venture capital has still not reached its mids level let alone its peak in  venture capital funds which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in  the height of the dotcom bubble raised only  billion in  a  decline from  and a significant decline from its peak funding obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business the return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business this return is generally earned when the venture capitalist exits by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in as a result firms are looking for the extremely rare yet soughtafter qualities such as innovative technology potential for rapid growth a welldeveloped business model and an impressive management team of these qualities funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame typically – years that venture capitalists expect because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an ipo stage when valuations are favourable venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the companys development idea generation startup ramp up and exit because there are no public exchanges listing their securities private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways including warm referrals from the investors trusted sources and other business contacts investor conferences and symposia and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in facetoface meetings including a variant known as speed venturing which is akin to speeddating for capital where the investor decides within  minutes whether he wants a followup meeting in addition some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors this need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies and most suitable for businesses having large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt that is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software and other intellectual property whose value is unproven in turn this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fastgrowing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields if a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan a good management team investment and passion from the founders a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle and target minimum returns in excess of  per year it will find it easier to raise venture capital financing stages there are typically six stages of venture round financing offered in venture capital that roughly correspond to these stages of a companys development seed funding the earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea often provided by angel investors equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding startup early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development growth series a round early sales and manufacturing funds this is typically where vcs come in series a can be thought of as the first institutional round subsequent investment rounds are called series b series c and so on this is where most companies will have the most growth secondround working capital for early stage companies that are selling product but not yet turning a profit this can also be called series b round and so on expansion also called mezzanine financing this is expansion money for a newly profitable company exit of venture capitalist vcs can exit through secondary sale or an ipo or an acquisition early stage vcs may exit in later rounds when new investors vcs or private equity investors buy the shares of existing investors sometimes a company very close to an ipo may allow some vcs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the ipo bridge financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full vc rounds the objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate between the first round and the fourth round venturebacked companies may also seek to take venture debt firms and funds venture capitalists a venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments a venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle in the united states often an lp or llc that primarily invests the financial capital of thirdparty investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans these funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds scientists researchers business training andor deep industry experience a core skill within vc is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage by definition vcs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage thus adding skills as well as capital thereby differentiating vc from buyout private equity which typically invest in companies with proven revenue and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of ones investment in a given startup company as a consequence most venture capital investments are done in a pool format where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies by investing in the pool format the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund structure venture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised venture capital firms in the united states may also be structured as limited liability companies in which case the firms managers are known as managing members investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners this constituency comprises both highnetworth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital such as state and private pension funds university financial endowments foundations insurance companies and pooled investment vehicles called funds of funds types venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations  and approaches there are multiple factors and each firm is different some of the factors that influence vc decisions include business situation some vcs tend to invest in new disruptive ideas or fledgling companies others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow some invest solely in certain industries some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally vc expectations can often vary some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth the amount of help a vc provides can vary from one firm to the next roles within the venture capital industry the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as venture capitalists or vcs typical career backgrounds vary but broadly speaking venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background venture capitalists with an operational background operating partner tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm other positions at venture capital firms include position role general partners or gps they run the venture capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund gps typically put in personal capital up to  of the vc fund size to show their commitment to the lps venture partners venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities bring in deals and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved principal this is a midlevel investment professional position and often considered a partnertrack position principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field such as investment banking management consulting or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm associate this is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm after a few successful years an associate may move up to the senior associate position and potentially principal and beyond associates will often have worked for – years in another field such as investment banking or management consulting entrepreneurinresidence entrepreneursinresidence eirs are experts in a particular industry sector eg biotechnology or social media and perform due diligence on potential deals eirs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily six to  months and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm although neither party is bound to work with each other some eirs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company structure of the funds most venture capital funds have a fixed life of  years with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity the investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years after which the focus is managing and making followon investments in an existing portfolio this model was pioneered by successful funds in silicon valley through the s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product in such a fund the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently called down by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments there are substantial penalties for a limited partner or investor that fails to participate in a capital call it can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund at the time when all of the money has been raised the fund is said to be closed and the year lifetime begins some funds have partial closes when one half or some other amount of the fund has been raised the vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify vc funds for comparison this shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them from investors point of view funds can be  traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms or  asymmetric—where different investors have different terms typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where theres an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors compensation main article carried interest venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest often referred to as a two and  arrangement payment implementation management fees an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the funds manager to pay for the private equity firms investment operations in a typical venture capital fund the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to  of the committed capital carried interest a share of the profits of the fund typically  paid to the private equity funds management company as a performance incentive the remaining  of the profits are paid to the funds investors strong limited partner interest in toptier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership and certain groups are able to command carried interest of – on their funds because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts by the time the fund cashes out an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending whom the general partners may not know well and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know alternatives because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur furthermore many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a startup company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology andor market potential for its product or services to achieve this or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven many startups seek to selffinance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors this practice is called bootstrapping equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations while such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding such as those listed at comparison of crowd funding services one of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional vc model the traditional vcs are shifting their focus to laterstage investments and return on investment of many vc funds have been low or negative in europe and india media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding media for equity investors are able to supply startups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity in europe an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding mergers and acquisition or other exit strategy in industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth good examples would include assetintensive extractive industries such as mining or manufacturing industries offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts which seek to utilise securitization in structuring hybrid multimarket transactions via an spv special purpose vehicle a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing in addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks groups have emerged which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it other forms include venture resources that seek to provide nonmonetary support to launch a new venture societal impact venture capital is also associated with job creation accounting for  of us gdp the knowledge economy and used as a proxy measure of innovation within an economic sector or geography every year there are nearly  million businesses created in the usa and – get venture capital funding according to the national venture capital association  of private sector jobs come from venturebacked companies and venturebacked revenue accounts for  of us gdp babson colleges diana report found that the number of women partners in vc firms decreased from  in  to  in  the report also found that  of vcfunded businesses had male chief executives and that businesses with allmale teams were more than four times as likely to receive vc funding compared to teams with at least one woman more than  of vc firms in the us did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed it was found that a greater fraction of vc firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies for comparison a uc davis study focusing on large public companies in california found  with at least one female board seat when the latter results were published some san jose mercury news readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause in a followup newsweek article nina burleigh asked where were all these offended people when women like heidi roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed geographical differences venture capital as an industry originated in the united states and american firms have traditionally been the largest participants in venture deals with the bulk of venture capital being deployed in american companies however increasingly nonus venture investment is growing and the number and size of nonus venture capitalists have been expanding venture capital has been used as a tool for economic development in a variety of developing regions in many of these regions with less developed financial sectors venture capital plays a role in facilitating access

earlystage emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees annual revenue or both venture capital firms or funds invest in these earlystage companies in exchange for equity or an ownership stake in the companies they invest in venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky startups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful the startups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries such as information technology it clean technology or biotechnology the typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round the first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the series a round venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ipo or doing a merger and acquisition also known as a trade sale of the company in addition to angel investing equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering in exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and earlystage companies venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions in addition to a significant portion of the companies ownership and consequently value startups like uber airbnb flipkart reviewadda xiaomi  didi chuxing are highly valued startups where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these earlystage firms they also often provide strategic advice to the firms executives on its business model and marketing strategies venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop this institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance technical expertise mentoring marketing knowhow and business models once integrated into the business network these firms are more likely to succeed as they become nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain however venture capitalists

defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment with few exceptions private equity in the first half of the th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families the wallenbergs vanderbilts whitneys rockefellers and warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century in  laurance s rockefeller helped finance the creation of both eastern air lines and douglas aircraft and the rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies eric m warburg founded em warburg  co in  which would ultimately become warburg pincus with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital the wallenberg family started investor ab in  in sweden and were early investors in several swedish companies such as abb atlas copco ericsson etc in the first half of the th century origins of modern private equity before world war ii – money orders originally known as development capital remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families only after  did true private equity investments begin to emerge notably with the founding of the first two venture capital firms in  american research and development corporation ardc and jh whitney  company georges doriot the father of venture capitalism and former assistant dean of harvard business school founded insead in  along with ralph flanders and karl compton former president of mit doriot founded ardc in  to encourage privatesector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from world war ii ardc became the first institutional privateequity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well ardc is creditedby whom with the first trick when its  investment of  in digital equipment corporation dec would be valued at over  million after the companys initial public offering in  representing a return of over  times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of  former employees of ardc went on to establish several prominent venturecapital firms including greylock partners founded in  by charlie waite and bill elfers and morgan holland ventures the predecessor of flagship ventures founded in  by james morgan ardc continued investing until  when doriot retired in  doriot merged ardc with textron after having invested in over  companies john hay whitney – and his partner benno schmidt – founded jh whitney  company in  whitney had been investing since the s founding pioneer pictures in  and acquiring a  interest in technicolor corporation with his cousin cornelius vanderbilt whitney florida foods corporation proved whitneys most famous investment the company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to american soldiers later known as minute maid orange juice and was sold to the cocacola company in  jh whitney  company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised  million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in  early venture capital and the growth of silicon valley a highway exit for sand hill road in menlo park california where many bay area venture capital firms are based one of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the small business investment act of  the  act officially allowed the us small business administration sba to license private small business investment companies sbics to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the united states during the s putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to compete the transaction it was a business that was growing very rapidly and as the business grew the transactions grew exponentially during the s and s venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies more often than not these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic medical or dataprocessing technology as a result venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance an early west coast venture capital company was draper and johnson investment company formed in  by william henry draper iii and franklin p johnson jr in  sutter hill ventures acquired the portfolio of draper and johnson as a founding action bill draper and paul wythes were the founders and pitch johnson formed asset management company at that time it is commonly noted that the first venturebacked startup is fairchild semiconductor which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit funded in  by what would later become venrock associates venrock was founded in  by laurance s rockefeller the fourth of john d rockefellers six children as a way to allow other rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments it was also in the s that the common form of private equity fund still in use today emerged private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors who were passive limited partners put up the capital the compensation structure still in use today also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of – and a carried interest typically representing up to  of the profits of the partnership the growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on sand hill road beginning with kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital in  located in menlo park ca kleiner perkins sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the santa clara valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies throughout the s a group of private equity firms focused primarily on venture capital investments would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms in  with the number of new venture capital firms increasing leading venture capitalists formed the national venture capital association nvca the nvca was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in  when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund it was not until  that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year as the industry raised approximately  million with the passage of the employee retirement income security act erisa in  corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies in  the us labor department relaxed certain of the erisa restrictions under the prudent man rule thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists s the public successes of the venture capital industry in the s and early s eg digital equipment corporation apple inc genentech gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms from just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade there were over  firms by the end of the s each searching for the next major home run the number of firms multiplied and the capital managed by these firms increased from  billion to  billion over the course of the decade the growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time in addition to the increased competition among firms several other factors affected returns the market for initial public offerings cooled in the mids before collapsing after the stock market crash in  and foreign corporations particularly from japan and korea flooded earlystage companies with capital in response to the changing conditions corporations that had sponsored inhouse venture investment arms including general electric and paine webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units additionally venture capital units within chemical bank and continental illinois national bank among others began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies even industry founders jh whitney  company and warburg pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments venture capital boom and the internet bubble by the end of the s venture capital returns were relatively low particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins due in part to the competition for hot startups excess supply of ipos and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the s and the first half of the s increasing from  billion in  to just over  billion more than a decade later in  after a shakeout of venture capital managers the more successful firms retrenched focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments results would begin to turn very attractive successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the s yale school of management professor andrew metrick refers to these first  years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in  as the preboom period in anticipation of the boom that would begin in  and last through the bursting of the internet bubble in  the late s were a boom time for venture capital as firms on sand hill road in menlo park and silicon valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent internet and other computer technologies initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance and venture firms were reaping large returns private equity crash the technologyheavy nasdaq composite index peaked at  in march  reflecting the high point of the dotcom bubble the nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in march  shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed over the next two years many venture firms had been forced to writeoff large proportions of their investments and many funds were significant under water the values of the funds investments were below the amount of capital invested venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds and in numerous instances investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market by mid the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its  capacity nevertheless pricewaterhousecoopers moneytree survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at  levels through the second quarter of  although the postboom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in  they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from  through  as a percentage of gdp venture investment was  in  peaked at  nearly  times the  level in  and ranged from  to  in  and  the revival of an internetdriven environment in  through  helped to revive the venture capital environment however as a percentage of the overall private equity market venture capital has still not reached its mids level let alone its peak in  venture capital funds which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in  the height of the dotcom bubble raised only  billion in  a  decline from  and a significant decline from its peak funding obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business the return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business this return is generally earned when the venture capitalist exits by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in as a result firms are looking for the extremely rare yet soughtafter qualities such as innovative technology potential for rapid growth a welldeveloped business model and an impressive management team of these qualities funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame typically – years that venture capitalists expect because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an ipo stage when valuations are favourable venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the companys development idea generation startup ramp up and exit because there are no public exchanges listing their securities private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways including warm referrals from the investors trusted sources and other business contacts investor conferences and symposia and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in facetoface meetings including a variant known as speed venturing which is akin to speeddating for capital where the investor decides within  minutes whether he wants a followup meeting in addition some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors this need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies and most suitable for businesses having large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt that is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software and other intellectual property whose value is unproven in turn this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fastgrowing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields if a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan a good management team investment and passion from the founders a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle and target minimum returns in excess of  per year it will find it easier to raise venture capital financing stages there are typically six stages of venture round financing offered in venture capital that roughly correspond to these stages of a companys development seed funding the earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea often provided by angel investors equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding startup early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development growth series a round early sales and manufacturing funds this is typically where vcs come in series a can be thought of as the first institutional round subsequent investment rounds are called series b series c and so on this is where most companies will have the most growth secondround working capital for early stage companies that are selling product but not yet turning a profit this can also be called series b round and so on expansion also called mezzanine financing this is expansion money for a newly profitable company exit of venture capitalist vcs can exit through secondary sale or an ipo or an acquisition early stage vcs may exit in later rounds when new investors vcs or private equity investors buy the shares of existing investors sometimes a company very close to an ipo may allow some vcs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the ipo bridge financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full vc rounds the objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate between the first round and the fourth round venturebacked companies may also seek to take venture debt firms and funds venture capitalists a venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments a venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle in the united states often an lp or llc that primarily invests the financial capital of thirdparty investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans these funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds scientists researchers business training andor deep industry experience a core skill within vc is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage by definition vcs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage thus adding skills as well as capital thereby differentiating vc from buyout private equity which typically invest in companies with proven revenue and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of ones investment in a given startup company as a consequence most venture capital investments are done in a pool format where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies by investing in the pool format the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund structure venture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised venture capital firms in the united states may also be structured as limited liability companies in which case the firms managers are known as managing members investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners this constituency comprises both highnetworth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital such as state and private pension funds university financial endowments foundations insurance companies and pooled investment vehicles called funds of funds types venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations  and approaches there are multiple factors and each firm is different some of the factors that influence vc decisions include business situation some vcs tend to invest in new disruptive ideas or fledgling companies others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow some invest solely in certain industries some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally vc expectations can often vary some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth the amount of help a vc provides can vary from one firm to the next roles within the venture capital industry the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as venture capitalists or vcs typical career backgrounds vary but broadly speaking venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background venture capitalists with an operational background operating partner tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm other positions at venture capital firms include position role general partners or gps they run the venture capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund gps typically put in personal capital up to  of the vc fund size to show their commitment to the lps venture partners venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities bring in deals and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved principal this is a midlevel investment professional position and often considered a partnertrack position principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field such as investment banking management consulting or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm associate this is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm after a few successful years an associate may move up to the senior associate position and potentially principal and beyond associates will often have worked for – years in another field such as investment banking or management consulting entrepreneurinresidence entrepreneursinresidence eirs are experts in a particular industry sector eg biotechnology or social media and perform due diligence on potential deals eirs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily six to  months and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm although neither party is bound to work with each other some eirs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company structure of the funds most venture capital funds have a fixed life of  years with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity the investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years after which the focus is managing and making followon investments in an existing portfolio this model was pioneered by successful funds in silicon valley through the s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product in such a fund the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently called down by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments there are substantial penalties for a limited partner or investor that fails to participate in a capital call it can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund at the time when all of the money has been raised the fund is said to be closed and the year lifetime begins some funds have partial closes when one half or some other amount of the fund has been raised the vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify vc funds for comparison this shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them from investors point of view funds can be  traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms or  asymmetric—where different investors have different terms typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where theres an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors compensation main article carried interest venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest often referred to as a two and  arrangement payment implementation management fees an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the funds manager to pay for the private equity firms investment operations in a typical venture capital fund the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to  of the committed capital carried interest a share of the profits of the fund typically  paid to the private equity funds management company as a performance incentive the remaining  of the profits are paid to the funds investors strong limited partner interest in toptier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership and certain groups are able to command carried interest of – on their funds because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts by the time the fund cashes out an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending whom the general partners may not know well and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know alternatives because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur furthermore many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a startup company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology andor market potential for its product or services to achieve this or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven many startups seek to selffinance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors this practice is called bootstrapping equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations while such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding such as those listed at comparison of crowd funding services one of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional vc model the traditional vcs are shifting their focus to laterstage investments and return on investment of many vc funds have been low or negative in europe and india media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding media for equity investors are able to supply startups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity in europe an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding mergers and acquisition or other exit strategy in industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth good examples would include assetintensive extractive industries such as mining or manufacturing industries offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts which seek to utilise securitization in structuring hybrid multimarket transactions via an spv special purpose vehicle a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing in addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks groups have emerged which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it other forms include venture resources that seek to provide nonmonetary support to launch a new venture societal impact venture capital is also associated with job creation accounting for  of us gdp the knowledge economy and used as a proxy measure of innovation within an economic sector or geography every year there are nearly  million businesses created in the usa and – get venture capital funding according to the national venture capital association  of private sector jobs come from venturebacked companies and venturebacked revenue accounts for  of us gdp babson colleges diana report found that the number of women partners in vc firms decreased from  in  to  in  the report also found that  of vcfunded businesses had male chief executives and that businesses with allmale teams were more than four times as likely to receive vc funding compared to teams with at least one woman more than  of vc firms in the us did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed it was found that a greater fraction of vc firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies for comparison a uc davis study focusing on large public companies in california found  with at least one female board seat when the latter results were published some san jose mercury news readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause in a followup newsweek article

buyout and the venture capital bubble the s dotcom bubble to the credit crunch v t e venture capital vc is a type of private equity a form of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small earlystage emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees annual revenue or both venture capital firms or funds invest in these earlystage companies in exchange for equity or an ownership stake in the companies they invest in venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky startups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful the startups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries such as information technology it clean technology or biotechnology the typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round the first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the series a round venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ipo or doing a merger and acquisition also known as a trade sale of the company in addition to angel investing equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering in exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and earlystage companies venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions in addition to a significant portion of the companies ownership and consequently value startups like uber airbnb flipkart reviewadda xiaomi  didi chuxing are highly valued startups where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these earlystage firms they also often provide strategic advice to the firms executives on its business model and marketing strategies venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop this institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance technical expertise mentoring marketing knowhow and business models once integrated into the business network these firms are more likely to succeed as they become nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain however venture capitalists

defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment with few exceptions private equity in the first half of the th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families the wallenbergs vanderbilts whitneys rockefellers and warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century in  laurance s rockefeller helped finance the creation of both eastern air lines and douglas aircraft and the rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies eric m warburg founded em warburg  co in  which would ultimately become warburg pincus with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital the wallenberg family started investor ab in  in sweden and were early investors in several swedish companies such as abb atlas copco ericsson etc in the first half of the th century origins of modern private equity before world war ii – money orders originally known as development capital remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families only after  did true private equity investments begin to emerge notably with the founding of the first two venture capital firms in  american research and development corporation ardc and jh whitney  company georges doriot the father of venture capitalism and former assistant dean of harvard business school founded insead in  along with ralph flanders and karl compton former president of mit doriot founded ardc in  to encourage privatesector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from world war ii ardc became the first institutional privateequity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well ardc is creditedby whom with the first trick when its  investment of  in digital equipment corporation dec would be valued at over  million after the companys initial public offering in  representing a return of over  times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of  former employees of ardc went on to establish several prominent venturecapital firms including greylock partners founded in  by charlie waite and bill elfers and morgan holland ventures the predecessor of flagship ventures founded in  by james morgan ardc continued investing until  when doriot retired in  doriot merged ardc with textron after having invested in over  companies john hay whitney – and his partner benno schmidt – founded jh whitney  company in  whitney had been investing since the s founding pioneer pictures in  and acquiring a  interest in technicolor corporation with his cousin cornelius vanderbilt whitney florida foods corporation proved whitneys most famous investment the company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to american soldiers later known as minute maid orange juice and was sold to the cocacola company in  jh whitney  company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised  million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in  early venture capital and the growth of silicon valley a highway exit for sand hill road in menlo park california where many bay area venture capital firms are based one of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the small business investment act of  the  act officially allowed the us small business administration sba to license private small business investment companies sbics to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the united states during the s putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to compete the transaction it was a business that was growing very rapidly and as the business grew the transactions grew exponentially during the s and s venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies more often than not these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic medical or dataprocessing technology as a result venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance an early west coast venture capital company was draper and johnson investment company formed in  by william henry draper iii and franklin p johnson jr in  sutter hill ventures acquired the portfolio of draper and johnson as a founding action bill draper and paul wythes were the founders and pitch johnson formed asset management company at that time it is commonly noted that the first venturebacked startup is fairchild semiconductor which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit funded in  by what would later become venrock associates venrock was founded in  by laurance s rockefeller the fourth of john d rockefellers six children as a way to allow other rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments it was also in the s that the common form of private equity fund still in use today emerged private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors who were passive limited partners put up the capital the compensation structure still in use today also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of – and a carried interest typically representing up to  of the profits of the partnership the growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on sand hill road beginning with kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital in  located in menlo park ca kleiner perkins sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the santa clara valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies throughout the s a group of private equity firms focused primarily on venture capital investments would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms in  with the number of new venture capital firms increasing leading venture capitalists formed the national venture capital association nvca the nvca was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in  when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund it was not until  that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year as the industry raised approximately  million with the passage of the employee retirement income security act erisa in  corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies in  the us labor department relaxed certain of the erisa restrictions under the prudent man rule thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists s the public successes of the venture capital industry in the s and early s eg digital equipment corporation apple inc genentech gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms from just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade there were over  firms by the end of the s each searching for the next major home run the number of firms multiplied and the capital managed by these firms increased from  billion to  billion over the course of the decade the growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time in addition to the increased competition among firms several other factors affected returns the market for initial public offerings cooled in the mids before collapsing after the stock market crash in  and foreign corporations particularly from japan and korea flooded earlystage companies with capital in response to the changing conditions corporations that had sponsored inhouse venture investment arms including general electric and paine webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units additionally venture capital units within chemical bank and continental illinois national bank among others began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies even industry founders jh whitney  company and warburg pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments venture capital boom and the internet bubble by the end of the s venture capital returns were relatively low particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins due in part to the competition for hot startups excess supply of ipos and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the s and the first half of the s increasing from  billion in  to just over  billion more than a decade later in  after a shakeout of venture capital managers the more successful firms retrenched focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments results would begin to turn very attractive successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the s yale school of management professor andrew metrick refers to these first  years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in  as the preboom period in anticipation of the boom that would begin in  and last through the bursting of the internet bubble in  the late s were a boom time for venture capital as firms on sand hill road in menlo park and silicon valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent internet and other computer technologies initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance and venture firms were reaping large returns private equity crash the technologyheavy nasdaq composite index peaked at  in march  reflecting the high point of the dotcom bubble the nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in march  shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed over the next two years many venture firms had been forced to writeoff large proportions of their investments and many funds were significant under water the values of the funds investments were below the amount of capital invested venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds and in numerous instances investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market by mid the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its  capacity nevertheless pricewaterhousecoopers moneytree survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at  levels through the second quarter of  although the postboom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in  they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from  through  as a percentage of gdp venture investment was  in  peaked at  nearly  times the  level in  and ranged from  to  in  and  the revival of an internetdriven environment in  through  helped to revive the venture capital environment however as a percentage of the overall private equity market venture capital has still not reached its mids level let alone its peak in  venture capital funds which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in  the height of the dotcom bubble raised only  billion in  a  decline from  and a significant decline from its peak funding obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business the return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business this return is generally earned when the venture capitalist exits by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in as a result firms are looking for the extremely rare yet soughtafter qualities such as innovative technology potential for rapid growth a welldeveloped business model and an impressive management team of these qualities funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame typically – years that venture capitalists expect because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an ipo stage when valuations are favourable venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the companys development idea generation startup ramp up and exit because there are no public exchanges listing their securities private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways including warm referrals from the investors trusted sources and other business contacts investor conferences and symposia and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in facetoface meetings including a variant known as speed venturing which is akin to speeddating for capital where the investor decides within  minutes whether he wants a followup meeting in addition some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors this need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies and most suitable for businesses having large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt that is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software and other intellectual property whose value is unproven in turn this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fastgrowing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields if a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan a good management team investment and passion from the founders a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle and target minimum returns in excess of  per year it will find it easier to raise venture capital financing stages there are typically six stages of venture round financing offered in venture capital that roughly correspond to these stages of a companys development seed funding the earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea often provided by angel investors equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding startup early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development growth series a round early sales and manufacturing funds this is typically where vcs come in series a can be thought of as the first institutional round subsequent investment rounds are called series b series c and so on this is where most companies will have the most growth secondround working capital for early stage companies that are selling product but not yet turning a profit this can also be called series b round and so on expansion also called mezzanine financing this is expansion money for a newly profitable company exit of venture capitalist vcs can exit through secondary sale or an ipo or an acquisition early stage vcs may exit in later rounds when new investors vcs or private equity investors buy the shares of existing investors sometimes a company very close to an ipo may allow some vcs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the ipo bridge financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full vc rounds the objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate between the first round and the fourth round venturebacked companies may also seek to take venture debt firms and funds venture capitalists a venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments a venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle in the united states often an lp or llc that primarily invests the financial capital of thirdparty investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans these funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds scientists researchers business training andor deep industry experience a core skill within vc is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage by definition vcs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage thus adding skills as well as capital thereby differentiating vc from buyout private equity which typically invest in companies with proven revenue and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of ones investment in a given startup company as a consequence most venture capital investments are done in a pool format where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies by investing in the pool format the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund structure venture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised venture capital firms in the united states may also be structured as limited liability companies in which case the firms managers are known as managing members investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners this constituency comprises both highnetworth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital such as state and private pension funds university financial endowments foundations insurance companies and pooled investment vehicles called funds of funds types venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations  and approaches there are multiple factors and each firm is different some of the factors that influence vc decisions include business situation some vcs tend to invest in new disruptive ideas or fledgling companies others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow some invest solely in certain industries some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally vc expectations can often vary some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth the amount of help a vc provides can vary from one firm to the next roles within the venture capital industry the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as venture capitalists or vcs typical career backgrounds vary but broadly speaking venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background venture capitalists with an operational background operating partner tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm other positions at venture capital firms include position role general partners or gps they run the venture capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund gps typically put in personal capital up to  of the vc fund size to show their commitment to the lps venture partners venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities bring in deals and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved principal this is a midlevel investment professional position and often considered a partnertrack position principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field such as investment banking management consulting or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm associate this is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm after a few successful years an associate may move up to the senior associate position and potentially principal and beyond associates will often have worked for – years in another field such as investment banking or management consulting entrepreneurinresidence entrepreneursinresidence eirs are experts in a particular industry sector eg biotechnology or social media and perform due diligence on potential deals eirs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily six to  months and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm although neither party is bound to work with each other some eirs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company structure of the funds most venture capital funds have a fixed life of  years with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity the investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years after which the focus is managing and making followon investments in an existing portfolio this model was pioneered by successful funds in silicon valley through the s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product in such a fund the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently called down by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments there are substantial penalties for a limited partner or investor that fails to participate in a capital call it can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund at the time when all of the money has been raised the fund is said to be closed and the year lifetime begins some funds have partial closes when one half or some other amount of the fund has been raised the vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify vc funds for comparison this shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them from investors point of view funds can be  traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms or  asymmetric—where different investors have different terms typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where theres an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors compensation main article carried interest venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest often referred to as a two and  arrangement payment implementation management fees an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the funds manager to pay for the private equity firms investment operations in a typical venture capital fund the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to  of the committed capital carried interest a share of the profits of the fund typically  paid to the private equity funds management company as a performance incentive the remaining  of the profits are paid to the funds investors strong limited partner interest in toptier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership and certain groups are able to command carried interest of – on their funds because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts by the time the fund cashes out an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending whom the general partners may not know well and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know alternatives because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur furthermore many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a startup company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology andor market potential for its product or services to achieve this or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven many startups seek to selffinance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors this practice is called bootstrapping equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations while such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding such as those listed at comparison of crowd funding services one of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional vc model the traditional vcs are shifting their focus to laterstage investments and return on investment of many vc funds have been low or negative in europe and india media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding media for equity investors are able to supply startups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity in europe an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding mergers and acquisition or other exit strategy in industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth good examples would include assetintensive extractive industries such as mining or manufacturing industries offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts which seek to utilise securitization in structuring hybrid multimarket transactions via an spv special purpose vehicle a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing in addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks groups have emerged which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it other forms include venture resources that seek to provide nonmonetary support to launch a new venture societal impact venture capital is also associated with job creation accounting for  of us gdp the knowledge economy and used as a proxy measure of innovation within an economic sector or geography every year there are nearly  million businesses created in the usa and – get venture capital funding according to the national venture capital association  of private sector jobs come from venturebacked companies and venturebacked revenue accounts for  of us gdp babson colleges diana report found that the number of women partners in vc firms decreased from  in  to  in  the report also found that  of vcfunded businesses had male chief executives and that businesses with allmale teams were more than four times as likely to receive vc funding compared to teams with at least one woman more than  of vc firms in the us did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed it was found that a greater fraction of vc firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies for comparison a uc davis study focusing on large public companies in california found  with at least one female board seat when the latter results were published some san jose mercury news readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause in a followup newsweek article nina burleigh asked where were all these offended people when women like heidi roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed geographical differences venture capital as an industry originated in the united states and american firms have traditionally been the largest participants in venture deals with the bulk of venture capital being deployed in american companies however increasingly nonus venture investment is growing and the number and size of nonus venture capitalists have been expanding venture capital

shoestring budget–the firm can seek venture capital financing history of private equity and venture capital early history origins of modern private equity the s leveraged buyout boom the s leveraged buyout and the venture capital bubble the s dotcom bubble to the credit crunch v t e venture capital vc is a type of private equity a form of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small earlystage emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees annual revenue or both venture capital firms or funds invest in these earlystage companies in exchange for equity or an ownership stake in the companies they invest in venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky startups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful the startups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries such as information technology it clean technology or biotechnology the typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round the first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the series a round venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ipo or doing a merger and acquisition also known as a trade sale of the company in addition to angel investing equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering in exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and earlystage companies venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions in addition to a significant portion of the companies ownership and consequently value startups like uber airbnb flipkart reviewadda xiaomi  didi chuxing are highly valued startups where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these earlystage firms they also often provide strategic advice to the firms executives on its business model and marketing strategies venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop this institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance technical expertise mentoring marketing knowhow and business models once integrated into the business network these firms are more likely to succeed as they become nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain however venture capitalists

defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment with few exceptions private equity in the first half of the th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families the wallenbergs vanderbilts whitneys rockefellers and warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century in  laurance s rockefeller helped finance the creation of both eastern air lines and douglas aircraft and the rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies eric m warburg founded em warburg  co in  which would ultimately become warburg pincus with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital the wallenberg family started investor ab in  in sweden and were early investors in several swedish companies such as abb atlas copco ericsson etc in the first half of the th century origins of modern private equity before world war ii – money orders originally known as development capital remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families only after  did true private equity investments begin to emerge notably with the founding of the first two venture capital firms in  american research and development corporation ardc and jh whitney  company georges doriot the father of venture capitalism and former assistant dean of harvard business school founded insead in  along with ralph flanders and karl compton former president of mit doriot founded ardc in  to encourage privatesector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from world war ii ardc became the first institutional privateequity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well ardc is creditedby whom with the first trick when its  investment of  in digital equipment corporation dec would be valued at over  million after the companys initial public offering in  representing a return of over  times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of  former employees of ardc went on to establish several prominent venturecapital firms including greylock partners founded in  by charlie waite and bill elfers and morgan holland ventures the predecessor of flagship ventures founded in  by james morgan ardc continued investing until  when doriot retired in  doriot merged ardc with textron after having invested in over  companies john hay whitney – and his partner benno schmidt – founded jh whitney  company in  whitney had been investing since the s founding pioneer pictures in  and acquiring a  interest in technicolor corporation with his cousin cornelius vanderbilt whitney florida foods corporation proved whitneys most famous investment the company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to american soldiers later known as minute maid orange juice and was sold to the cocacola company in  jh whitney  company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised  million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in  early venture capital and the growth of silicon valley a highway exit for sand hill road in menlo park california where many bay area venture capital firms are based one of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the small business investment act of  the  act officially allowed the us small business administration sba to license private small business investment companies sbics to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the united states during the s putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to compete the transaction it was a business that was growing very rapidly and as the business grew the transactions grew exponentially during the s and s venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies more often than not these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic medical or dataprocessing technology as a result venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance an early west coast venture capital company was draper and johnson investment company formed in  by william henry draper iii and franklin p johnson jr in  sutter hill ventures acquired the portfolio of draper and johnson as a founding action bill draper and paul wythes were the founders and pitch johnson formed asset management company at that time it is commonly noted that the first venturebacked startup is fairchild semiconductor which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit funded in  by what would later become venrock associates venrock was founded in  by laurance s rockefeller the fourth of john d rockefellers six children as a way to allow other rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments it was also in the s that the common form of private equity fund still in use today emerged private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors who were passive limited partners put up the capital the compensation structure still in use today also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of – and a carried interest typically representing up to  of the profits of the partnership the growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on sand hill road beginning with kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital in  located in menlo park ca kleiner perkins sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the santa clara valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies throughout the s a group of private equity firms focused primarily on venture capital investments would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms in  with the number of new venture capital firms increasing leading venture capitalists formed the national venture capital association nvca the nvca was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in  when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund it was not until  that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year as the industry raised approximately  million with the passage of the employee retirement income security act erisa in  corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies in  the us labor department relaxed certain of the erisa restrictions under the prudent man rule thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists s the public successes of the venture capital industry in the s and early s eg digital equipment corporation apple inc genentech gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms from just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade there were over  firms by the end of the s each searching for the next major home run the number of firms multiplied and the capital managed by these firms increased from  billion to  billion over the course of the decade the growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time in addition to the increased competition among firms several other factors affected returns the market for initial public offerings cooled in the mids before collapsing after the stock market crash in  and foreign corporations particularly from japan and korea flooded earlystage companies with capital in response to the changing conditions corporations that had sponsored inhouse venture investment arms including general electric and paine webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units additionally venture capital units within chemical bank and continental illinois national bank among others began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies even industry founders jh whitney  company and warburg pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments venture capital boom and the internet bubble by the end of the s venture capital returns were relatively low particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins due in part to the competition for hot startups excess supply of ipos and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the s and the first half of the s increasing from  billion in  to just over  billion more than a decade later in  after a shakeout of venture capital managers the more successful firms retrenched focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments results would begin to turn very attractive successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the s yale school of management professor andrew metrick refers to these first  years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in  as the preboom period in anticipation of the boom that would begin in  and last through the bursting of the internet bubble in  the late s were a boom time for venture capital as firms on sand hill road in menlo park and silicon valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent internet and other computer technologies initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance and venture firms were reaping large returns private equity crash the technologyheavy nasdaq composite index peaked at  in march  reflecting the high point of the dotcom bubble the nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in march  shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed over the next two years many venture firms had been forced to writeoff large proportions of their investments and many funds were significant under water the values of the funds investments were below the amount of capital invested venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds and in numerous instances investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market by mid the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its  capacity nevertheless pricewaterhousecoopers moneytree survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at  levels through the second quarter of  although the postboom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in  they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from  through  as a percentage of gdp venture investment was  in  peaked at  nearly  times the  level in  and ranged from  to  in  and  the revival of an internetdriven environment in  through  helped to revive the venture capital environment however as a percentage of the overall private equity market venture capital has still not reached its mids level let alone its peak in  venture capital funds which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in  the height of the dotcom bubble raised only  billion in  a  decline from  and a significant decline from its peak funding obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business the return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business this return is generally earned when the venture capitalist exits by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in as a result firms are looking for the extremely rare yet soughtafter qualities such as innovative technology potential for rapid growth a welldeveloped business model and an impressive management team of these qualities funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame typically – years that venture capitalists expect because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an ipo stage when valuations are favourable venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the companys development idea generation startup ramp up and exit because there are no public exchanges listing their securities private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways including warm referrals from the investors trusted sources and other business contacts investor conferences and symposia and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in facetoface meetings including a variant known as speed venturing which is akin to speeddating for capital where the investor decides within  minutes whether he wants a followup meeting in addition some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors this need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies and most suitable for businesses having large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt that is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software and other intellectual property whose value is unproven in turn this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fastgrowing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields if a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan a good management team investment and passion from the founders a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle and target minimum returns in excess of  per year it will find it easier to raise venture capital financing stages there are typically six stages of venture round financing offered in venture capital that roughly correspond to these stages of a companys development seed funding the earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea often provided by angel investors equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding startup early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development growth series a round early sales and manufacturing funds this is typically where vcs come in series a can be thought of as the first institutional round subsequent investment rounds are called series b series c and so on this is where most companies will have the most growth secondround working capital for early stage companies that are selling product but not yet turning a profit this can also be called series b round and so on expansion also called mezzanine financing this is expansion money for a newly profitable company exit of venture capitalist vcs can exit through secondary sale or an ipo or an acquisition early stage vcs may exit in later rounds when new investors vcs or private equity investors buy the shares of existing investors sometimes a company very close to an ipo may allow some vcs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the ipo bridge financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full vc rounds the objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate between the first round and the fourth round venturebacked companies may also seek to take venture debt firms and funds venture capitalists a venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments a venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle in the united states often an lp or llc that primarily invests the financial capital of thirdparty investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans these funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds scientists researchers business training andor deep industry experience a core skill within vc is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage by definition vcs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage thus adding skills as well as capital thereby differentiating vc from buyout private equity which typically invest in companies with proven revenue and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of ones investment in a given startup company as a consequence most venture capital investments are done in a pool format where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies by investing in the pool format the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund structure venture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised venture capital firms in the united states may also be structured as limited liability companies in which case the firms managers are known as managing members investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners this constituency comprises both highnetworth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital such as state and private pension funds university financial endowments foundations insurance companies and pooled investment vehicles called funds of funds types venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations  and approaches there are multiple factors and each firm is different some of the factors that influence vc decisions include business situation some vcs tend to invest in new disruptive ideas or fledgling companies others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow some invest solely in certain industries some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally vc expectations can often vary some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth the amount of help a vc provides can vary from one firm to the next roles within the venture capital industry the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as venture capitalists or vcs typical career backgrounds vary but broadly speaking venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background venture capitalists with an operational background operating partner tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm other positions at venture capital firms include position role general partners or gps they run the venture capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund gps typically put in personal capital up to  of the vc fund size to show their commitment to the lps venture partners venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities bring in deals and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved principal this is a midlevel investment professional position and often considered a partnertrack position principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field such as investment banking management consulting or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm associate this is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm after a few successful years an associate may move up to the senior associate position and potentially principal and beyond associates will often have worked for – years in another field such as investment banking or management consulting entrepreneurinresidence entrepreneursinresidence eirs are experts in a particular industry sector eg biotechnology or social media and perform due diligence on potential deals eirs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily six to  months and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm although neither party is bound to work with each other some eirs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company structure of the funds most venture capital funds have a fixed life of  years with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity the investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years after which the focus is managing and making followon investments in an existing portfolio this model was pioneered by successful funds in silicon valley through the s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product in such a fund the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently called down by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments there are substantial penalties for a limited partner or investor that fails to participate in a capital call it can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund at the time when all of the money has been raised the fund is said to be closed and the year lifetime begins some funds have partial closes when one half or some other amount of the fund has been raised the vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify vc funds for comparison this shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them from investors point of view funds can be  traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms or  asymmetric—where different investors have different terms typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where theres an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors compensation main article carried interest venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest often referred to as a two and  arrangement payment implementation management fees an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the funds manager to pay for the private equity firms investment operations in a typical venture capital fund the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to  of the committed capital carried interest a share of the profits of the fund typically  paid to the private equity funds management company as a performance incentive the remaining  of the profits are paid to the funds investors strong limited partner interest in toptier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership and certain groups are able to command carried interest of – on their funds because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts by the time the fund cashes out an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending whom the general partners may not know well and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know alternatives because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur furthermore many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a startup company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology andor market potential for its product or services to achieve this or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven many startups seek to selffinance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors this practice is called bootstrapping equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations while such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding such as those listed at comparison of crowd funding services one of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional vc model the traditional vcs are shifting their focus to laterstage investments and return on investment of many vc funds have been low or negative in europe and india media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding media for equity investors are able to supply startups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity in europe an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding mergers and acquisition or other exit strategy in industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth good examples would include assetintensive extractive industries such as mining or manufacturing industries offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts which seek to utilise securitization in structuring hybrid multimarket transactions via an spv special purpose vehicle a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing in addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks groups have emerged which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it other forms include venture resources that seek to provide nonmonetary support to launch a new venture societal impact venture capital is also associated with job creation accounting for  of us gdp the knowledge economy and used as a proxy measure of innovation within an economic sector or geography every year there are nearly  million businesses created in the usa and – get venture capital funding according to the national venture capital association  of private sector jobs come from venturebacked companies and venturebacked revenue accounts for  of us gdp babson colleges diana report found that the number of women partners in vc firms decreased from  in  to  in  the report also found that  of vcfunded businesses had male chief executives and that businesses with allmale teams were more than four times as

earlystage emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees annual revenue or both venture capital firms or funds invest in these earlystage companies in exchange for equity or an ownership stake in the companies they invest in venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky startups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful the startups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries such as information technology it clean technology or biotechnology the typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round the first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the series a round venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ipo or doing a merger and acquisition also known as a trade sale of the company in addition to angel investing equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering in exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and earlystage companies venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions in addition to a significant portion of the companies ownership and consequently value startups like uber airbnb flipkart reviewadda xiaomi  didi chuxing are highly valued startups where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these earlystage firms they also often provide strategic advice to the firms executives on its business model and marketing strategies venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop this institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance technical expertise mentoring marketing knowhow and business models once integrated into the business network these firms are more likely to succeed as they become nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain however venture capitalists

defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment with few exceptions private equity in the first half of the th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families the wallenbergs vanderbilts whitneys rockefellers and warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century in  laurance s rockefeller helped finance the creation of both eastern air lines and douglas aircraft and the rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies eric m warburg founded em warburg  co in  which would ultimately become warburg pincus with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital the wallenberg family started investor ab in  in sweden and were early investors in several swedish companies such as abb atlas copco ericsson etc in the first half of the th century origins of modern private equity before world war ii – money orders originally known as development capital remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families only after  did true private equity investments begin to emerge notably with the founding of the first two venture capital firms in  american research and development corporation ardc and jh whitney  company georges doriot the father of venture capitalism and former assistant dean of harvard business school founded insead in  along with ralph flanders and karl compton former president of mit doriot founded ardc in  to encourage privatesector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from world war ii ardc became the first institutional privateequity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well ardc is creditedby whom with the first trick when its  investment of  in digital equipment corporation dec would be valued at over  million after the companys initial public offering in  representing a return of over  times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of  former employees of ardc went on to establish several prominent venturecapital firms including greylock partners founded in  by charlie waite and bill elfers and morgan holland ventures the predecessor of flagship ventures founded in  by james morgan ardc continued investing until  when doriot retired in  doriot merged ardc with textron after having invested in over  companies john hay whitney – and his partner benno schmidt – founded jh whitney  company in  whitney had been investing since the s founding pioneer pictures in  and acquiring a

transactions and raised  million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in  early venture capital and the growth of silicon valley a highway exit for sand hill road in menlo park california where many bay area venture capital firms are based one of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the small business investment act of  the  act officially allowed the us small business administration sba to license private small business investment companies sbics to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the united states during the s putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to compete the transaction it was a business that was growing very rapidly and as the business grew the transactions grew exponentially during the s and s venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies more often than not these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic medical or dataprocessing technology as a result venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance an early west coast venture capital company was draper and johnson investment company formed in  by william henry draper iii and franklin p johnson jr in  sutter hill ventures acquired the portfolio of draper and johnson as a founding action bill draper and paul wythes were the founders and pitch johnson formed asset management company at that time it is commonly noted that the first venturebacked startup is fairchild semiconductor which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit funded in  by what would later become venrock associates venrock was founded in  by laurance s rockefeller the fourth of john d rockefellers six children as a way to allow other rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments it was also in the s that the common form of private equity fund still in use today emerged private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors who were passive limited partners put up the capital the compensation structure still in use today also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of – and a carried interest typically representing up to  of the profits of the partnership the growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on sand hill road beginning with kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital in  located in menlo park ca kleiner perkins sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the santa clara valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies throughout the s a group of private equity firms focused primarily on venture capital investments would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms in  with the number of new venture capital firms increasing leading venture capitalists formed the national venture capital association nvca the nvca was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in  when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund it was not until  that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year as the industry raised approximately  million with the passage of the employee retirement income security act erisa in  corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies in  the us labor department relaxed certain of the erisa restrictions under the prudent man rule thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists s the public successes of the venture capital industry in the s and early s eg digital equipment corporation apple inc genentech gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms from just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade there were over  firms by the end of the s each searching for the next major home run the number of firms multiplied and the capital managed by these firms increased from  billion to  billion over the course of the decade the growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time in addition to the increased competition among firms several other factors affected returns the market for initial public offerings cooled in the mids before collapsing after the stock market crash in  and foreign corporations particularly from japan and korea flooded earlystage companies with capital in response to the changing conditions corporations that had sponsored inhouse venture investment arms including general electric and paine webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units additionally venture capital units within chemical bank and continental illinois national bank among others began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies even industry founders jh whitney  company and warburg pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments venture capital boom and the internet bubble by the end of the s venture capital returns were relatively low particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins due in part to the competition for hot startups excess supply of ipos and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the s and the first half of the s increasing from  billion in  to just over  billion more than a decade later in  after a shakeout of venture capital managers the more successful firms retrenched focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments results would begin to turn very attractive successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the s yale school of management professor andrew metrick refers to these first  years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in  as the preboom period in anticipation of the boom that would begin in  and last through the bursting of the internet bubble in  the late s were a boom time for venture capital as firms on sand hill road in menlo park and silicon valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent internet and other computer technologies initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance and venture firms were reaping large returns private equity crash the technologyheavy nasdaq composite index peaked at  in march  reflecting the high point of the dotcom bubble the nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in march  shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed over the next two years many venture firms had been forced to writeoff large proportions of their investments and many funds were significant under water the values of the funds investments were below the amount of capital invested venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds and in numerous instances investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market by mid the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its  capacity nevertheless pricewaterhousecoopers moneytree survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at  levels through the second quarter of  although the postboom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in  they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from  through  as a percentage of gdp venture investment was  in  peaked at  nearly  times the  level in  and ranged from  to  in  and  the revival of an internetdriven environment in  through  helped to revive the venture capital environment however as a percentage of the overall private equity market venture capital has still not reached its mids level let alone its peak in  venture capital funds which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in  the height of the dotcom bubble raised only  billion in  a  decline from  and a significant decline from its peak funding obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business the return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business this return is generally earned when the venture capitalist exits by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in as a result firms are looking for the extremely rare yet soughtafter qualities such as innovative technology potential for rapid growth a welldeveloped business model and an impressive management team of these qualities funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame typically – years that venture capitalists expect because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an ipo stage when valuations are favourable venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the companys development idea generation startup ramp up and exit because there are no public exchanges listing their securities private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways including warm referrals from the investors trusted sources and other business contacts investor conferences and symposia and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in facetoface meetings including a variant known as speed venturing which is akin to speeddating for capital where the investor decides within  minutes whether he wants a followup meeting in addition some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors this need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies and most suitable for businesses having large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt that is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software and other intellectual property whose value is unproven in turn this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fastgrowing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields if a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan a good management team investment and passion from the founders a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle and target minimum returns in excess of  per year it will find it easier to raise venture capital financing stages there are typically six stages of venture round financing offered in venture capital that roughly correspond to these stages of a companys development seed funding the earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea often provided by angel investors equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding startup early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development growth series a round early sales and manufacturing funds this is typically where vcs come in series a can be thought of as the first institutional round subsequent investment rounds are called series b series c and so on this is where most companies will have the most growth secondround working capital for early stage companies that are selling product but not yet turning a profit this can also be called series b round and so on expansion also called mezzanine financing this is expansion money for a newly profitable company exit of venture capitalist vcs can exit through secondary sale or an ipo or an acquisition early stage vcs may exit in later rounds when new investors vcs or private equity investors buy the shares of existing investors sometimes a company very close to an ipo may allow some vcs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the ipo bridge financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full vc rounds the objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate between the first round and the fourth round venturebacked companies may also seek to take venture debt firms and funds venture capitalists a venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments a venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle in the united states often an lp or llc that primarily invests the financial capital of thirdparty investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans these funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds scientists researchers business training andor deep industry experience a core skill within vc is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage by definition vcs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage thus adding skills as well as capital thereby differentiating vc from buyout private equity which typically invest in companies with proven revenue and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of ones investment in a given startup company as a consequence most venture capital investments are done in a pool format where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies by investing in the pool format the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund structure venture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised venture capital firms in the united states may also be structured as limited liability companies in which case the firms managers are known as managing members investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners this constituency comprises both highnetworth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital such as state and private pension funds university financial endowments foundations insurance companies and pooled investment vehicles called funds of funds types venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations  and approaches there are multiple factors and each firm is different some of the factors that influence vc decisions include business situation some vcs tend to invest in new disruptive ideas or fledgling companies others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow some invest solely in certain industries some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally vc expectations can often vary some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth the amount of help a vc provides can vary from one firm to the next roles within the venture capital industry the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as venture capitalists or vcs typical career backgrounds vary but broadly speaking venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background venture capitalists with an operational background operating partner tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm other positions at venture capital firms include position role general partners or gps they run the venture capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund gps typically put in personal capital up to  of the vc fund size to show their commitment to the lps venture partners venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities bring in deals and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved principal this is a midlevel investment professional position and often considered a partnertrack position principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field such as investment banking management consulting or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm associate this is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm after a few successful years an associate may move up to the senior associate position and potentially principal and beyond associates will often have worked for – years in another field such as investment banking or management consulting entrepreneurinresidence entrepreneursinresidence eirs are experts in a particular industry sector eg biotechnology or social media and perform due diligence on potential deals eirs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily six to  months and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm although neither party is bound to work with each other some eirs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company structure of the funds most venture capital funds have a fixed life of  years with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity the investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years after which the focus is managing and making followon investments in an existing portfolio this model was pioneered by successful funds in silicon valley through the s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product in such a fund the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently called down by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments there are substantial penalties for a limited partner or investor that fails to participate in a capital call it can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund at the time when all of the money has been raised the fund is said to be closed and the year lifetime begins some funds have partial closes when one half or some other amount of the fund has been raised the vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify vc funds for comparison this shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them from investors point of view funds can be  traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms or  asymmetric—where different investors have different terms typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where theres an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors compensation main article carried interest venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest often referred to as a two and  arrangement payment implementation management fees an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the funds manager to pay for the private equity firms investment operations in a typical venture capital fund the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to  of the committed capital carried interest a share of the profits of the fund typically  paid to the private equity funds management company as a performance incentive the remaining  of the profits are paid to the funds investors strong limited partner interest in toptier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership and certain groups are able to command carried interest of – on their funds because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts by the time the fund cashes out an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending whom the general partners may not know well and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know alternatives because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur furthermore many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a startup company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology andor market potential for its product or services to achieve this or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven many startups seek to selffinance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors this practice is called bootstrapping equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations while such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding such as those listed at comparison of crowd funding services one of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional vc model the traditional vcs are shifting their focus to laterstage investments and return on investment of many vc funds have been low or negative in europe and india media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding media for equity investors are able to supply startups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity in europe an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding mergers and acquisition or other exit strategy in industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth good examples would include assetintensive extractive industries such as mining or manufacturing industries offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts which seek to utilise securitization in structuring hybrid multimarket transactions via an spv special purpose vehicle a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing in addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks groups have emerged which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it other forms include venture resources that seek to provide nonmonetary support to launch a new venture societal impact venture capital is also associated with job creation accounting for  of us gdp the knowledge economy and used as a proxy measure of innovation within an economic sector or geography every year there are nearly  million businesses created in the usa and – get venture capital funding according to the national venture capital association  of private sector jobs come from venturebacked companies and venturebacked revenue accounts for  of us gdp babson colleges diana report found that the number of women partners in vc firms decreased from  in  to  in  the report also found that  of vcfunded businesses had male chief executives and that businesses with allmale teams were more than four times as likely to receive vc funding compared to teams with at least one woman more than  of vc firms in the us did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed it was found that a greater fraction of vc firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies for comparison a uc davis study focusing on large public companies in california found  with at least one female board seat when the latter results were published some san jose mercury news readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause in a followup newsweek article nina burleigh asked where were all these offended people when women like heidi roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being

buyout and the venture capital bubble the s dotcom bubble to the credit crunch v t e venture capital vc is a type of private equity a form of financing that is provided by firms or funds to small earlystage emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees annual revenue or both venture capital firms or funds invest in these earlystage companies in exchange for equity or an ownership stake in the companies they invest in venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky startups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful the startups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries such as information technology it clean technology or biotechnology the typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial seed funding round the first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the series a round venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering ipo or doing a merger and acquisition also known as a trade sale of the company in addition to angel investing equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering in exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and earlystage companies venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions in addition to a significant portion of the companies ownership and consequently value startups like uber airbnb flipkart reviewadda xiaomi  didi chuxing are highly valued startups where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these earlystage firms they also often provide strategic advice to the firms executives on its business model and marketing strategies venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop this institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance technical expertise mentoring marketing knowhow and business models once integrated into the business network these firms are more likely to succeed as they become nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain however venture capitalists

defined as a project prospective converted into a process with an adequate assumed risk and investment with few exceptions private equity in the first half of the th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families the wallenbergs vanderbilts whitneys rockefellers and warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century in  laurance s rockefeller helped finance the creation of both eastern air lines and douglas aircraft and the rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies eric m warburg founded em warburg  co in  which would ultimately become warburg pincus with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital the wallenberg family started investor ab in  in sweden and were early investors in several swedish companies such as abb atlas copco ericsson etc in the first half of the th century origins of modern private equity before world war ii – money orders originally known as development capital remained primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families only after  did true private equity investments begin to emerge notably with the founding of the first two venture capital firms in  american research and development corporation ardc and jh whitney  company georges doriot the father of venture capitalism and former assistant dean of harvard business school founded insead in  along with ralph flanders and karl compton former president of mit doriot founded ardc in  to encourage privatesector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from world war ii ardc became the first institutional privateequity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well ardc is creditedby whom with the first trick when its  investment of  in digital equipment corporation dec would be valued at over  million after the companys initial public offering in  representing a return of over  times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of  former employees of ardc went on to establish several prominent venturecapital firms including greylock partners founded in  by charlie waite and bill elfers and morgan holland ventures the predecessor of flagship ventures founded in  by james morgan ardc continued investing until  when doriot retired in  doriot merged ardc with textron after having invested in over  companies john hay whitney – and his partner benno schmidt – founded jh whitney  company in  whitney had been investing since the s founding pioneer pictures in  and acquiring a  interest in technicolor corporation with his cousin cornelius vanderbilt whitney florida foods corporation proved whitneys most famous investment the company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to american soldiers later known as minute maid orange juice and was sold to the cocacola company in  jh whitney  company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised  million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in  early venture capital and the growth of silicon valley a highway exit for sand hill road in menlo park california where many bay area venture capital firms are based one of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the small business investment act of  the  act officially allowed the us small business administration sba to license private small business investment companies sbics to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the united states during the s putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to compete the transaction it was a business that was growing very rapidly and as the business grew the transactions grew exponentially during the s and s venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies more often than not these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic medical or dataprocessing technology as a result venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance an early west coast venture capital company was draper and johnson investment company formed in  by william henry draper iii and franklin p johnson jr in  sutter hill ventures acquired the portfolio of draper and johnson as a founding action bill draper and paul wythes were the founders and pitch johnson formed asset management company at that time it is commonly noted that the first venturebacked startup is fairchild semiconductor which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit funded in  by what would later become venrock associates venrock was founded in  by laurance s rockefeller the fourth of john d rockefellers six children as a way to allow other rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments it was also in the s that the common form of private equity fund still in use today emerged private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors who were passive limited partners put up the capital the compensation structure still in use today also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of – and a carried interest typically representing up to  of the profits of the partnership the growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on sand hill road beginning with kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital in  located in menlo park ca kleiner perkins sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the santa clara valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies throughout the s a group of private equity firms focused primarily on venture capital investments would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms in  with the number of new venture capital firms increasing leading venture capitalists formed the national venture capital association nvca the nvca was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in  when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund it was not until  that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year as the industry raised approximately  million with the passage of the employee retirement income security act erisa in  corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies in  the us labor department relaxed certain of the erisa restrictions under the prudent man rule thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists s the public successes of the venture capital industry in the s and early s eg digital equipment corporation apple inc genentech gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms from just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade there were over  firms by the end of the s each searching for the next major home run the number of firms multiplied and the capital managed by these firms increased from  billion to  billion over the course of the decade the growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time in addition to the increased competition among firms several other factors affected returns the market for initial public offerings cooled in the mids before collapsing after the stock market crash in  and foreign corporations particularly from japan and korea flooded earlystage companies with capital in response to the changing conditions corporations that had sponsored inhouse venture investment arms including general electric and paine webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units additionally venture capital units within chemical bank and continental illinois national bank among others began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies even industry founders jh whitney  company and warburg pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments venture capital boom and the internet bubble by the end of the s venture capital returns were relatively low particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins due in part to the competition for hot startups excess supply of ipos and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the s and the first half of the s increasing from  billion in  to just over  billion more than a decade later in  after a shakeout of venture capital managers the more successful firms retrenched focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments results would begin to turn very attractive successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the s yale school of management professor andrew metrick refers to these first  years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in  as the preboom period in anticipation of the boom that would begin in  and last through the bursting of the internet bubble in  the late s were a boom time for venture capital as firms on sand hill road in menlo park and silicon valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent internet and other computer technologies initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance and venture firms were reaping large returns private equity crash the technologyheavy nasdaq composite index peaked at  in march  reflecting the high point of the dotcom bubble the nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in march  shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed over the next two years many venture firms had been forced to writeoff large proportions of their investments and many funds were significant under water the values of the funds investments were below the amount of capital invested venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds and in numerous instances investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market by mid the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its  capacity nevertheless pricewaterhousecoopers moneytree survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at  levels through the second quarter of  although the postboom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in  they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from  through  as a percentage of gdp venture investment was  in  peaked at  nearly  times the  level in  and ranged from  to  in  and  the revival of an internetdriven environment in  through  helped to revive the venture capital environment however as a percentage of the overall private equity market venture capital has still not reached its mids level let alone its peak in  venture capital funds which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in  the height of the dotcom bubble raised only  billion in  a  decline from  and a significant decline from its peak funding obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business the return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business this return is generally earned when the venture capitalist exits by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in as a result firms are looking for the extremely rare yet soughtafter qualities such as innovative technology potential for rapid growth a welldeveloped business model and an impressive management team of these qualities funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame typically – years that venture capitalists expect because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an ipo stage when valuations are favourable venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the companys development idea generation startup ramp up and exit because there are no public exchanges listing their securities private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways including warm referrals from the investors trusted sources and other business contacts investor conferences and symposia and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in facetoface meetings including a variant known as speed venturing which is akin to speeddating for capital where the investor decides within  minutes whether he wants a followup meeting in addition some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors this need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies and most suitable for businesses having large upfront capital requirements which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt that is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software and other intellectual property whose value is unproven in turn this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fastgrowing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields if a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan a good management team investment and passion from the founders a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle and target minimum returns in excess of  per year it will find it easier to raise venture capital financing stages there are typically six stages of venture round financing offered in venture capital that roughly correspond to these stages of a companys development seed funding the earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea often provided by angel investors equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding startup early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development growth series a round early sales and manufacturing funds this is typically where vcs come in series a can be thought of as the first institutional round subsequent investment rounds are called series b series c and so on this is where most companies will have the most growth secondround working capital for early stage companies that are selling product but not yet turning a profit this can also be called series b round and so on expansion also called mezzanine financing this is expansion money for a newly profitable company exit of venture capitalist vcs can exit through secondary sale or an ipo or an acquisition early stage vcs may exit in later rounds when new investors vcs or private equity investors buy the shares of existing investors sometimes a company very close to an ipo may allow some vcs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the ipo bridge financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full vc rounds the objective is to raise smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate between the first round and the fourth round venturebacked companies may also seek to take venture debt firms and funds venture capitalists a venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments a venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle in the united states often an lp or llc that primarily invests the financial capital of thirdparty investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans these funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds scientists researchers business training andor deep industry experience a core skill within vc is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage by definition vcs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage thus adding skills as well as capital thereby differentiating vc from buyout private equity which typically invest in companies with proven revenue and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of ones investment in a given startup company as a consequence most venture capital investments are done in a pool format where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies by investing in the pool format the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund structure venture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised venture capital firms in the united states may also be structured as limited liability companies in which case the firms managers are known as managing members investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners this constituency comprises both highnetworth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital such as state and private pension funds university financial endowments foundations insurance companies and pooled investment vehicles called funds of funds types venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations  and approaches there are multiple factors and each firm is different some of the factors that influence vc decisions include business situation some vcs tend to invest in new disruptive ideas or fledgling companies others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow some invest solely in certain industries some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally vc expectations can often vary some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth the amount of help a vc provides can vary from one firm to the next roles within the venture capital industry the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as venture capitalists or vcs typical career backgrounds vary but broadly speaking venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background venture capitalists with an operational background operating partner tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm other positions at venture capital firms include position role general partners or gps they run the venture capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund gps typically put in personal capital up to  of the vc fund size to show their commitment to the lps venture partners venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities bring in deals and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved principal this is a midlevel investment professional position and often considered a partnertrack position principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field such as investment banking management consulting or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm associate this is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm after a few successful years an associate may move up to the senior associate position and potentially principal and beyond associates will often have worked for – years in another field such as investment banking or management consulting entrepreneurinresidence entrepreneursinresidence eirs are experts in a particular industry sector eg biotechnology or social media and perform due diligence on potential deals eirs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily six to  months and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm although neither party is bound to work with each other some eirs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company structure of the funds most venture capital funds have a fixed life of  years with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity the investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years after which the focus is managing and making followon investments in an existing portfolio this model was pioneered by successful funds in silicon valley through the s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product in such a fund the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently called down by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments there are substantial penalties for a limited partner or investor that fails to participate in a capital call it can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund at the time when all of the money has been raised the fund is said to be closed and the year lifetime begins some funds have partial closes when one half or some other amount of the fund has been raised the vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify vc funds for comparison this shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them from investors point of view funds can be  traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms or  asymmetric—where different investors have different terms typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where theres an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors compensation main article carried interest venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest often referred to as a two and  arrangement payment implementation management fees an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the funds manager to pay for the private equity firms investment operations in a typical venture capital fund the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to  of the committed capital carried interest a share of the profits of the fund typically  paid to the private equity funds management company as a performance incentive the remaining  of the profits are paid to the funds investors strong limited partner interest in toptier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership and certain groups are able to command carried interest of – on their funds because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts by the time the fund cashes out an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending whom the general partners may not know well and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know alternatives because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur furthermore many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a startup company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology andor market potential for its product or services to achieve this or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven many startups seek to selffinance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors this practice is called bootstrapping equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations while such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding such as those listed at comparison of crowd funding services one of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional vc model the traditional vcs are shifting their focus to laterstage investments and return on investment of many vc funds have been low or negative in europe and india media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding media for equity investors are able to supply startups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity in europe an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding mergers and acquisition or other exit strategy in industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth good examples would include assetintensive extractive industries such as mining or manufacturing industries offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts which seek to utilise securitization in structuring hybrid multimarket transactions via an spv special purpose vehicle a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing in addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks groups have emerged which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it other forms include venture resources that seek to provide nonmonetary support to launch a new venture societal impact venture capital is also associated with job creation accounting for  of us gdp the knowledge economy and used as a proxy measure of innovation within an economic sector or geography every year there are nearly  million businesses created in the usa and – get venture capital funding according to the national venture capital association  of private sector jobs come from venturebacked companies and venturebacked revenue accounts for  of us gdp babson colleges diana report found that the number of women partners in vc firms decreased from  in  to  in  the report also found that  of vcfunded businesses had male chief executives and that businesses with allmale teams were more than four times as likely to receive vc funding compared to teams with at least one woman more than  of vc firms in the us did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed it was found that a greater fraction of vc firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies for comparison a uc davis study focusing on large public companies in california found  with at least one female board seat when the latter results were published some san jose mercury news readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause in a followup newsweek article nina burleigh asked where were all these offended people when women like heidi roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed geographical differences venture capital as an industry originated in the united states and american firms have traditionally been the largest participants in venture deals with the bulk of venture capital being deployed in american companies however increasingly nonus venture investment is growing and the number and size of nonus venture capitalists have been expanding venture capital
