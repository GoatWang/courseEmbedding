industry was announced on august   as an arm of the usbased multinational corporation monsanto in february  memc started production of mm silicon ingots at its location in st peters missouri  miles west of monsantos headquarters in st louis as one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers memc was a pioneer in the field and some of its innovations became industry standards into the st century memc used the czochralski process cz process of silicon crystal production and developed the chemical mechanical polishing cmp process of wafer finishing in  memc installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers and developed zerodislocation crystal growing which made largediameter silicon crystals possible expansionedit in the early s memc opened a production plant in kuala lumpur malaysia and sent its st peters–produced inch ingots there for slicing and polishing in  memc became the first company to manufacture mm inch wafers in  the first to produce mm inch wafers and in partnership with ibm in  the first to produce mm inch wafers in  memc opened its production and rd facility in utsunomiya japan to serve the japanese semiconductor market becoming the first nonjapanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in japan change of ownershipedit memc experienced heavy pricepressure from japanese competition during the mid s despite its success and increasing revenues memc had to account for losses for a few years leading to the decision of monsanto which was refocusing on chemicals agriculture and biotechnology products to sell the electronic materials division in  the german company hüls ag the chemicals arm of the german conglomerate veba acquired monsanto electronic materials and combined it with hüls previous acquisition dynamite nobel silicon dns to form memc electronic materials dns already operated silicon wafer plants in merano and novara italy and integrated them within the new memc electronic materials hüls supported the new subsidiary with  million for research and development and for manufacturing expansion in  memc developed the first process using granular polysilicon which provided cost and productivity advantages over chunk polysilicon four years later memc acquired albemarle corporations granular polysilicon production facility in pasadena texas which had been producing granular

external links historyedit foundationedit the establishment of monsanto electronic materials company memc a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry was announced on august   as an arm of the usbased multinational corporation monsanto in february  memc started production of mm silicon ingots at its location in st peters missouri  miles west of monsantos headquarters in st louis as one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers memc was a pioneer in the field and some of its innovations became industry standards into the st century memc used the czochralski process cz process of silicon crystal production and developed the chemical mechanical polishing cmp process of wafer finishing in  memc installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers and developed zerodislocation crystal growing which made largediameter silicon crystals possible expansionedit in the early s memc opened a production plant in kuala lumpur malaysia and sent its st peters–produced inch ingots there for slicing and polishing in  memc became the first company to manufacture mm inch wafers in  the first to produce mm inch wafers and in partnership with ibm in  the first to produce mm inch wafers in  memc opened its production and rd facility in utsunomiya japan to serve the japanese semiconductor market becoming the first nonjapanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in japan change of ownershipedit memc experienced heavy pricepressure from japanese competition during the mid s despite its success and increasing revenues memc had to account for losses for a few years leading to the decision of monsanto which was refocusing on chemicals agriculture and biotechnology products to sell the electronic materials division in  the german company hüls ag the chemicals arm of the german conglomerate veba acquired monsanto electronic materials and combined it with hüls previous acquisition dynamite nobel silicon dns to form memc electronic materials dns already operated silicon wafer plants in merano and novara italy and integrated them within the new memc electronic materials hüls supported the new subsidiary with  million for research and development and for manufacturing expansion in  memc developed the first process using granular polysilicon which provided cost and productivity advantages over chunk polysilicon four years later memc acquired albemarle corporations granular polysilicon production facility in pasadena texas which had been producing granular polysilicon since  memcs stock began trading on the new york stock exchange with an initial public offering in  the ipo raised over  million which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company and hülsveba retained a majority interest in the company the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late s hit memc hard in  the company reported a loss of  million on revenues of  million in june  veba ag still holding  of memc was merged with viag to form the new eon ag eon wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities and

long there is only so much of it the sun there is no limit so solar seems obvious to me”   frankly we couldn’t have said it better ourselves that’s why at sunedison we’re working to bring solar energy to farmers and entrepreneurs all over the world     share peace of mind indian farmer believes in the power of solar rural electrification it’s one of the surprising benefits of bringing electricity

newlife to triedandtrue methods of renewable energy  view story  wind prices fell to  centskwh in   reduction in cost of wind energy wind power change is in the air thanks to significant declines in the cost of wind energy recent advances in design mean that today’s wind turbines are converting a higher amount of wind into wind energy and that has reduced the cost of wind energy by an impressive  percent since    this has led to significant growth in wind capacity across america and the world for example fully onequarter of all new electricgenerating capacity added in the us in  came from wind power bringing the nation’s total installed wind capacity to almost  gw that’s enough energy to power over  million homes   at sunedison we’re doing our part to lead this important shift to clean affordable renewable energy not just in the us but also around the world the world of energy is on the cusp of major change people everywhere are seeking an alternative to conventional fossil fuels our commitment to solar and wind energy means we are ready to meet those changing needs whichever way the wind blows us department of energy august  wind technologies market report highlight share go

new technology wind power for thousands of years human ingenuity has created technologies to harness the power of the wind but to meet the growing energy needs of a rapidly expanding global population traditional methods need a little boost from modern technology   at sunedison we’re committed to bringing the latest technology to the world of renewable energy that’s why our wind farms utilize the most advanced turbines capable of transforming even a light breeze into clean electricity   the old windmill pictured here stands only a little ways away from one of our wind farms the  mw project near milford utah and it serves as a reminder that sometimes the simplest ideas are the best share  years of community spirit our community solar projects are giving people a new reason to come together  view story   million in utility bill savings see how we’re helping residents in massachusetts get the affordable electricity they need  view story  “today’s solar panels are  more powerful than those made just  years ago”  dave ranhoff svp sunedison solar materials  decrease in solar panel costs since  clean energy on a grand scale  homes in arizona are feeling the benefits of solar and it doesn’t stop there  view story  clean energy on a grand scale solar solutions this  mw utilityscale solar project built by sunedison sits in the sprawling sundrenched avra valley northwest of tucson arizona it generates enough clean energy to power  homes and will do so for decades to come and each year that it operates it will save approximately  million gallons of water that would otherwise have been needed for fossil fuel generated electricity in addition the co reductions achieved by the avra valley project are equivalent to taking over  cars off the road   this is only one of dozens of utility scale projects sunedison has built or operates around the world which together generate over  gigawatts of energy share  years of community spirit solar solutions in the early s when the pilgrims settled the town of bourne massachusetts they were looking to create a community of likeminded individuals today that spirit of community is alive and well its latest expression can be found in the town’s innovative “community solar” project part of a growing trend toward shared renewable energy   rather than installing individual solar systems on homes and businesses a larger system is built people in the community can own or lease a portion of the system similar to a community garden where individuals work a plot of land in a larger garden not only are larger systems highly cost effective community solar enables those who might not otherwise be able to enjoy the benefits of solar to do so – for example apartment dwellers renters or people whose homes don’t get enough sunlight   sunedison is proud to have partnered with the residents of bourne to develop this pioneering approach to solar energy and to do so in the same spirit of community that the pilgrims would have recognized share  million in utility bill savings solar solutions affordable housing demands affordable energy that’s why  public housing authorities across massachusetts have partnered with sunedison to purchase solar energy solutions that will deliver an estimated  million in savings over the next  years   but the benefits are not just economic co emissions will be reduced by  million tons  that’s equivalent to taking some  cars off the road   all of which means the citizens of massachusetts can breathe a whole lot easier knowing that public housing energy costs will be stable and predictable for decades to come thanks to clean and reliable solar energy share technology ahead of its time ultrapure silicon ingot producedusing  less energy science and magic  pure silicon from our proprietary process when catching the windbigger is better new wind turbines are reaching up  view story  advanced polysilicon technologyat the lowest cost the next generation of solar technology  view story  “i find out what the worldneeds then i go aheadand try to invent it”  thomas edison crystalline silicon zero white space higher efficiency by eliminating unused space between cells wecan deliver sleeker more powerful solar panels  view story  zero white space higher efficiency transformative technology when it comes to solar panel efficiency every square millimeter counts that’s why sunedison has developed a zero white space zws high efficiency solar module by eliminating the unused areas between solar cells we’ve boosted each panel’s power output by up to    a solar panel that used to produce  watts of peak energy can now produce  and greater output means greater efficiency the result is that this new technology can reduce total system cost by up to    not only is zws technology smart and efficient it looks good too it turns out that eliminating the unnecessary white space results in a sleek seamless black surface perfect for integrating into residential roofs who knew share advanced polysilicon technology at the lowest cost transformative technology solar energy is at a tipping point it’s well on its way to becoming the lowest cost energy solution—not just in comparison to other renewables but the cost winner over fossil fuels as well   at sunedison we’re working to bring about this change by developing leading edge technology that will produce the lowest cost polysilicon in the world polysilicon is the basic building block of solar cells and with this stepchange in technology we’re well on the way to producing a  watt solar panel at a cost of  per watt   our proprietary technology now in operation at our joint venture facility in ulsan korea produces ultra pure polysilicon  times more efficiently than conventional technologies using  less energy lowcost clean solar energy will transform the way all of us use energy and it has the power to transform our planet as well share when catching the wind bigger is better transformative technology wind turbine technology is climbing to new heights—quite literally the average power output of newly installed wind turbines in the us has risen  in the past  years   this increased power output has been achieved in part by building up the average hub height of new turbines has grown by almost  now reaching over  feet at the same time the average rotor diameter has more than doubled add it all up and wind turbine blades are reaching higher than ever before   and if you’ve ever climbed to the top of a tall peak you’ll know the winds get stronger the higher you go  for wind turbines this means the taller they are the more wind there is to capture and transform into clean renewable energy us department of energy august  wind technologies market report highlights share “the best way to predictthe future is to design it”  buckminister fuller the future is now our world is changing and with it comes new ways of obtaining the energy we needto power our lives  view story  growing together great pay plenty of jobs—renewable energyneeds skilled workers and we’re making surethe industry gets them  view story  from net zero to infinity the possibilities are endless when youcombine the power of the sun and oneof our innovative solar solutions  view story  from  to  megawattsin  months when chile needed a solution to their growingenergy concerns we leapt into action  view story  energy storage costsare falling rapidly from net zero to infinity the future of energy “net zero” refers to homes that generate as much energy as they consume and the energy they generate typically comes from clean solar power that means the amount of energy they need to draw from conventional sources is exactly zero   sunedison’s patented hybrid solar system has allowed users to transform their homes into selfsufficient net zero buildings our system not only generates electricity but also provides solar water heating solar home heating and solar home cooling – all under one roof   this is only one of many innovative systems we’re developing to take advantage of the virtually infinite power of the sun in the future more and more homes will be net zero freeing homeowners from their dependence on centralized power and from the uncertainties of energy pricing share the future is now the future of energy the world of solar energy has reached a remarkable moment of transformation thanks to three converging trends first costs have plummeted and we can confidently predict they will fall even further in the future we believe that solar will soon become the most cost effective way to produce electricity in fact in some parts of the world it already is   secondly the performance of solar panels has risen dramatically – up by  in just the last  years and finally the ability to store the energy produced by solar systems is improving every day thanks to innovations driven by the automotive industry and electric cars   taken together these changes mean that soon more of us will be using the abundant power of the sun to run our homes and our cars it gives a whole new meaning to the idea that the world revolves around the sun share growing together the future of energy solar energy is rapidly growing to satisfy more and more of our energy needs and as the industry grows so is the demand for skilled workers that’s why sunedison and grid alternatives have launched a us based initiative called rise to train new workers and ensure a more inclusive workforce   this initiative provides training for women and those in underserved communities but the benefits don’t stop there in addition to providing handson training this program also makes solar accessible to lowincome families allowing them to lower their energy costs   as our industry grows our hope is that everyone will rise with it especially those who need a little extra help share from  to  megawatts in  months the future of energy as the demand for solar energy grows so does the need for rapid deployment at sunedison we take special pride in being able to bring largescale solar projects online quickly and efficiently   consider our amanecer solar cap plant located in the atacama desert in chile this sprawling project consists of  solar photovoltaic “pv” panels spread over  acres and generates  mw of power it took less than  months to build by way of comparison the average coalfired plant would take  years or more to construct   as the pace at which we transform our energy supply to renewable resources speeds up increasingly the race will go to the swift and at sunedison we aim to be at the head of the pack share south africa solve this puzzle  view story  solar down under we’ve installed over   solar systemson homes schools and commercialbusinesses across australia middle east sees a futurerich in solar even this oilcentric region is looking tothe sun for longterm prosperity  view story  the world owes nothing to any man but

inc is looking to the sky to help relieve high energy costs  view story  india working towards  gigawattsof solar power  view story  malaysian airports look to the sky global impact it was natural that when malaysian airports needed a way to relieve costly energy bills they turned to the sky or rather the sun and with some creative engineering from sunedison the country’s first airport solar system was created at kuala lumpur international airport   it was no easy task with much of the available land dedicated to parking there was little room for a solar system   a solar parking canopy which uses solar panels to create covered parking turned out to be the perfect solution today visitors to the airport can park their car in the shade of a canopy that is silently making reliable economical solar energy now that’s what we call practical innovation share middle east sees a future rich in solar global impact when you think about oil and fossil fuels the middle east probably comes to mind but now even this oilcentric region is looking to sunedison and a solar future   in jordan we’re constructing a  mw solar power plant that will sell electricity to the jordanian national electric power company nepco and in saudi arabia where they’ve announced their intention to become a world leader in solar energy we’re making our advanced silicon technology available to help make this happen   at a conference in may  the saudi oil minister shared his vision for the future he said that one day “…instead of exporting fossil fuels we will be exporting gigawatts of solar electric power”   wow solar power is indeed transforming the world of energy share south africa global impact how do you provide a rapidly growing population with affordable energy when you have an antiquated and unreliable power system you turn to sunedison and solar power   our solar power plants generate energy that is cost competitive with fossil fuels we can bring a new utility scale solar power plant online in under six months whereas a conventional fossil fuel fired power plant typically takes years to build and as an added benefit our solar power plants are strategically located to strengthen the utility grid making the entire system more reliable   with  mw of solar power operational or planned in south africa we’re set to generate enough clean energy to power an estimated  homes and we’re just getting started share india global impact in july  we signed an agreement with tata power delhi distribution limited one of the largest utilities in india to provide  megawatts of solar power to the people of new delhi that’s enough solar to power over  indian homes   “good things happen when you bring two of india’s largest energy brands together” said pashupathy gopalan sunedison president of asiapacific and subsahara africa “the people of new delhi will benefit from clean reliable and affordable energy as a result of this project which makes a direct and powerful contribution towards india’s goal of generating  gigawatts of solar power by ”   agreed share rural electrification wind power solar solutions transformative technology the future of energy global impact we’re

centskwh in   reduction in cost of wind energy wind power change is in the air thanks to significant declines in the cost of wind energy recent advances in design mean that today’s wind turbines are converting a higher amount of wind into wind energy and that has reduced the cost of wind energy by an impressive  percent since    this has led to significant growth in wind capacity across america and the world for example fully onequarter of all new electricgenerating capacity added in the us in  came from wind power bringing the nation’s total installed wind capacity to almost  gw that’s enough energy to power over  million homes   at sunedison we’re doing our part to lead this important shift to clean affordable renewable energy not just in the us but also around the world the world of energy is on the cusp of major change people everywhere are seeking an alternative to conventional fossil fuels our commitment to solar and wind energy means we are ready to meet those changing needs whichever way the wind blows us department of energy august  wind technologies market report highlight share go big and stay home wind power in the sprawling deserts of utah you will find the state’s largest wind farm sunedison’s milford wind project generates a staggering  mw of clean power since its completion in  this facility has generated close to  million megawatt hours of clean renewable electricity to produce the same amount of energy a coalfired plant would have had to burn  million tons of coal   pictured here is sunedison project manager bill dent who is about to scale the inside of one of the foottall turbines there are  of them onsite that’s why bill and his team of almost  fulltime employees have made milford and the surrounding area their home that way with the help of sunedison’s remote operations centers they can monitor and maintain the facility  hours a day all year round   because when you build something big enough to supply energy for  homes right in your own backyard you want to make sure it keeps working just the way it was designed to share old ideas new technology wind power for thousands of years human ingenuity has created technologies to harness the power of the wind but to meet the growing energy needs of a rapidly expanding global population traditional methods need a little boost from modern technology   at sunedison we’re committed to bringing the latest technology to the world of renewable energy that’s why our wind farms utilize the most advanced turbines capable of transforming even a light breeze into clean

mw utilityscale solar project built by sunedison sits in the sprawling sundrenched avra valley northwest of tucson arizona it generates enough clean energy to power  homes and will do so for decades to come and each year that it operates it will save approximately  million gallons of water that would otherwise have been needed for fossil fuel generated electricity in addition the co reductions achieved by the avra valley project are equivalent to taking over  cars off the road   this is only one of dozens of utility scale projects sunedison has built or operates around the world which together generate over  gigawatts of energy share  years of community spirit solar solutions in the early s when the pilgrims settled the town of bourne massachusetts they were looking to create a community of likeminded individuals today that spirit of community is alive and well its latest expression can be found in the town’s innovative “community solar” project part of a growing trend toward shared renewable energy   rather than installing individual solar systems on homes and businesses a larger system is built people in the community can own or lease a portion of the system similar to a community garden where individuals work a plot of land in a larger garden not only are larger systems highly cost effective community solar enables those who might not otherwise be able to enjoy the benefits of solar to do so – for example apartment dwellers renters or people whose homes don’t get enough sunlight   sunedison is proud to have partnered with the residents of bourne to develop this pioneering approach to solar energy and to do so in the same spirit of community that the pilgrims would have recognized share  million in utility bill savings solar solutions affordable housing demands affordable energy that’s why  public housing authorities across massachusetts have partnered with sunedison to purchase solar energy solutions that will deliver an estimated  million in savings over the next  years   but the benefits are not just economic co emissions will be reduced by  million tons  that’s equivalent to taking some  cars off the road   all of which means the citizens of massachusetts can breathe a whole lot easier knowing that public housing energy costs will be stable and predictable for decades to come thanks to clean and reliable solar energy share

technology solar energy is at a tipping point it’s well on its way to becoming the lowest cost energy solution—not just in comparison to other renewables but the cost winner over fossil fuels as well   at sunedison we’re working to bring about this change by developing leading edge technology that will produce the lowest cost polysilicon in the world polysilicon is the basic building block of solar cells and with this stepchange in technology we’re well on the way to producing a  watt solar panel at a cost of  per watt   our proprietary technology now in operation at our joint venture facility in ulsan korea produces ultra pure polysilicon  times more efficiently than conventional technologies using  less energy lowcost clean solar energy will transform the way all of us use energy and it has the power to transform our planet as well share when catching the wind bigger is better transformative technology wind turbine technology is climbing to new heights—quite literally the average power output of newly installed wind turbines in the us has risen  in the past  years   this increased power output has been achieved in part by building up the average hub height of new turbines has grown by almost  now reaching over  feet at the same time the average rotor diameter has more than doubled add it all up and wind turbine blades are reaching higher than ever before   and if you’ve ever climbed to the top of a tall peak you’ll know the winds get stronger the higher you go  for wind turbines this means the taller they are the more wind there is to capture and transform

future of energy “net zero” refers to homes that generate as much energy as they consume and the energy they generate typically comes from clean solar power that means the amount of energy they need to draw from conventional sources is exactly zero   sunedison’s patented hybrid solar system has allowed users to transform their homes into selfsufficient net zero buildings our system not only generates electricity but also provides solar water heating solar home heating and solar home cooling – all under one roof   this is only one of many innovative systems we’re developing to take advantage of the virtually infinite power of the sun in the future more and more homes will be net zero freeing homeowners from their dependence on centralized power and from the uncertainties of energy pricing share the future is now the future of energy the world of solar energy has reached a remarkable moment of transformation thanks to three converging trends first costs have plummeted and we can confidently predict they will fall even further in the future we believe that solar will soon become the most cost effective way to produce electricity in fact in some parts of the world it already is   secondly the performance of solar panels has risen dramatically – up by  in just the last  years and finally the ability to store the energy produced by solar systems is improving every day thanks to innovations driven by the automotive industry and electric cars   taken together these changes mean that soon more of us will be using the abundant power of the sun to run our homes and our cars it gives a whole new meaning to the idea that the world revolves around the sun share growing together the future of energy solar energy is rapidly growing to satisfy more and more of our energy needs and as the industry grows so is the demand for skilled workers that’s why sunedison and grid alternatives have launched a us based initiative called rise to train new workers and ensure a more inclusive workforce   this initiative provides training for women and those in underserved communities but the benefits don’t stop there in addition to providing handson training this program also makes solar accessible to lowincome families allowing them to lower their energy costs   as our industry grows our hope is that everyone will rise with it especially those who need a little extra help share from  to  megawatts in  months the future of energy as the demand for solar energy grows so does the need for rapid deployment at sunedison we take special pride in being able to bring largescale solar projects online quickly and efficiently   consider our amanecer solar cap plant located in the atacama desert in chile this sprawling project consists of  solar photovoltaic “pv” panels spread over  acres and generates  mw of power it took less than  months to build by way of comparison the average coalfired plant would take  years or more to construct   as the pace at which we transform our energy supply to renewable resources speeds up increasingly the race will go to the swift and at sunedison we aim to be at the head of the pack share south africa solve this puzzle

rather the sun and with some creative engineering from sunedison the country’s first airport solar system was created at kuala lumpur international airport   it was no easy task with much of the available land dedicated to parking there was little room for a solar system   a solar parking canopy which uses solar panels to create covered parking turned out to be the perfect solution today visitors to the airport can park their car in the shade of a canopy that is silently making reliable economical solar energy now that’s what we call practical innovation share middle east sees a future rich in solar global impact when you think about oil and fossil fuels the middle east probably comes to mind but now even this oilcentric region is looking to sunedison and a solar future   in jordan we’re constructing a  mw solar power plant that will sell electricity to the jordanian national electric power company nepco and in saudi arabia where they’ve announced their intention to become a world leader in solar energy we’re making our advanced silicon technology available to help make this happen   at a conference in may  the saudi oil minister shared his vision for the future

facility in korea solar materials the story of solar electricity from photovoltaics pv is a journey from sand to sun to electricity at each stage of this journey both science and magic happens at sunedison we have been working for over  years to perfect the science and multiply the magic from sand to sun to electricity sand lets begin with the sand or to be more precise the silicon in the sand silicon is the basis for most semiconductors whether theyre used in computer chips or solar panels neither industry would exist without this essential element silicon in order to be useful silicon must be extracted from the sand and purified conventional techniques consume massive amounts of energy and potentially introduce impurities into the silicon so we invented a better way ultrapure silicon produced in a better way fluidized bed reactor technology fluidized bed reactor or fbr technology produces ultrapure silicon more efficiently and economically than conventional techniques during the fbr process very small particles of silicon called seeds are suspended in a cloud of gas silicon in the gas attaches to the seeds forming larger and larger beads which eventually drop out of the gas like rain  silicon rain fbr technology creates silicon  pure and ultrapure silicon enables more powerful more efficient solar cells but we didnt stop there our latest innovation high pressure fluidized bed reactor technology produces pure silicon  times more efficiently and with  less energy used than competing technologies more efficient ingot manufactured in a better way the continuous czochralski process isolating and purifying the silicon is just the first step in the journey toward making solar cells and ultimately solar panels we next have to turn the beads of purified silicon into microthin square slices of pure silicon called wafers below you can see ultrapure silicon beads that have been added to a molten batch of silicon used in the continuous czochralski process ccz process first we melt the silicon and add different elements to it a process called doping most solar cells are made from ptype silicon which typically has been doped with the element boron during the manufacturing process ptype silicon doesnt produce the optimal solar cell but conventional processes have difficulty using other dopants so ptype silicon it is for most manufacturers not sunedison our proprietary continuous czochralski or ccz process enables the creation of ntype silicon doped with the element phosphorus and solar cells made with ntype silicon typically deliver  to  greater power and energy than conventional ptype solar cells the next step is to create an ingot of solid purified silicon that can be sliced into the microthin wafers needed for solar cells we form the ingot out of a single crystal drawn from the pool of molten silicon this results in a perfect crystalline structure where all the atoms are precisely aligned for higher efficiency sunedisons ccz process produces these ingots more efficiently and cost effectively than any other technology the perfect solar material the final product is the result of decades of sunedison knowhow and innovation it is the perfect solar material ready to be neatly made into solar cells that better harness the power of the sun solar modules the following solar material resources

emerging electronics industry was announced on august   as an arm of the usbased multinational corporation monsanto in february  memc started production of mm silicon ingots at its location in st peters missouri  miles west of monsantos headquarters in st louis as one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers memc was a pioneer in the field and some of its innovations became industry standards into the st century memc used the czochralski process cz process of silicon crystal production and developed the chemical mechanical polishing cmp process of wafer finishing in  memc installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers and developed zerodislocation crystal growing which made largediameter silicon crystals possible expansionedit in the early s memc opened a production plant in kuala lumpur malaysia and sent its st peters–produced inch ingots there for slicing and polishing in  memc became the first company to manufacture mm inch wafers in  the first to produce mm inch wafers and in partnership with ibm in  the first to produce mm inch wafers in  memc opened its production and rd facility in utsunomiya japan to serve the japanese semiconductor market becoming the first nonjapanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in japan change of ownershipedit memc experienced heavy pricepressure from japanese competition during the mid s despite its success and increasing revenues memc had to account for losses for a few years leading to the decision of monsanto which was refocusing on chemicals agriculture and biotechnology products to sell the electronic materials division in  the german company hüls ag the chemicals arm of the german conglomerate veba acquired monsanto electronic materials and combined it with hüls previous acquisition dynamite nobel silicon dns to form memc electronic materials dns already operated silicon wafer plants in merano and novara italy and integrated them within the new memc electronic materials hüls supported the new subsidiary with  million for research and development and for manufacturing expansion in  memc developed the first process using
