marcato capital management calls for leadership change at bank of new york releases letter and presentation advocating for a better bank of new york mar    et from marcato capital management lp san francisco march   prnewswire  marcato capital management lp marcato a san franciscobased investment manager that beneficially owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of the bank of new york mellon corporation nyse bk today released its analysis of the company and its conclusion that meaningful leadership change needs to take place in order to create significant longterm shareholder value the letter and presentation can be viewed at wwwabetterbankofnewyorkcom marcato is one of bks largest investors and encourages all of its fellow shareholders to review the letter and presentation carefully and if they find the content compelling to reach out to the board and voice their support for leadership change a full text of the letter follows march   wesley w von schack the bank of new york mellon corporation church street station po box  new york new york  attn nonmanagement director wes as you know funds managed by marcato have been sizeable shareholders of bank of new york mellon for much of the past year  in that time we have had the opportunity to discuss the company and its prospects with senior management members of the board of directors numerous large shareholders and prominent research analysts  having had a number of these discussions over the past six months we are writing today because we have serious concerns that members of the board and management do not share the sense of frustration and desire for change that is felt by many shareholders including ourselves  we believe that meaningful improvement will not occur without meaningful change in leadership and that starts with the ceo bank of new york mellon is simply not achieving its potential  this is most easily observed by the persistent failure to achieve longrange earnings targets  evidence of underperformance is also observable across a broad range of key performance measures including headcount growth controllable expense levels assets under custody growth and investment servicing revenue growth  this management has both failed to reach its own goals and failed to keep up with key performance indicators of the competition  while there are aspects of the external environment that have created headwinds for the companys earnings power competitors face similar challenges and yet are proving much more adept in navigating the marketplace   the longrange targets put forward by management at the october analyst day were unresponsive unambitious and uninspiring  these tepid goals give further evidence that this leadership does not recognize the magnitude of inefficiency at the company or the opportunities to drive growth and has little appetite to take the necessary actions to ignite real change  given the unusually long tenure of this leadership group we doubt that meaningful progress will be achieved without new executive talent  it is not the boards role to micromanage the organization but it is the boards responsibility to set appropriate goals for the business and hold management accountable for failure to meet those goals  it is time for the board to exercise this responsibility we are including a presentation that details our analysis and conclusions on these topics  we are invested in the bank of new york mellon because we believe it has a strong franchise in an increasingly important and valuable part of the global capital markets  with the right leadership in place and the right goals we believe that the bank of new york mellon can deliver more effective services to clients play a critical role in monitoring and managing risk for the market and deliver significant value for shareholders  we would be happy to discuss our analysis at a time and location that would be convenient for the board sincerely mick mcguire cc
