immunotherapy leonard wagner laboratory of molecular genetics and immunology dr ravetch dissects the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the generation of antibody specificity and the translation of that specificity into cellular responses by identifying the genetic components that cause immune system cells to respond to specific antibodies dr ravetch hopes to gain a better understanding of how a functioning immune system protects organisms from invaders and how a dysfunctional immune system attacks the body’s own tissues the ravetch laboratory analyzes systemic autoimmunity in mouse models of certain diseases by investigating the genesis and fate of the pathological antigenantibody complexes that trigger tissue damage they simplify this problem by examining the mechanisms through which immune complexes influence both the afferent and efferent immune responses by interacting with a family of lowaffinity surface receptors the fc receptors these receptors are expressed as pairs of activation and inhibitory molecules and play a central role in appropriate immune responses dr ravetch has shown that inhibitory fc receptors for immunoglobulin g igg are responsible for maintaining peripheral tolerance animals without inhibitory fc receptors develop spontaneous autoimmunity and autoimmune disease conversely mice susceptible to autoimmune disease fail to develop it if they have deficient activation of fc receptors but loss of activation receptors does not alter the development of autoantibody and immune complex deposition rather dr ravetch has found that these potentially pathogenic complexes are unable to trigger effector cell responses and are therefore benign his lab is now investigating the precise cellular pathways engaged by activation receptors recent work from the ravetch lab showed that a sugar attached to igg antibodies confers their protective ability they are now working on a synthetic therapy rich in these sugarlinked antibodies another focus in the ravetch lab is the regulation of shifts from inhibition to activation he has demonstrated that removing the inhibitory pathway in vivo for example can dramatically increase the potency of a cytotoxic antitumor antibody this was the first demonstration of antibodydependent cell cytotoxicity in vivo current studies aim at manipulating the inhibitory response to enhance or limit the cytotoxicity of antibodies in vivo to better understand the role of these pathways and their therapeutic potential the lab is also working to determine the pathways through which the coupling of innate and adaptive mechanisms are coordinated two such pathways are currently under investigation the feedback by immune complexes on antigen presentation and the targeting of selected antigens to restricted follicular locations to initiate t cell independent responses using a series of mice deficient in specific fc receptors and immune complexes designed to selectively engage these pathways they are determining the role of each in activating or tolerizing presenting cells in vivo work by dr ravetch led to the cloning and mapping of the first malarial parasite chromosome and more recently to the cloning of the first fc receptor genes he discovered how immunoglobulin receptors mediate antibodytriggered inflammation and determined the mechanism by which intravenous immunoglobulin causes immunosuppression he also played a key role in establishing fc receptor pathways as an essential part of the immune response and in describing the mechanisms of

downey  – profile of jeffrey ravetch philip downey freelance science writer jeffrey ravetchs career path began with a focus on the smallest scale—individual molecules—then ramped up to studies in microbes mice and finally humans for his work in immunological research including contributions to unraveling the key mechanisms by which receptors for the invariant stem fc region of antibodies operate ravetch was elected to the national academy of sciences in  in his inaugural article ravetch and colleagues identified a receptor for sialylated fc that stimulates antiinflammatory pathways  the receptor could potentially be a useful therapeutic for many autoimmune diseases according to the study ravetch  is currently the theresa and eugene m lang professor and head of the leonard wagner laboratory of molecular genetics and immunology at the rockefeller university new york ny he grew up in nearby brooklyn excited by scientific breakthroughs like the launch of sputnik in the late s and the subsequent space race books such as paul de kruifs microbe hunters  and biographies of louis pasteur and albert einstein fueled his imagination “my heroes were scientists not sports figures” he says  next section clouds of chlorine ravetchs parents were teachers in new york city public schools and although neither taught science they were able to provide their son with books enrichment programs and leftover lab equipment “they let me do what i chose to in the basement i had a little makeshift laboratory where i would dabble” he says “youd get books at the library that would tell you about doing certain experiments and id make quite a mess as you might imagine i recall clouds of chlorine gas very distinctly when i discovered the power of laundry bleach” this selfdirected learning foreshadowed ravetchs academic career from his initial basement work through high school which offered little in terms of science education ravetch conducted his own experiments and pursued his own projects “my high school was a parochial school and didnt have any science facilities or teachers so my education was basically things i could do on my own” he says he would go on to spend summer camps at carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa work in a research lab on long island and spend time in a marine research lab in brooklyn in lieu of formal classwork during his youth view larger version in this window in a new window download ppt jeffrey ravetch after high school ravetch was admitted to yale university new haven ct in the late s “when i went to yale i was finally exposed to true science” he says “i was fortunate in being able to work in don crothers lab as an undergraduate and that was how i became a scientist i really owe don for having the patience to let a complete neophyte into the lab and break things” the crothers group studied the physical biochemistry of nucleic acids in particular synthetic rna duplexes “i got there in my freshman year and i just stayed nights weekends summers it was really my first scientific home i published my first paper when i was an undergraduate with don”  previous sectionnext section the great names sure that research was his destiny ravetch enrolled in rockefellers new mdphd program administered in tandem with weill cornell medical college new york ny as a molecular biophysics and biochemistry and english major he thought the combined program was a good way to get grounded in biology and its novelty attracted him “in those days rockefeller had a curriculum with no courses no exams—it reminded me of my early years being selfeducated you chose a laboratory you chose a mentor you decided what it was you wanted to study and designed a curriculum for yourself the qualifier was you had to find  faculty members who signed off to say you fulfilled their sense of requirements in their discipline” he recalls “i thought it was a great idea i loved the idea that to qualify in genetics you sat in norton zinders office for an hour and talked genetics if he thought you knew enough you were qualified it was more of the same with günter blobel in cell biology you had the opportunity—and you were required—to spend time with some of the great names in the field” ravetch worked in zinder and peter models joint lab at rockefeller focusing on bacterial and phage genetics dna sequencing was a brandnew technique “through the rumor mill we heard it was a technique wally gilbert had developed” he says “i was sent up to wallys lab to learn dna sequencing—there was no other way to do it i remember sitting in allan maxams little cubicle and he showed me all of the reagents and gave me the protocols on handwritten pages that i xeroxed then i brought the gels and dna sequencing to rockefeller and started teaching people how to do it here” one problem in the early days of sequencing was getting hold of restriction enzymes to manipulate dna “there were no companies selling these back then and you had to make each enzyme yourself so there was a black market in restriction enzymes” he says “you would make a few and then swap a few with a laboratory that had other ones” ravetch says after finishing his phd in  and md in  ravetch joined phil leders lab at the national institutes of health bethesda md leder had just finished a remarkable series of studies on the genes that encode the light chain of ig proteins and the rearrangements that generate antibody diversity ravetch arrived in time to study the heavy chains of immunoglobulins “there was a whole new world to figure out and we knew nothing about how the constant region could undergo this class switch recombination” he says “there were various postdoctoral researchers in all these labs around the world competing with each other each week wed read each others work in papers and phil would go to a meeting and call us back and say ‘well theres a lot of new information’ which was the bad news but we were still in the game and i think we did some interesting work from  to  it was an intense period of investigating this marvelously complex system of genes”   previous sectionnext section into fc receptors in  phil leder accepted the chairmanship of the department of genetics at harvard university cambridge ma “he dropped me off in new york on his way there” ravetch says “i took my freezer box full of the genes i had cloned and reagents i had made and started my own research group at the sloankettering institute across the street from rockefeller so i was close but not quite home yet” ravetch began research in two areas the genetics of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum and the constant or fc portion of antibody molecules the malaria research took off quickly and he was able to clone some of the first genes for p falciparum which revealed a genome that had undergone unique selection pressures resulting in unusual chromosomes   at the same time ravetch pursued the genes for an fc receptor a formidable cloning project due to the rarity of the mrna for these proteins and a lack of enthusiasm from colleagues “no one had any idea why there were fc receptors” he says “the prevailing idea was that the fc region stabilized the molecule and determined the halflife of the antibody and all of the effector function was attributed to the complement cascade so why would there even be fc receptors it made no biological sense there wasnt much interest basically i had it to myself”  through the late s and into the s ravetch showed that some fc receptors had important biological functions and that our understanding of the interactions between antibodies the complement system and inflammation was not just incomplete but flawed with a few fc receptors cloned his next step was to use the new technology of transgenic mice to create fc receptor knockout mice the step from cells to animals changed ravetch from a molecular biologist to a fullfledged immunologist the first knockout mice his group made were deficient in activating fc receptors which promote inflammation to ravetchs surprise the mice could not respond to immune complexes of antibodies  the result meant that antibodies and complement were not interacting as previously thought and that fc receptors were essential to initiate the inflammatory response many people considered the results heretical ravetch says the next mouse line that they made had no inhibitory fc receptor to calm inflammation  “when we made a mouse lacking the inhibitory receptor we saw enhanced inflammation in a variety of inflammatory models as you might expect” he says “but what we didnt expect was a spontaneous phenotype—meaning do nothing to the mice and they develop lupus  that really shocked us ” ravetchs research led to a new paradigm in immunology “it was one of the first examples of a balanced signaling system in an immunological system where it had both activating and inhibitory properties” he says “its kind of a common theme now in immunology many systems show this paradigm but when we first came across it in the mid to late s it was somewhat unusual” previous sectionnext section the significance of sialylation the next phase of ravetchs career began when he came across intravenous ig ivig a therapy for autoimmune diseases ivig is approved by the food and drug administration fda for a small number of diseases but is also used for ≈ autoimmune diseases the drug consists of concentrated iv doses of igg antibodies nearly a thousand times stronger than a normal treatment this apparent overdose suppresses the immune system instead of activating it “no one had any idea why there were fc receptors” to ravetch the bodys immune response to the medication indicated that a small fraction of the iggs were somehow different eventually he found that although all iggs are glycosylated a small fraction contain a sialic acid group added to the glycan sugars he was able to isolate this fraction and found that the sialic acid converts the igg fc region from a proinflammatory molecule to an antiinflammatory one  such converted iggs bind to a lectin on a regulatory cell population that subsequently stimulates an increase in expression of an inhibitory fc receptor on effector cells thus shutting down the inflammatory response  in his inaugural article  ravetch and colleagues identify the receptor for these sialylated fc fragments which is called signr in mice and dcsign in humans the receptor is unrelated to previously identified fc receptors and instead is a ctype lectin expressed on the surface of macrophages in the spleen of mice and on dendritic cells in humans without it sialylated fc fragments cannot suppress inflammation his results show that there is an unrecognized pathway that fc molecules stimulate to suppress inflammation the researchers suggest that regulatory cells release soluble factors that travel throughout the body which upregulate inhibitory fc receptors on effector macrophages calming inflammation ravetchs studies have had practical results for monoclonal antibodies like herceptin and rituximab which treat breast cancer and lymphoma respectively his work suggested that the fc receptor seems to be key to their ability to shrink tumors  “when i gave my first talk at an antibody therapeutic meeting in  and showed data that a mouse deficient in activating fc receptors could not modulate a tumor being treated with rituximab because it didnt have fc receptors the response was ‘thats completely impossible rituximab works because its modifying how this cd molecule is signaling’ and none of that is true” he says “thats not how it works at all” because of his work scientists designing the next generation of antibody therapeutics now take into account fc receptors and their glycosylation patterns as well as binding epitopes of the fab ravetch is now developing a sialylated fc portion to augment the efficacy of ivig he has a sample of a readily made experimental molecule and has found clinical researchers willing to test it  the current stumbling block is the financing required to make significant quantities of the drug that meet the fdas standards instead of working with a drug company ravetch and rockefeller have teamed up with venture capitalists to raise the necessary funds previous sectionnext section orchids in the lab despite having begun his career in molecular biology ravetch has also tried his hand at genetics immunology and glycobiology and he may venture into clinical trials with humans “our system has taken us through a lot of different areas” he says “and right now the push is to try understand what regulates glycosylation in vivo what the structural implications are on the binding specificity and what the signaling pathways are if this is in fact what is going on it should lead to an experiment in humans i would very much like to take ivig and make it  times more potent or make it as a recombinant its already worked in animal systems” ravetch has won several awards for his research including a national institutes of health merit award the lee c howley sr award and the william b coley award from the cancer research institute he is a member of the institute of medicine and is a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences and the american association for the advancement of science but ravetchs life isnt totally consumed by science besides his love of poetry which began when he was an undergraduate at yale he has devoted one corner of his lab to orchids which he his staff and students grow for fun relaxation and competition “the orchidarium is one of the places where people can sit and chat and have coffee” he says “it provides a welcome distraction its part of my philosophy—you should want to spend all your time in the lab it should be the best place you know its all about having an environment where you look forward to coming to work and just enjoy sticking around” previous sectionnext section footnotes this is a profile of a recently elected member of the national academy of sciences to accompany the members inaugural article on page  in issue  of

the rockefeller university hospital acknowledgments a new paradigm in immunology leading to improved therapies for autoimmune diseases ravetch jeffrey for decades intravenous therapy with immunoglobulin g igga preparation of antibodies purified from the blood of thousands of donorshas been used to treat lupus arthritis and other autoimmune diseases but this presents a paradox autoimmune diseases are triggered when igg attacks a persons own tissues so how can administering it as a therapy reduce inflammation rockefeller immunologist jeffrey v ravetch   has spent the last ten years unraveling iggs antiinflammatory effects at the molecular level and his results have provided the basis for designing new more potent antibodies for use as therapies against autoimmune diseases these advances in medicine are the result of ravetchs fundamental discoveries on the nature of the immune response in the early s he set out to discover the function of a region called fc on antibody or immunoglobulin molecules in  ravetch and colleagues were the first to clone genes for fc receptors which are found on immune cells such as macrophages in detailing the pathways by which immunoglobulins and fc receptors interact ravetch overturned conventional wisdom about how igg initiates an immune response previously scientists thought that igg worked through biochemical pathways known as the complement system to eliminate pathogens ravetchs research established the centrality of fc receptors in regulating both inflammation and immunosuppression triggered by antibodies he discovered that some fc receptors activate immune signaling whereas others inhibit it the inhibitory pathway is crucial for socalled immunological tolerancefor preventing the immune system from attacking its own tissues ravetchs genetic studies in mice have shown that animals without inhibitory fc receptors develop autoimmune disease and that restoring fc receptor levels prevents autoimmunity in a mouse model of lupus other researchers have implicated faulty fc receptors in several human autoimmune diseases ravetchs studies on fc receptors provided the basis for solving the paradox of intravenous igg therapy he discovered that iggs ability to either promote or suppress inflammation depends on whether its fc region contains a sugar molecule called sialic acid at its tip when present the sugar molecule confers antiinflammatory properties on igg when absent the igg molecules lose their immunosuppressive abilities and trigger inflammation an essential role for eliminating pathogens using this knowledge ravetch and colleagues produced an engineered sialylated igg molecule that was  times more effective than intravenous igg in mouse models of autoimmune diseases including arthritis these results have provided a route for developing alternative therapies to intravenous igg for people with autoimmune diseases in addition the new understanding of fc receptors revealed by ravetch and colleagues is aiding the development of antibodies for treating certain cancers beyond his pathbreaking discoveries on the mechanisms of antibody mediated inflammation and modulation ravetch discovered the first chemokine molecule ip opening the field of a new family of regulatory molecules in the immune response he also has contributed to the
