subject to risks similar to those of stocks including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements ordinary brokerage commissions apply the funds return may not match the return of the underlying index the fund is subject to certain other risks please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the fund most senior loans are made to corporations with below investmentgrade credit ratings and are subject to significant credit valuation and liquidity risk the value of the collateral securing a loan may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed may be found invalid or may be used to pay other outstanding obligations of the borrower under applicable law there is also the risk that the collateral may be difficult to liquidate or that a majority of the collateral may be illiquid debt securities are affected by changing interest rates and changes in their effective maturities and credit quality the values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods the fund is nondiversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment the funds use of a representative sampling approach will result in its holding a smaller number of bonds than are in the underlying index and may be subject to greater volatility the fund may hold illiquid securities that it may be unable to sell at the preferred time or price and could lose its entire investment in such securities under a participation in senior loans the fund generally will have rights that are more limited than those of lenders or of persons who acquire a senior loan by assignment in a participation the fund assumes the credit risk of the lender selling the participation in addition to the credit risk of the borrower in the event of the insolvency of the lender selling the participation the fund may be treated as a general creditor of the lender and may not have a senior claim to the lenders interest in the senior loan certain participations in senior loans are illiquid and difficult to value the fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash rather than principally inkind because of the nature of the funds investments as such investments in the fund may be less tax efficient than investments in etfs that create and redeem inkind investments focused in a particular industry are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility than more diversified investments the barclays us
