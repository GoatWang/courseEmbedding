markets down in midmorning trading amazon inks violet grey deal sources it‚Äôs not cheap or easy to be disruptive but if you slip up there might still be money to be had for a second try witness the bankruptcy of tamara mellon brand llc which was reported first on wwdcom wednesday night the official filings for the reorganization paint a picture of a brand that raised  million in  but never produced real topline traction and still found itself scraping for cash this year the company ‚Äî which jimmy choo cofounder tamara mellon launched with the intent of ‚Äúdisrupting the traditional fashion calendar and supply chain‚Äù with a shop now wear now strategy ‚Äî plans to pivot with a new venture capital partner and a new more direct path to the customer the company launched with a lot of buzz and a big name at the helm but a year ago it became plain more financing was needed shareholders ‚Äî which included wilton place inc and tm holdings one llc linked with ron perelman‚Äôs macandrews  forbes ‚Äî were given the opportunity to lend money to the brand two existing investors and one outside party did put in more money in january with subsequent advances in may june september october and november to fund payroll and pay vendors but the company owed roughly  million to mellon and other lenders and sought a fresh start ‚Äútmb needs additional funding however to accomplish the brand‚Äôs goal of becoming a vertically integrated high fashion ecommerce brand and survive as a viable going concern‚Äù the firm said in its filings ‚Äúdespite its best efforts tmb has not been able to secure additional funding outside of chapter ‚Äù that‚Äôs because some investors have not allowed it to raise new capital that would have priority over their interests and no new money was willing to come in subordinate to the existing equity holders according to the filings thus the prepackaged bankruptcy the company expects to pay the administrative expenses it owes and many other claims but the term loan will be paid in cash and preferred stock of the reorganized company the equity in the existing company will be wiped out mellon was the largest shareholder in the company holding  percent of its common stock as well as preferred shares if the reorganization plan is approved by delaware bankruptcy court mellon herself will extend the company  million in debtorinpossession financing for a roughly twomonth tour in chapter  the company that emerges will be capitalized with  million from new enterprise associates  lp and other lenders new enterprise will own  percent of the recapitalized company the menlo park califbased venture fund already has stakes in myriad companies including gilt groupe glamsquad groupon jetcom and moda operandi mellon will own a little more than  percent of the new company plus warrants and options the plan to get the company to break even is aggressive though and calls for revenues to move from  million next year to  million in  and  million in  to build up those sales the brand would spend  million of the  million in cash it will have on hand as it reemerges from bankruptcy tamara mellon initially launched her own brand with an eye toward selling shoes that would traditionally cost  ‚Äî say the price of a pair of jimmy choos¬†‚Äî for  by vertically integrating the supply chain the sales of tamara mellon  came from a mix of tamaramelloncom and highend online and brickandmortar merchants now the emphasis is on going straight to the consumer call it the warby parker or bonobos model ‚Äútmb believes that transitioning away from traditional retailers and concentrating on direct sales to customers via both internet and companyoperated stores will maximize tmb‚Äôs goals of shortening the design and manufacturing process enabling it to deliver to customers the fashion they want to wear now‚Äù the company said in a court filing mellon added ‚Äúwe will use this brief period of reorganization so we can position ourselves to take advantage of our new growth strategy and ensure the longterm vibrancy of our brand we expect that we will emerge from this stronger than ever in  days or less and all of us at tamara mellon look forward to pursuing our passion long into the future‚Äù the designer who gave her women‚Äôs wear a tribalgypsywarrior woman vibe is not alone in finding life at their own label tough after powering a runaway success coach inc‚Äôs former executive creative director reed krakoff also had difficulties with his own highend brand which took a broad approach and large initial spending to enter several categories and launch retail mellon also went big at launch and tried to start off running designers without the same kind of funding tend to start smaller build buzz and get known for one strength the eightyearold cushnie et ochs for instance has a reputation for its tight sexy dresses but a smaller presence in other categories now with fresh funding from farol asset management and a new chief executive officer in peter arnold the company is going to try to build out its offering with a tighter budget this time mellon might take a more focused approach for

london june   pictures by peter dench for fortune magazinemost powerful womentamara mellon on launching her own brand ‚Äòi‚Äôm trying to prove that jimmy choo wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äôkate samuelsonjun  despite all her success jimmy choo cofounder tamara mellon still feels a need to prove herselfspeaking monday at the dorchester hotel in london during the fortune most powerful women international summit mellon said that by creating her own fashion line she was trying to show that jimmy choo wasnt an accidentmellon founded the tamara mellon brand in  two years after leaving the luxury shoe company that she cofounded in  along with choo mellon built the brand into a footwear empire before eventually selling off her stake to luxury goods group labeluxbut when asked what it was like to walk away from the iconic shoe brand in  the yearold said it was the right decision it was incredibly difficult but i was just burnt out she told interviewer pattie sellers executive director of fortune mpw summits and live content  i mourned it while i was in it but by the time i left i was ready to goi could have stayed for five more years and made a ton more money but i felt i was selling my soul and i had to be happy within myself she addedwhen speaking about her career trajectory mellon said that she has been spurred on by a little bit of fear when i was younger i was motivated by this fire under me she explained it made me think oh my god where‚Äôs my life going to end up if i dont do something about itborn to an alcoholic mother and a father overwhelmed by the domestic situation mellon said she knew from a young age that she wanted to make her own money i never wanted to be dependent on my father or husband she told the summit audience i wanted to make my own decisionsthe british businesswoman left school without any qualifications and went to straight to work‚Äîa move she thinks has helped with her early success by the time i had founded jimmy choo i had a sound knowledge of the industry and working with luxury products from selling on the shop floor she saidmellons advice for those hoping to break into the fashion world is to just work‚Äîeven if its not your dream job or exactly what you want to do because you‚Äôll think of ideas and things will come to you when you‚Äôre being active it‚Äôs incredibly important just to workbut although the former vogue accessories editor did not go to college and described herself as terrible in school she does not recommend that her daughter yearold minty do the samei tell minty that an education is very important said mellon im very proud of her‚Äîshes pretty much a straighta student which i was not like at her age i always say you have to follow your passion and if you do then money will follow
