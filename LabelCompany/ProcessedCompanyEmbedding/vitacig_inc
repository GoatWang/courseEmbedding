top post by jcshay on jun    gmt  so ill finally give my review of the vitacigi ordered it online on th may electronic shipping info took  days to process and overall it took  weeks from online order for me to receive the vitacigs in my hand my package of  vitacig multipacks was shipped from pennsylvania i live and work in the netherlands though and for a reason unknown to me my package was in dutch customs for  days overall the individual packaging looks clean but almost too clean theres no language on the front or sides to indicate what the flavor is or what the vitacig actually is only on the back does it tell you that its called the relax or the refresh or the energize and all the wording is actually quite small and nowhere on the outside of the package does it say that it is nonnicotine not a single place the only place where it says that the vitacig is nonnicotine is on the inside of the package it is possible to see the wording without opening the package but that is difficultit is very possible that the simplicity of the packaging  not mentioning cigarette names or flavors or its nonnicotine nature on the front or sides  is deliberate both smokers and nonsmokers will pick up the vitacig in retail spots out of curiosity i imagine that many smokers who encounter vitacig for the first time in a retail store will buy it thinking that it has nicotine in itthe packaging is not easy to open its very childproof in fact its almost adultproof lol you need nails or strong fingertips to push in the black tabs that open the package i cant see many yearolds opening this by themselves theyd try and then get frustratedid like to see in the long run a box of  loose vitacigs each shrinkwrapped then you can hand them out really easily to friends and strangers you just pull one out of your pocket and people can remove the shrinkwrap currently thats not possible youre stuck giving them either an opened vitacig or the entire box and thats not as safe as giving a single shrinkwrapped vitacigthe vitacigs currently come in  flavors approximately as follows blueberry relax lemon energize and mintmenthol refreshthe relax to me has the weakest flavor theres a youtube video where a reviewer is saying that the relax is flavorful im not sure i agree while there is a bit of a tealike aftertaste i would hope that vitacig considers bumping the flavor concentration up maybe  or even  on the relaxthe energize is nice and tart if you take a goodsized draw you can taste the lemon but id bump the flavor concentration on this up maybe the refresh for me is the clear winner wow its a lot of fun to vape this one the mintmenthol flavor is really quite powerful i wouldnt change anything about itid like to see in the future different minty flavors peppermint spearmint cinnamon cool mint these would all be nice additions to the product line maybe down the line they should attempt some kind of joint venture or partnership with tic tacas for the vapor you can get quite a cloud if you sit there puffing for  seconds before a draw and of course thats when you can taste most of the flavorid have to agree with gvinvestments that the tip is a bit too clunky for me however at the same time when the tip is the same cylinder shape as the rest of the vitacig it looks like a pen very very stealth so i have mixed feelings about iti will say though that the rubber cap that it comes with is a bit flimsy in the pocket i have read at least one other reviewer complain that the rubber cap falls off when he puts his vitacig in his pocket i have had the same experienceoverall i can definitely see the potential of the vitacig even though im a nonsmoker i understand the coolness factor  i also understand the simplicity of the vitacig  you open the package and youre ready to go unlike these relatively complex ecigarettes where you have to mix or fill liquids  nonsmokers like me have absolutely zero interest in that ritualroutine last edit jun

to thank you for your investment patience and the ongoing support of our company as we have transitioned from a lengthy quiet period to aggressively rolling out a campaign to relaunch the companys products and brandsit should be evident that since our december th corporate update i have spent nearly every waking moment looking for ways to create lasting value for both mcig® inc  otcqb  mcig  and of course vitacig inc i wish to take this opportunity to recount our recent corporate actions and business activities as well as update their progressimmediately following the announcement vitacig company and brand would be relaunched i decided to build the vitacbd™ cbd division we brought to market several ultrapure highquality cbd product offerings such as our vitacbd™ cbd tincture oil vitacbd™ cbd ejuice and vitacbd™ cbd european gourmet chocolate this new line of products began to generate revenues for the company right out of the gate and found great traction with our network of existing wholesale and distribution accounts we are currently in the process of launching our corefour black and gold label vitacbd™ product line this new highend premium vitacbd™ cbd line will include tincture oil multiflavored cbd ejuice delicious cbd gummie edibles and a concentrated cbd wax our new vitacbd™ high end cbd product line is expected for release early next month and will feature a new highquality and redesigned corporate websitejanuary was a big month for us as we announced a landmark royalty and cbd distribution deal with our vitastik european partner as well as launching the vitastik product in japan and we couldnt be happier on how the product has been received since then we are pleased to report vitastik eu has placed their announced vitastik order through vitacig and vitacig collected their first royalty payment under this new agreement vitastik eu is expected to place their second large order later this week also a note to add vitastik eu ceo johannes luis has recently launched vitastik spain as well as vitastik australia and is expected to place another k unit order next week we expect more international product orders in march and look to expand deeper into asia over the coming monthsless than two weeks ago we relaunched our world famous vitacig® disposable vitamin vaporizer line it now features a fully mobile responsive interactive newly redesigned corporate website new logo and product design as well as new and exciting name changes for the flavors the results of our relaunch in the last two weeks have been nothing short of amazing we have had over  product preorders from individual customers several significant wholesale preorders and wholesaledistribution leads from all over the globe we will announce the close of some of these larger accounts in the near future due in part to our vitacig relaunch the company has generated more revenue since we relaunched in december than we generated in the first  months of last yearjust last week we announced vitacig closed a partnership agreement with a major chinese ecig manufacturer surpass international technology ltd under the terms of the agreement surpass has agreed to provide vitacig with disposables rechargeable ecigs the latest vaporizers and technology they are producing and also related accessories the fruit of this relationship continues to grow next quarter as part of this new agreement vitacig will be rolling out a special vitacig® allstar rechargeable unit which uses prefilled liquid capsules and will be available in all of our amazing vitacig® flavorsin moving forward from here many of you know mcig inc is vitacigs largest shareholder and as owner of a  equity stake in vitacig company no one has a more vested interest in building value for vitacig then mcig does to demonstrate our longterm commitment and reaffirm our unwavering confidence in vitacigs future mcig has agreed to lock up its shares for a period of one year following the end of the lock up period we will evaluate our position and likely extend the agreement barring any unforeseen necessity not to do so i sincerely hope our shareholders and potential investors alike see this decision by mcig and its management team as a sign of good things to come and demonstrate our commitment to reduce any harmful dilution toward our shareholders at such an early stage in vitacigs development i pride myself in putting shareholders first i always have and always will i understand full well that most other companies in our position and in our space would not prioritize their shareholders which is what this decision has made obviousread morein closing we have narrowed our pick of potential candidates for the new ceo of vitacig to three we will make an announcement when a decision has become finalized at that time we will encourage the new ceo following meeting qb status qualifications to immediately put in paperwork to file for otcqb status our vitacbd™ cbd beverage division and new vitacig flavors and products are also expected to be unveiled this fiscal yearon behalf of the entire vitacig management team i would like to thank you again for your continued support in closing i wholeheartedly believe that we have the best talent expertise and strategic approach necessary to create dominance and value in everything that we are setting out to accomplish
