on november   kmart holdings corporation announced its intention to purchase sears roebuck and co the new corporation announced that it would continue to operate stores under both the sears and kmart brands the merger of kmart and sears closed on march   emerging kmart from chapter  bankruptcy protection following affirmative shareholder votes of both companies sears holdings now operates sears and kmart stores the company continues to market products under brands held by both companies the two companies cited several reasons for combining forces sears had begun investing in new larger offmall stores called sears grand earlier in the year sears had purchased dozens of current super kmart locations the merger permitted the combined company to accelerate that process proprietary brands held by both companies could be made more accessible to their target demographics by leveraging their combined real estate holdings this was estimated to be an expected  million a year in revenue synergies at least  million a year in cost savings was expected annually particularly in the supply chain and in administrative overhead the establishment of a shared customerfocused corporate culture between the two companies was estimated to yield improvements in revenue per unit area preservation of two brands after the merger was intended to allow sears holdings to continue focusing on different customer demographics without alienating either group the company is directed by a board of directors composed of members from the two companies seven members from kmarts board and three from sears shareholders in the kmart corporation received one share in the new company shares of sears roebuck and company stock were converted into a combination of  percent stock and  percent cash at  a share stockholders had a choice of receiving either stock or cash subject to the predefined ratio the merger was completed on march   after receiving regulatory approval from the government and approval by shareholders of both companies sedit the exterior of a typical sears essentials store sears holdings continues to operate stores under the sears and kmart mastheads in  sears introduced a new store format called sears essentials some kmart stores were converted to sears essentials as well as a few locations that were acquired from walmart and several bankrupt discount retailers the new store format combined the sears store concept with the kmart format which was supposed to help the company better compete with walmart and target the project has since been resigned and merged with the sears grand concept sears holdings has begun crossselling merchandise between its two brands for example craftsman tools are now available in kmart stores they were previously exclusive to the sears brand however martha stewart brand paint colors are now no longer available at sears sears holdings currently owns  percent of sears canada a large department store chain in canada similar to the us stores at one point it owned as much as  of the canadian company but it failed in  to buy the remainder of sears canada that it did not own because bill ackman took a  percent stake in it and prevented any takeover he accepted to sell his stake at  a share on april   sears holdings also owns  percent of sears mexico carlos slim owns the other  percent like target stores kmartbranded stores

trump brands min readreuters  trumpbranded consumer products have suffered new blows with us retailers sears holdings corp and kmart corp discontinuing online sales of  trump home items while new details emerged showing sales of ivanka trumps brand fell in the weeks before nordstrom inc stopped carrying her products sears and its wholly owned subsidiary kmart disclosed their decision on saturday saying it was part of a push to focus their online business on the most profitable items separately the wall street journal reported on saturday that nordstrom sales of ivanka trumps brand had dropped sharply before the retailer discontinued sales this week citing internal nordstrom data the journal reported sales of ivanka trumpbranded clothing and shoes had dropped more than  percent in the second third and fourth week of october compared with the same weeks the previous year the election was held on nov  the developments were the latest in a week of controversy swirling around commercial activity connected to the trump name and the moves may be a rare sign of companies taking calculated risks in making business decisions that might invite criticism from president donald trumps twitter account neil stern a retail consultant for mcmillan doolittle said nordstrom may have felt insulated given its stores tend to be located in cities and affluent suburbs which tend to tack democratic “if there is a political blowback they will survive it given where there stores are” he said for sears which last month announced plans to close  stores any publicity that draws attention away from the retailers financial struggles is welcome stern added a sears department store is seen in new hyde park new york us january  shannon stapletonon friday three athletes sponsored by under armour inc took to social media to distance themselves from comments by the companys chief executive kevin plank in support of president trump earlier in the week a congressional committee said it was seeking a review into whether senior white house adviser kellyanne conway had violated ethics rules by using her position to promote ivanka trumps product lines prior to conways comments donald trump used twitter to defend his daughter in the wake of nordstroms decision to discontinue her product line white house spokesman sean spicer characterized the nordstrom move as a direct attack on the presidents policies customers are seen outside of a kmart department store in killeen texas us january  mohammad khursheedneither sears nor kmart carried the trump home products in their retail stores a sears holdings corp spokesman said as part of the company’s initiative to optimize its online product assortment we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items spokesman brian hanover said in a statement amid that streamlining effort  trump home items were among the items removed online this week he said adding those items can be found through a thirdparty vendor without providing additional information about the products the trump home collection includes lines of furniture bedding and lighting often from makers that supply trump hotels according to the collections website nordstrom in announcing the discontinuation of ivanka trumps line last week said sales had steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense to continue selling the products reporting by jon herskovitz in austin texas additional reporting by joel schectman in washington writing by david greising editing by grant mccool and matthew lewis
