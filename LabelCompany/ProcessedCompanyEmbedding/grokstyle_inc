coldewey  shares next story spotify trades freetier album delays for smaller royalties one of the things i’ve always wanted from technology is the ability to point my phone at something or take a screenshot and have it say here’s what that thing is and here’s where you can buy it well my lavish consumerist dream is starting to come true and grokstyle is one company working to make it so — in this case automatically identifying furniture and home decor from just about any picture or angle the basic idea is this you open an app or web interface and upload or take a picture of say a chair or lamp you like any angle any style the grokstyle service immediately returns the closest matches either including the object itself or ones very like it that would of course be very handy for any interior decorator but ordinary shoppers can make it work too see a cool lamp at restoration hardware but can’t see yourself spending  on it maybe cb has something similar — grokstyle would have hooks into individual stores’ inventories so you could check that sort of thing or sort by price range related articles wtf is computer vision matroid can watch videos and detect anything within them laying a trap for selfdriving cars as a business it would offer its service as an api that retail apps or web interfaces could call and having the deep knowledge of what different designers rooms and regions have put together it could even recommend say an end table to go with the couch you just looked up at heart it’s all about computer vision and machine learning of course figuring out what the picture is of then the contours of the piece the dimensions colors and so on and matching that info to a library of millions the company has collected “the company started from research at cornell” said cofounder and ceo sean bell “we were focused on the question ‘what is it’ and we developed the best tech for that problem” it isn’t easy lighting occlusion weird angles — not to mention the intentions of the user did they mean to shoot the table or the chair next to it and is that walnut or cherry easy or not they made it work and the resulting system is so fast it almost looks fake it isn’t watch a prototype in action here cofounder kavita bala led the lab that bell joined as a grad student and they presented the foundation for grokstyle’s tech at siggraph in  as it showed so much promise they decided to spin the project off as its own company something cornell clearly approved of “entrepreneurship at cornell has become a big deal over the last few years” bala said “we’re very plugged in they want us to succeed” part of that was of course getting hooked up with the people who have the money grokstyle started with a grant from the national science foundation for  and have parlayed that into a total of  million from a variety of firms and angels i don’t want to leave anyone out so i’m just going to quote sean’s summary canaan partners amino capital neuronvc krishna bharat exhead of google news amit singhal exhead of google search luc vincent vp of engineering at lyft red bear angels a cornell angel network and several other angel investors cb insights liked them enough to include them in the ai  list — no small feat considering the number of ai startups these days the plan right now is to push hard in the furniture space but that’s by no means the end of the story “we think the algorithm is generalizable” said bala “multiple people have talked about tv as a use case — if you had the right partners for that…” not to mention how this type of tech can be applied in fashion tourism and any other highly visual market furniture while there’s a great variety of it is at least stationary and relatively rigid you don’t have to worry about an ottoman flapping in the wind or whether a bar stool’s chairs will be in the same place second by second shoes and handbags however might act as a steppingoff point for the company in that space for now the company is working on getting partnerships up and running what they were i couldn’t get them to tell me and further expanding the algorithm’s accuracy and flexibility by hiring “a huge pile of engineers” you can learn

brickandmortar battle isnt really the battle its been made out to be at the shoptalk conference in las vegas earlier this year deloitte consulting chief retail innovation officer kasey m lobaugh noted that online sales which are roughly 8 of the total were up about  while brickandmortar sales rose  losses from brands such as sears holdings and macys both of which are losing share to online and smaller more agile retailers put a bit of a drag on those brick and mortar numbers while some may position the issue in retail as one of online vs brickandmortar our data shows that the issue is a more complicated blend of volatility and fragmentation of market share from a market where the barriers to entry have dropped and new competitors have flooded the market and stolen share lobaugh told the motley fool  ease of identification technology is in constant motion and now it can even go so far as to identify or get close to a product by a simple snap of a phone thats the idea behind
