linda kramers home in camanche kevin e schmidtquadcity times camanche salsa business heats up jennifer dewitt jul   jeremy jones of camanche iowa fills jars with kramers salsa at tom and linda kramers home in camanche kevin e schmidtquadcity times camanche iowa— linda kramer could measure the success of her salsa business by the fact her sales have been growing  percent to  percent a year she could measure it by the warehouse it now takes to store kramer’s salsa products or by the hundreds and hundreds of midwest grocery stores — big and small — that stock it on their shelves or there are the nearly dozen jobs the operation has created in her small hometown but kramer measures it by the size of the cooking pot “when we first started we used just one small pot” she said proudly showing a photograph of the original sixquart pot that was back in  when she made salsa two cases at a time on the weekend and sold it by wordofmouth today kramer’s salsa is still homemade in the basement of her home but it takes a crew of employees three apartmentsized stoves and three gigantic metal stock pots that each hold  gallons at a time “that’s as large as we can buy them” she said explaining how the pots cover all four burners on the stovetop “we don’t cook in vats so it doesn’t overcook the product that’s the secret” said kramer who owns the business with her husband tom “we do everything by hand the only thing here that is automated is a can opener” she said although she now buys processed and diced tomatoes all the onions and peppers are cut by hand each jar is handwashed and the salsa is dipped into jars one at a time after each jar cools sealing the lid a label is put on by hand even the jalapeno and habanero peppers are grown by hand by tom kramer who planted 6 pepper plants this year up from  plants a year ago “we started growing our own to control the quality” his wife said adding that last season’s crop lasted them through january her business was unfazed by this summer’s tomato scare kramer admits their methods may seem a little unorthodox but at full production they can produce up to  jars of salsa a week “what can i say — it just works” she said “it’s a small facility but it’s very adequate” the proof is in the company’s sales and distribution kramer said their salsas – and now a line of pepper jams – are in  major grocery stores ranging from fareway — kramer’s  first major grocer — to hyvee walmart supertarget and schnuck’s it also is sold through many independent grocery stores across the midwest kramer’s salsa was in  states with walmart but “logistics” forced the company to pull back distribution to iowa missouri and some of illinois “fuel prices are killing small businesses” she said the familyrun company recently has enlisted three major food distributors kehe foods gino’s and sweets and treats to help expand its reach “i hold the reins pretty tight” kramer said “if it doesn’t feel right to me it doesn’t happen other people in the family like growing faster not me” the company now employs  people fulltime at the kramers’ camanche home as well as  people parttime who do instore demonstrations in the des moines area among the employees are the kramers’ son shane who is in charge of sales and daughter jennifer who is in charge of the office side of the business robyn butz who supervises the salsa production has worked with kramer since the days when linda did inhome childcare — before the salsa business took over the basement and their onecar garage “when we did daycare everyone loved it” she said in those days tom kramer took salsa to work with him at union pacific railroad and sales really began to grow “the growth has been amazing it’s gone a long way” butz said crediting the success to the company’s family atmosphere and linda kramer’s drive “she’s usually got two phones to her ears” butz said their original salsa a mild variety nicknamed “grandma’s sauce” is now one of five levels of heat for the truly daring there also is inferno and habanero xxxtreme the company also has expanded products to include a variety of pepper jams and soup mixes five new salsa flavors — garlic onion cranberry raspberry cherry and mango peach pineapple — are due out next month just in time for the iowa state fair kramer who admits she gets her entrepreneurial spirit from her father bill logan says the idea for turning her passion for cooking into a business was born in  after a trip to ohio to celebrate her father’s th birthday her father was the owner of daisy donut shops in clinton and camanche — named for kramer’s mother daisy “here we were going to this party and we knew we didn’t want to take potato salad …” she said instead she took two cases of her homemade salsa after the incredible response from the partygoers “something just told me this could work as a business” in fact after returning home she called bob haxton the head of inspections for the state of iowa “he said if we were serious to do it the right way the first time” she recalled taking that cue she has every new recipe tested at the university of nebraska before it is put in production the kramers created a strong following by taking products to craft shows across the midwest as well as to the iowa state fair kramer said her family and friends still attend plus shows a year sometimes splitting up to cover multiple shows in a single weekend they travel across iowa to des moines sioux city council bluffs and others as well as to chicago and the quadcities “people love to meet us” she said “people say we’re crazy to do all these shows but we have met so many great people” by appearing with the iowa products at the fair she said “we can expose the product to a million people at a time” business really began to take off about five years ago after kramer’s salsa gradually broke into the grocery sector of course it all began at home when steve nauman the owner of camanche food pride let kramer put a display of her salsas in his store before that deal was made he said “she had people knocking at her door wanting to buy it i wish i was the only one carrying it” nauman even buys kramer salsa by the gallon to put on pizzas he serves at his camanche restaurant the food court kramer’s salsa also has begun supplying salsa for several quadcity mexican restaurants “she’s no  around here anyway” nauman said “she’s a real gogetter” kramer who will turn  this summer admits she’s a workaholic and probably never will retire in her space time she is a camanche city council member and a grandmother to eight of her own and  former daycare kids “it’s fulfillment something of the heart to see your product on the shelf” she said “it’s definitely not been easy but the rewards have been unbelievable — mainly the people we meet” kramer’s hot internationally kramer’s salsa landed a top international food award with its inferno salsa the salsa one of five levels of heat the company makes won first place in the  scovie award’s hot salsa category a total of  products competed for top honors in the contest the coveted scovie awards were created by dave dewitt editor of fieryfoods  bbq magazine and founder of the national fiery foods  barbeque show the awards are named for wilbur scoville who pioneered a rating scale for spicy foods that has become the industry standard for excellence in more than  categories of fiery foods the entries represented companies from  states and  four countries on the menu salsa kramer’s salsa comes in five levels of heat from mild which is known as “grandma’s sauce” to inferno and habanero xxxtreme for those who want more than blazing hot the company also offers a green olive salsa — an idea that came to founder linda kramer at  am after eating out one night and being served salad with green olives pepper jams kramer’s salsa went sweet in  when it introduced its line of pepper jams flavors include raspberry jalapeno jalapeno pepper cranberry jalapeno cherry jalapeno peach mango habanero and habanero pepper soup mixes the company also sells a line of soup mixes including tortilla soup cheesy enchilada soup and chili soup coming soon the company plans to introduce five new salsa flavors in august they are garlic onion cranberry raspberry and cherry and mango peach pineapple for more information call  99 or visit kramerspecialtyfoodscom jennifer dewitt

kramers best antique improver  other kramers bestproducts the kramers best product you will use most often is the kramers best antique improver it is very versatile and will cover most of your restoration and maintenance needs we do however offer  other products for more specialized needs you will not need these products as often but when you do they are your very best choice for the job kramers best blemish clarifier is a powerful natural cleaner it is useful and effective on wood metal and many other materials use it for severe cleaning projects that go beyond what the antique improver can do blemish clarifier is very effective in tackling the removal of heavy grimy surface buildup and groundin grease and oil after becoming familiar with use of the clarifier you will know beforehand when it is needed but if you arent sure start with the antique improver if you do not see the required results precleaning with blemish clarifier may be necessary use the clarifier to go deep into the wood to help flush out embedded foreign materials or to help break down a thick surface buildup multiple cleanings may be necessary on the most severe cases the clarifier because of its natural and compatible ingredients goes deeply into the finish and the wood gently displacing foreign materials lifting them to the surface very old and severely damaged pieces might take several of these sessions to complete the restoration modern caustic cleaners may do the job quicker but damage to the finish and the wood could be tragic the final result of working slowly and surely with safe and gentle materials is worth the effort after cleaning with the clarifier use applications of kramers best antique improver to replace the natural oils and restore the color and beauty to the piece samples shown the old cabinet door shown above was found on the floor of a barn several applications of blemish clarifier were needed to flush out years of accumulated grime and dirt clarifier was also used on half of the wood plane right to remove groundin grease and dirt the boiler lid is an example of one of the products many other uses it does an exceptional job cleaning a variety of materials after cleaning with the clarifier each of these pieces had wipes of kramers best antique improver see the book of instructions and uses for full information   kramers best wood food oyl  is for use on food service items such as butcher blocks salad bowls cutting boards etc � anything that will be in direct contact with food keeping these utensils clean and safe requires regular washing with lots of hot soapy water and a scalding rinse these pieces soon dry out lose their color and will crack and split over time if left untreated as with other modern wood care products the formulations offered for the care of wooden food utensils usually have petroleum derivatives such as mineral oil as their base repeated use may leave a gummy buildup only materials natural to the wood are capable of furnishing what is necessary for effective care foodgrade oils such as the common vegetable oils may be more desirable but may turn rancid over time our kramers best wood food oyl  when applied occasionally as needed reverses the dryness and at the same time maintains the natural appearance and condition of the piece use your treenware as it was intended without worry if the wood seems dry work some of the wood food oyl into the wood continue to use and care for your pieces in your normal way reapplying the wood food oyl as necessary if you begin to see surface dryness return both the kramers best blemish clarifier and kramers best wood food oyl are exceptional products not everyone has a need for them and you may not use them as often as you do the antique improver but keep them in mind after you have become familiar with using the antique improver and seen what it can do you may find ways you can also use these to great benefit   complete information and
