dc february   the us consumer product safety commission provisionally has accepted a consent agreement with bassett furniture industries inc involving two crib styles that could pose a lifethreatening strangulation hazard to infants the terms of the agreement require bassett to undertake an extensive remedial action program and to pay a  civil penalty the firm estimates that the cost of the program including the civil penalty could be as high as  million the commission provisionally approved the consent agreement on february  by a  vote with commissioners zagoria and statler dissenting both dissenting commissioners believe that the amount of the civil penalty levied should be greater a copy of the dissent is attached bassett furniture industries inc of bassett virginia is the manufacturer of the candlelite and mandalay style cribs which reported have caused six infant deaths since  cpsc staff believes that the crib design is such that infants can trap their heads between a corner post and the headboard or footboard and strangle as they stand on the crib mattress the agreement pertains to the mandalay crib models   and  and to candlelite models    and  the model numbers can be found on an adhesive label affixed to the inside of the headboard below the mattress level the mandalay cribs were manufactured from february  through october  and sold nationwide for approximately  to  in retail stores the candlelite cribs sold for approximately  nationwide and were produced from december  to midoctober  consumers who own one of these cribs which has not yet been modified immediately should contact bassett to obtain a free repair kit or instructions for eliminating the hazard consumers can contact bassett at its tollfree number l in virginia consumers should place a collect telephone call to bassett at   extension  in its proposed complaint against bassett cpsc staff alleged that the two crib styles pose a substantial risk of strangulation injuries or death to infants cpsc staff alleged that the firm knew as early as september  that its candlelite cribs could cause strangulation deaths of infants but that bassett did not notify cpsc staff of the potential hazard as required by law the complaint also alleged that bassett knew or should have known in march  that the mandalay cribs could present a strangulation hazard but failed to report to cpsc staff in entering into the consent agreement bassett does not admit that it had an obligation to report that reportable information exists or that the product presented a substantial hazard bassett had been undertaking corrective action since february  to locate and modify the potentially hazardous cribs despite its efforts approximately  mandalay style cribs out of an estimated  produced and about  candlelite cribs of  produced still may not have been modified to eliminate the hazard the central part of the consent agreement requires bassett to take the unprecedented step of sending hazard notifications by direct mail to all parents who have had children within the previous  months this mailing is expected to include more than four million parents of infants and young children in addition bassett will purchase advertising space in tv guide and family circle magazines in which they will run lpage advertisements warning consumers of the potential crib hazard these magazines have a combined total readership of more than  million people as an added incentive to consumers bassett will pay a  cash award to anyone who identifies the location of an unmodified crib once its repair has been verified bassett further has agreed to mail posters which describe the crib hazard and the needed safety modification to all obstetricians and gynecologists practicing in the us as well as to all pediatric and maternity clinics for display in their offices as part of its earlier voluntary corrective action with cpsc bassett already has distributed posters to approximately  pediatricians and to some medical clinics in addition bassett agreed to pay a civil penalty of  settlement of cpsc staffs allegation that the firm failed promptly to report the alleged defect in the cribs the commission will vote whether to give final approval to the agreement following a sevenday public comment period which opens on february  when the agreement is published in the federal register interested persons should submit their written comments by no later than february  to cpscs office of the secretary consumer product safety commission washington dc  the commission will consider all comments in deciding whether to give final approval to the agreement   consumer product safety commission of the united states of america   in the mater of bassett furniture industries inc a corporation and bassett furniture industries of north carolina inc a corporation     dissenting opinion of commissioner sam zagoria joined in by commissioner stuart statler   the corrective action plan negotiated by our staff with bassett furniture industries is a good one i regret that a majority of the commission has decided to choose the option of approving the plan and accepting a civil penalty of only  for failure to report in a timely manner as required by law the existence of two substantial product hazards the other option of approving the very same corrective action plan and issuing a complaint consisting of two counts because of the styles of cribs involved with a potential fine of up to  is a more appropriate one this is a case allegedly involving the nonreporting of an infant death and other serious incidents by a firm which describes itself as the worlds largest furniture manufacturer with reported annual sales of  i recognize that litigation is fraught with uncertainties but here where an infant strangled to death protection of consumers would be better served by seeking a higher penalty as a point of reference corning glass works paid a  civil penalty in a  case where there were no deaths on balance i would have chosen to issue a complaint against bassett and sought a fine larger than        the us consumer product safety commission is charged with

release  next release pdf bassett announces fourth quarter and fiscal  results bassett va feb   globenewswire via comtex news network  bassett furniture industries inc nasdaqbset announced today its results of operations for its fiscal year and quarter ended november   sales for the fourth quarter of  were  million down  from the  million for the fourth quarter of  this shortfall is primarily due to continued soft furniture retail conditions fueled by the significant economic turmoil during the fourth quarter of  that affected the financial markets consumer confidence and spending on bigticket items such as furniture see also discussion in wholesale and retail segments below gross margins in the fourth quarter of  were  as compared to  for  this increase is due to improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments selling general and administrative expenses decreased  million for the fourth quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of  primarily due to decreased spending in our wholesale and retail segments offset by a  million increase in bad debt expense bad debt expense increased due to store closings both planned and completed and the prolonged weak retail environment that is affecting certain licensees within the companys retail network the company also recorded a significant noncash charge of  million to writeoff substantially all of the deferred tax assets previously recorded the company reported a net loss of  million or  per share for the quarter ended november   as compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the quarter ended november   see the attached reconciliation of net loss as reported to net loss as adjusted to compare quarter over quarter results without these unusual charges business deteriorated significantly as the  fourth quarter progressed negatively affecting our results on several fronts said robert h spilman jr president and chief executive officer in addition to the extremely weak economy and its effect on the furniture industry the midseptember worldwide financial meltdown impacted the value of our investment portfolio as well the company incurred non cash charges totaling  million comprised of writeoffs of deferred income tax assets a goodwill writeoff and the impairment of its marketable securities portfolio furthermore the company recorded  million of bad debt reserves during the quarter these charges were partially offset by  million of proceeds from the cdsoa we are in an extremely volatile and difficult environment and are focusing our efforts squarely on the generation and preservation of cash at year end we had reduced inventories by  a  million reduction company wide headcount had dropped  despite the acquisition of four licensed stores during the course of the year we are continuing to assess our overall cost structure and inventory levels and are presently implementing plans to reduce both accordingly the company has recently suspended its employee k match and its quarterly dividend to shareholders we continue to work with our bassett home furnishings licensed store network to help our dealers weather this unprecedented storm we are focused on helping our dealers streamline their cash flow and to implement more aggressive product promotions in an attempt to stimulate consumer interest six underperforming licensee stores were closed and two were acquired during the quarter in addition to these efforts we are planning to close another  licensed stores in  and could acquire additional licensee stores at year end the network was comprised of  licensed and  corporate stores the corporate store network results improved slightly during the quarter despite an overall sales decline of  one store in atlanta and one in houston were converted to the new prototype both stores have produced significant comparable sales increases since their september st openings also of significance was the devastation caused by hurricane ike and its effect on houston one of our most productive markets our best store in the market was flooded requiring a complete remodel three other stores in the market were also temporarily closed for one to two weeks we are in the process of reshaping our product assortment in anticipation of a prolonged economic slump this includes a tighter assortment in general and an expansion of our faster turning custom upholstery products which have seen a smaller drop off in sales we are also working with our suppliers to offer even better values in this category these efforts should enable our dealers to have consistent access to our best selling skus and to concentrate on driving sales to the strongest part of our assortment sales for the years ended november   and november   were  million and  million respectively representing a decrease of  sales for the full year of  and  have been positively impacted by  million and  million respectively due to a change in the companys business practices with respect to freight for the delivery of wholesale furniture to our retail stores in july of  the company began invoicing these customers on a fully landed basis such that the invoice price includes freight excluding the effects of the business change sales decreased  this shortfall is primarily due to continued soft furniture retail conditions fueled by the significant economic turmoil during the fourth quarter of  that affected the financial markets consumer confidence and spending on bigticket items such as furniture due to our fiscal calendar net sales for  also reflect a  week period as compared to a  week period for  gross margins were  for fiscal  as compared to  for  excluding the effects of the above mentioned business change gross margins would have been  for  as compared to  for  this significant increase is due to improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments selling general and administrative expenses which excludes the effects of the business change noted above increased  million due primarily to a  million increase in bad debt expense partially offset by decreased spending in the wholesale segment bad debt expense increased due to store closings both planned and completed and the prolonged weak retail environment that is affecting our licensed retail network the company also recorded a significant noncash tax charge of  million to writeoff substantially all of the deferred tax assets previously recorded the company reported a net loss of  million or  per share for the year ended november   as compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the year ended november   see the attached reconciliation of net loss as reported to net loss as adjusted to compare year over year results without these unusual charges the operating loss reported by the company in  exclusive of the impairment charges discussed below is primarily due to losses incurred by the companys retail segment and to the reserves recorded for bad debts related to sales to certain licensee stores within its wholesale segment these losses reflect both the deteriorating home furnishings retail environment and the shortfall between the amount of sales required to break even on an average per store basis and the amount of sales that were actually written and delivered the company continues to take actions to improve per store sales performance including adding new more value oriented product offerings strengthening its design and sales talent and incorporating elements of the new store prototype into more of its stores in addition we are closing underperforming stores that we do not believe will be able to meet their required breakeven sales levels further we are reducing the cost and expense structure of our wholesale segment to reflect this lower level of sales and the reduced number of stores restructurings other nonrecurring items and income taxes our  and  results were negatively impacted by certain restructuring and nonrecurring items totaling  million and  million respectively unusual items for the quarter and year ended november   included a  million charge to writeoff the goodwill remaining on the wholesale reporting unit and a  million charge related to the impairment of other intangibles which were both recorded in the fourth quarter of  the company also recorded  million for the impairment of leasehold improvements and  million for lease exit costs related to the closure of a corporate retail store  million of legal and other expenses for the proxy contest with costa brava partnership iii lp and a  million gain associated with the sale of the companys former airplane in accordance with sfas no  accounting for income taxes sfas no  the company evaluates its deferred income tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted sfas no  requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard due to the losses in the fourth quarter of  the company is in a cumulative loss position for the past three years which is considered significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome on a more likely than not standard through objectively verifiable data while the companys longterm financial outlook remains positive and the company has certain tax planning strategies that could produce taxable income and may help it to realize its deferred tax assets the company concluded that its ability to rely on its longterm outlook and forecasts as to future taxable income was limited due to uncertainty created by the weight of the negative evidence including the cumulative losses and a market capitalization well below its book value during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a  million charge to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of its deferred tax assets wholesale segment net sales for the wholesale segment were  million for the fourth quarter of   below the level attained in the fourth quarter of  net sales for the year ended november   were  million as compared to  million for the year ended november   a decrease of  the full year fiscal  and  reported sales were increased by reported revenue of  million and  million respectively due to a change in the business practices as described above excluding this change recorded revenue decreased  for the fourth quarter and  year over year due to our fiscal calendar net sales for  also reflect

quarter of  as compared to  for  gross margins for the year ended november   were  as compared to  for the year ended november   excluding the effects of the business change noted above gross margins would have been  for fiscal  and  for fiscal  the year over year increase is primarily due to an improved product mix associated with increased imported products which carry a higher margin and the absence of the significant wind down costs incurred in  related to the closing of the bassett plant retail segment net sales for the retail segment were  million in the fourth quarter of  as compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  a decrease of  million as comparable store sales decreased  net sales for the year were  million in  as compared to  million in  an increase of  million the year over year sales increase primarily resulted from additional companyowned stores and a  increase in comparable store sales the comparable store sales increases were primarily driven by progress in the dallas market the benefits of store consolidation in upstate new york and increased sales in the pineville nc store due to its conversion to the new store prototype gross margins for  increased  percentage points due to improved pricing and promotional strategies our retail segment reduced its total operating losses by  million a  decrease for the  comparable corporate stores we reduced our operating losses by approximately  over  we believe that the combination of new product introductions store prototype retrofits better hiring and training of design consultants and continued improved

other income loss net for the year ended november   was  million as compared to  million for the year ended november   there were two primary factors that contributed to the loss in other income for the  fiscal fourth quarter and the year due to the significant decline in the financial markets during the fiscal fourth quarter many of the companys holdings sustained significant losses in accordance with the provisions of sfas no  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities the company recorded a  million charge for the other than temporary decline in the value of

asset fund which had historically produced returns in excess of the relevant market indices balance sheet and cash flow the company used  million of cash in operating activities during the year ended november   primarily to fund retail operating losses slower collections on accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable this use of cash was due to both the continued difficult environment at retail as well as payments to fund the inventory build at the end of  and the beginning of  for the january  new product rollout although the company plans additional product introductions in  they will not be as extensive as the rollout in early  the company expects overall inventory levels to decrease during  generating additional positive cash flow the company also funded  million in dividends including an  million special dividend in august and repurchased  million of common stock under a previously announced share repurchase plan these cash requirements were primarily funded through  million of net investment sales  million in dividends from an affiliate and  million in additional borrowings on the revolving credit facility subsequent events and status of investment

an opinion…all free of charge if you want to know how it all began we have to take you back to late s in the foothills of the blue ridge mountains to an area northwest of martinsville virginia the bassett family was running a sawmill that supplied rail ties for the new norfolk  western line that was being built through the family property in  the rail line was completed and the family began looking for markets for its lumber john david “jd” bassett was making a good living traveling the countryside selling goods for general stores when he began carrying lumber samples from the mill he quickly made his first sale of lumber to a coffin company in winstonsalem north carolina and returned home with the knowledge of the growing furniture industry and the subsequent demand for raw lumber he soon had orders for oak from several furniture companies in north carolina he quickly learned that the best markets for appalachian oak was up north and he made inroads into those markets “here i was shipping raw lumber from henry county virginia to jamestown new york and grand rapids michigan where factories converted that lumber into finished furniture to be shipped everywhere including the south” jd recalled “it seemed to me that furniture certainly could be made in henry county at a tremendous advantage bassett and his brothers laid out a plan and in  the bassett furniture company was born at first the company had about  men from farms and the surrounding hills and focused on styles made of oak and features simple profiles with carved overlays early dressers sold for  washstands for  and beds for  by  company sales reached  million but family members had opened new divisions that ultimately competed with each other for sales in  a “house divided” meeting was called and the different companies were incorporated into bassett furniture industries inc in  the postwar years brought rapid growth as large neighborhoods sprang up quickly around the country in the early s the company bought prestige furniture corp and added upholstery to its line up and acquired three other companies to expand its bedroom and dining room production furniture markets began to shift in the s and many “momandpop” stores were closed as large store chains with “noname” furniture were gaining a foothold seeing this trend bassett opened its first store in  the design was a departure from the compartmentalized rooms of typical furniture stores with little display merchandising today bassett remains committed to the early principles of the company … that great quality stylish furniture does
