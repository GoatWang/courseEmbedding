governance contact us other cornerstone funds other cornerstone funds   cornerstone total return fund inc crf welcome cornerstone strategic value fund inc is a diversified closedend management investment company it was incorporated in maryland on may   and commenced investment operations on june   the fund’s shares of common stock are traded on the nyse american marketplace under the ticker symbol “clm” although the fund’s common stock has frequently traded at a premium to its net asset value during the past several years shares of closedend funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value closedend funds differ from openend management investment companies commonly referred to as mutual funds in that closedend funds do not redeem their shares at the option of the stockholder and generally list their shares for trading on a securities exchange by comparison mutual funds issue securities that are redeemable daily at net asset value at the option of the stockholder and typically engage in a continuous offering of their shares mutual funds are subject to continuous asset inflows and outflows that can complicate portfolio management whereas closedend funds generally can stay more fully invested in securities consistent with the closedend fund’s investment objectives and policies the fund’s investment objective is to seek longterm capital appreciation through investment in equity securities of us and nonus companies there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives in determining which securities to buy for the fund’s portfolio the fund’s investment adviser uses a balanced approach including “value” and “growth” investing by seeking out companies at reasonable prices without regard to sector or industry which demonstrate favorable longterm growth characteristics valuation and growth characteristics may be considered for purposes of selecting potential investment securities the fund may invest without limitation in other closedend investment companies and etfs provided that the fund limits its investment in securities issued by other investment companies so that not more than  of the outstanding voting stock of any one investment company will be owned by the fund as a stockholder in any investment company the fund will bear its ratable share of the investment company’s expenses and would remain subject to payment of the fund’s advisory and administrative fees with respect to the assets so invested site map  printable view  legal disclaimer      cornerstone strategic value fund inc press releases

general stock funds invest in value stocks growth stocks or a blend of the two capitalization stock funds also choose investments based on the size or capitalization of a company companies are considered either small mid or largecap see a complete list of vanguard stock funds do i want domestic or international stocks investing in both us and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already wellbalanced portfolio would i prefer index or active funds do you feel more comfortable tracking the market or would you rather try to beat it index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund while actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark they can also underperform compare index funds vs actively managed funds should i focus on a specific industry you can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market like health care technology or telecommunicationsbut remember these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk sector and specialty funds should only be

bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
