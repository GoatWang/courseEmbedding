trust investment objective is to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax and florida intangible personal property tax the trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal bonds exempt from federal income taxes except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax the trust invests at least  of its assets in municipal bonds that are investment grade quality at the time of investment the trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives due to the repeal of the florida intangible personal property tax the board approved an amended policy in september  allowing the trust the flexibility to invest in municipal obligations regardless of geographical locationno
