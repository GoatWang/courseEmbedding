internet explorer  requires windows  with service pack  navigate to the ie download page to get the new browser ie has low system requirementsâa mhz processor mb of ram a super vga graphics adapter

browsers own interface features the combined address and search box sometimes gets too small but you can drag its edge with the mouse to enlarge it i actually prefer firefoxs separate search boxes since searching and address entry are to me two different operations you can still enable ies menus and toolbars by rightclicking on the top window border and checking the appropriate box and you can temporarily enable the menu by hittingÂ f like chrome ie has just five buttons across the top of the browser window not counting those inside the address bar tabs ies simple squaredoff tabs boast some
