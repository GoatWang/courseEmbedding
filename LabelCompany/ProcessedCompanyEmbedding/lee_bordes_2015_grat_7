frame product ie  made its debut on windows  but its also available for the more widely used windows  which still runs on the vast majority of pcs microsofts latest web browser is fast has a lean interface and is compliant with new standards it even leads in some areas such as graphics hardware acceleration and touch input in fact its so much faster leaner and more secure than previous versions that former users who left it behind may want to give it another try compare similar products compare google chrome   opera    mozilla firefox   view all  photos in gallery installation internet explorer  requires windows  with service pack  navigate to the ie download page to get the new browser ie has low system requirements—a mhz processor mb of ram a super vga graphics adapter and mb of hard disk space—so it should run comfortably on older pcs unlike the other major browsers an upgradeinstall of ie does involve a reboot since its akin to a system update but when you first run ie as with firefox you can simply start browsing neither pushes you to sign into an online account the way chrome does the one thing you have to do is choose whether to use smartscreen protection and send do not track messages to sites this is better handled than in previous ie versions most people didnt bother running the initial settings wizard so it would pop up every time the browser started interface upgraders from ie or even ie will be hardpressed to notice any changes in the browsers interface its actually even lower key than chromes with the narrowest window frame across the top of any browser since it places the search bar on the same row as the tabs window and controls ie s interface is as trim as it gets giving more area to the webpage contents and the least to the browsers own interface features the combined address and search box sometimes gets too small but you can drag its edge with the mouse to enlarge it i actually prefer firefoxs separate search boxes since searching and address entry are to me two different operations you can still enable ies menus and toolbars by rightclicking on the top window border and checking the appropriate box and you can temporarily enable the menu by hitting f like chrome ie has just five buttons across the top of the browser window not counting those inside the address bar tabs ies simple squaredoff tabs boast some nifty capabilities as with other browsers ie lets you drag a tabs position or even pull it out into a new window but unlike other browsers an ie tab dragged to the side of the screen takes up exactly half the screens real estate in standard windows behavior a web video even continues to play as you drag it another nice touch in ie is that you can close a slew of open tabs by repeatedly clicking the x in the same spot firefox works this way too but chrome doesnt newtab page ies newtab page is possibly the most useful of all such pages not only does it show tiles for your frequently visited

xml data pinned sites not only get their own taskbar icons but their favicon is also used where a browser logo would normally be in the upper left corner of the window even the back and forward
