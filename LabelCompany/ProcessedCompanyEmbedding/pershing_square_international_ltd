square holdings went public on the euronext amsterdam ackman has one it is clear why retail investors and others might want a piece of the ackman mojo his new yorkbased pershing square limited partnership has delivered an annualized return of more than  percent since its  inception what is less clear however is whether the ipo which raised roughly  billion is good news for investors in the activist managers existing hedge fund vehicles which have  billion in assets as of june  mostly in pershing square pershing square ii and the offshore pershing square international if pershing square investors want to redeem it will take them two years to get all their money back in the meantime according to the terms of the ipo prospectus they could end up effectively subsidizing the lowerfeepaying investors in pershing square holdings unlike many hedge fund managers today ackman is not content to hit investment singles and doubles he is more of a go big or go home kind of guy sometimes such as when he took the real estate holding company general growth properties into and out of bankruptcy his trades can be phenomenally successful other times as in his  shareholder activism campaign against retailer target they flame out horribly all this makes for good copy and ackman woos the press as adeptly as he wields a powerpoint presentation but whereas his overall track record is strong his strategy can make for a whiteknuckle ride for investors exactly how hairy that ride can get has been obvious since ackmans notorious short of herbalife hlf much has been written and said about ackman and hlf but for anyone who has somehow been oblivious over the past two years yep its been going on that long or is in need of a quick refresher the story is this in december  ackman busted out a slide powerpoint presentation arguing that the cayman islandsdomiciled herbal supplement seller was nothing more then a ponzi scheme hlf which operates through a directorselling approach not dissimilar from say avon or tupperware fought back vigorously ackman announced he had a massive  millionshareplus short on the company other fund managers in particular dan loeb and carl icahn jumped on the other side of the trade the result has been an entertaining battle including a live cnbc shouting match between ackman and icahn and one of the most awkward bro hugs in human history for pershing square investors the ride has been less fun herbalife shares have careened from  to a high of more than  to trading in the  range today interestingly annualized returns of pershing square have remained strong the fund is up  percent yeartodate and returned  percent in  owing to successful bets elsewhere nonetheless the herbalife trade made some investors nervous and ackman experienced some redemptions according to the prospectus pershing square holdings currently has and is expected to have going forward very similar if not identical exposures to pershing square but investors in ackmans main fund however can withdraw only one eighth of their assets per quarter so investors who redeemed from pershing square in september  would only be able to get all of their money back by september  what the publicly traded closedend fund does is allow ackman the flexibility to have the courage of his convictions without having to worry that investors will get cold feet pershing square holdings  billion in assets which includes money that existing investors rolled into the new vehicle is his to invest as he pleases investors in the holding company who dont like what ackman is doing can sell their shares they have daily liquidity pershing square holdings also offers better fees than most hedge funds including pershing square according to the prospectus investors in pershing square holdings will pay a  percent management fee and a performance fee of up to  percent although pershing squares limited partners also pay a  percent management fee they pay a  percent performance fee what might really stick in their craw is that the more limitedpartner money pershing square has the less the holding company investors pay here is how it works under the terms of the deal pershing square holdings gets an additional reduction in fees which is based off how much the investment manager  that is the parent money management firm  makes off the other funds it manages so if pershing square holdings makes up  percent of the funds ackman is managing it pays a  percent performance fee if it makes up  percent or less of the total assets the holding company investors pay no performance fee right before the ipo pershing square holdings made up  percent of the aggregate feepaying assets though that number was expected to increase as a result of the ipo the ipo document helpfully provides an example of what a fee deduction might look like assuming  billion in other feepaying assets which is what the firm had as of the end of june and a net return before performance fee of  percent the holding company investors would receive an additional fee reduction of  million pershing square holdings is relying on the same investment team the same research resources the same office space and bloomberg terminals as the rest of pershing squares funds so the lockedup investor assets  as opposed to the permanent capital of the ipo  are effectively subsidizing the publicly traded shareholders who can sell their stock at any time pershing square international investors were offered the option to roll over the assets into the holding company pershing square holdings then is just one example of how extremely frustrating the hedge fund fee issue is for longterm asset owners if i am a provider of longterm capital i should be paid a premium for that instead increasingly the benefit of longterm money comes at a cost to the investors providing it the same is true of  act vehicles as hedge fund firms are charging a  percent management fee and  percent performance fee for their main funds while offering a discounted liquid  act version the frustration is all the greater when the longterm asset owners are large institutional investors such as pensions and sovereign wealth funds which are giving millions and sometimes even billions of dollars to one manager although pershing square holdings shares dropped after their debut i actually think the publicly traded model makes a great deal of sense for ackman he has said he hopes to mimic warren buffett and berkshire hathaway and its hardly a surprise that he is looking to the sage of omaha for inspiration and not say phil falcone  another controversial hedge fund manager who has found the holding company to be a viable structure for his ambition although in falcones case he had little or no other option and ackman has done well by pershing square limited partners but aside from the tax benefits hedge fund investors must be scratching their heads and wondering just when they became the suckers at the card table with their one eighth redemption schedule and  percent performance fee follow imogen rosesmith on twitter at imogennyc register for free today get
