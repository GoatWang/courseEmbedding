significantly impacted by its acquisitions  in evaluating investments in real estate sst ii differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment such information would be comparable only for publicly registered nontraded reits that have generally completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics by excluding expensed acquisition related expenses sst ii believes mffo provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with managements analysis of the investing and operating performance of its properties acquisition fees and expenses include payments to sst iis advisor and third parties acquisition related expenses under gaap are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income loss and income loss from continuing operations both of which are performance measures under gaap all paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by sst ii unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property  this represents the difference between the stated interest rate and the estimated market interest rate on assumed notes as of the date of acquisition such amounts have been excluded from mffo because sst ii believes mffo provides useful supplementary information by focusing on operating fundamentals rather than events not related to its normal operations sst ii is responsible for managing interest rate risk and does not rely on another party to manage such risk additional information regarding noi ffo and mffo net operating income noi noi is a nongaap measure that sst ii defines as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap generated from properties before corporate general and administrative expenses asset management fees interest expense depreciation amortization acquisition expenses and other nonproperty related expenses sst ii believes that noi is useful for investors as it provides a measure of the operating performance of its operating assets because noi excludes certain items that are not associated with the operation of the properties additionally sst ii believes that noi is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community however sst iis use of the term noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount funds from operations ffo and modified funds from operations mffo due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit an industry trade group has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations or ffo which sst ii believes to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a reit the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not equivalent to sst iis net income loss as determined under gaap sst ii defines ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit as revised in february  or the white paper the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis sst iis ffo calculation complies with nareits policy described above the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time diminution in value may occur if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or other measures necessary to maintain the assets are not undertaken however sst ii believes that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions including inflation interest rates the business cycle unemployment and consumer spending presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative in addition in the determination of ffo sst ii believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time an asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying value or book value exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows including net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under gaap from such asset testing for impairment is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis investors should note however that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property including estimated future net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of ffo as described above investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that sst ii intends to have a relatively limited term of its operations it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property to date sst ii has not recognized any impairments historical accounting for real estate involves the use of gaap any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in gaap nevertheless sst ii believes that the use of ffo which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments assists in providing a more complete understanding of its performance to investors and to its management and when compared year over year reflects the impact on sst iis operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs general and administrative expenses and interest costs which may not be immediately apparent from net income loss however ffo or modified funds from operations mffo discussed below should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current gaap methodology in calculating net income loss or in its applicability in evaluating sst iis operating performance the method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under gaap should be considered a more relevant measure of operational performance and is therefore given more prominence than the nongaap ffo and mffo measures and the adjustments to gaap in calculating ffo and mffo changes in the accounting and reporting rules under gaap that were put into effect and other changes to gaap accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of nareits definition of ffo have prompted an increase in cashsettled expenses specifically acquisition fees and expenses that are expensed as operating expenses under gaap sst ii believes these fees and expenses do not affect its overall longterm operating performance publicly registered nontraded reits typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation the purchase of properties and the corresponding expenses associated with that process is a key feature of sst iis business plan in order to generate operational income and cash flow in order to make distributions to investors while other startup entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years sst ii believes that publicly registered nontraded reits are unique in that they typically have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases as disclosed in the prospectus for sst iis offering sst ii will use the proceeds raised in its offering to acquire properties and sst ii expects to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event ie listing of its shares of common stock on a national securities exchange a merger or sale the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or another similar transaction within three to five years after the completion of its offering which is generally comparable to other publicly registered nontraded reits thus sst ii does not intend to continuously purchase assets and intends to have a limited life the decision whether to engage in any liquidity event is in the sole discretion of the board of directors of sst ii due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered nontraded reits the investment program association or the ipa an industry trade group has standardized a measure known as mffo which the ipa has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered nontraded reits and which sst ii believes to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered nontraded reit having the characteristics described above mffo is not equivalent to sst iis net income loss as determined under gaap and mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance on value if sst ii does not ultimately engage in a liquidity event sst ii believes that because mffo excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect its operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that sst ii considers more reflective of investing activities as well as other nonoperating items included in ffo mffo can provide on a goingforward basis an indication of the sustainability that is the capacity to continue to be maintained of sst iis operating performance after the period in which it is acquiring properties and once its portfolio is in place by providing mffo sst ii believes it is presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of its operating performance after its offering has been completed and its properties have been acquired sst ii also believes that mffo is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered nontraded reit industry further sst ii believes mffo is useful in comparing the sustainability of its operating performance after its offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities investors are cautioned that mffo should only be used to assess the sustainability of sst iis operating performance after its offering has been completed and properties have been acquired as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on sst iis operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired sst ii defines mffo a nongaap measure consistent with the ipas guideline  supplemental performance measure for publicly registered nonlisted reits modified funds from operations the practice guideline issued by the ipa in november  the practice guideline defines mffo as ffo further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of gaap net income loss acquisition fees and expenses amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of above or below intangible lease assets and liabilities accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments nonrecurring impairments of real estate related investments marktomarket adjustments included in net income nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from or deconsolidation to equity accounting adjustments relating to contingent purchase price obligations included in net income and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures with such adjustments calculated to reflect mffo on the same basis the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments unrealized gains and losses on hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income loss in calculating cash flows from operations and in some cases reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized sst iis mffo calculation complies with the ipas practice guideline described above in calculating mffo sst ii excludes acquisition related expenses the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange holdings and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests the other adjustments included in the ipas practice guideline are not applicable to sst ii for the periods presented acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by sst ii and it has not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from its offering to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses sst ii does not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses acquisition fees and expenses include payments to sst iis advisor and third parties acquisition related expenses under gaap are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income loss and income loss from continuing operations both of which are performance measures under gaap all paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by sst ii unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property in the future if sst ii is not able to raise additional proceeds from its offering this could result in sst ii paying acquisition fees or reimbursing acquisition expenses due to its advisor or a portion thereof with net proceeds from borrowed funds operational earnings or cash flows net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows as a result the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced or sst ii may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds further under gaap certain contemplated noncash fair value and other noncash adjustments are considered operating noncash adjustments to net income loss in determining cash flows from operations in addition sst ii views fair value adjustments of derivatives and the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance sst ii uses mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate its performance against other publicly registered nontraded reits which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter as noted above mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance if sst ii does not continue to operate in this manner sst ii believes that its use of mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it allow it to present its performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered nontraded reits such as their limited life limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy and hence that the use of such measures may be useful to investors for example acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of sst iis offering and other financing sources and not from operations by excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses the use of mffo provides information consistent with managements analysis of the operating performance of the properties additionally fair value adjustments which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates may not be directly related or attributable to sst iis current operating performance by excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses sst ii believes mffo provides useful supplemental information presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and mffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and mffo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from continuing operations as an indication of sst iis performance as an alternative to cash flows from operations which is an indication of sst iis liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund sst iis cash needs including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders ffo and mffo should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of sst iis performance mffo may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods and in particular after the offering and acquisition stages are complete neither the sec nareit nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that sst ii uses to calculate ffo or mffo in the future the sec nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered nontraded reit industry and sst ii would have to adjust its calculation and characterization of ffo or mffo about

approximately  million and  respectively in accretion of preferred equity costs as of december   we had redeemed all of the preferred units   in evaluating investments in real estate we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment such information would be comparable only for publicly registered nontraded reits that have generally completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics by excluding expensed acquisition related expenses we believe mffo provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with managements analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor and third parties acquisition related expenses under gaap are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income loss and income loss from continuing operations both of which are performance measures under gaap all paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property and the fees and expenses and other costs related to such property   this represents the difference between the stated interest rate and the estimated market interest rate on assumed notes as of the date of acquisition such amounts have been excluded from mffo because we believe mffo provides useful supplementary information by focusing on operating fundamentals rather than events not related to our normal operations we are responsible for managing interest rate risk and do not rely on another party to manage such risk additional information regarding noi ffo and mffo net operating income noi noi is a nongaap measure that we define as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap generated from properties before corporate general and administrative expenses asset management fees interest expense depreciation amortization acquisition expenses and other nonproperty related expenses we believe that noi is useful for investors as it provides a measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because noi excludes certain items that are not associated with the operation of the properties additionally we believe that noi is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community however our use of the term noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount funds from operations ffo and modified funds from operations mffo due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit an industry trade group has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations or ffo which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a reit the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not equivalent to our net income loss as determined under gaap we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit as revised in february  or the white paper the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis our ffo calculation complies with nareits policy described above the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time diminution in value may occur if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or other measures necessary to maintain the assets are not undertaken however we believe that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions including inflation interest rates the business cycle unemployment and consumer spending presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative in addition in the determination of ffo we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time an asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying value or book value exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows including net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under gaap from such asset testing for impairment is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis investors should note however that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property including estimated future net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of ffo as described above investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a relatively limited term of our operations it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property to date we have not recognized any impairments historical accounting for real estate involves the use of gaap any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in gaap nevertheless we believe that the use of ffo which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments assists in providing a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to our management and when compared year over year reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs general and administrative expenses and interest costs which may not be immediately apparent from net income loss however ffo or modified funds from operations mffo discussed below should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current gaap methodology in calculating net income loss or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance the method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under gaap should be considered a more relevant measure of operational performance and is therefore given more prominence than the nongaap ffo and mffo measures and the adjustments to gaap in calculating ffo and mffo changes in the accounting and reporting rules under gaap that were put into effect and other changes to gaap accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of nareits definition of ffo have prompted an increase in cashsettled expenses specifically acquisition fees and expenses that are expensed as operating expenses under gaap we believe these fees and expenses do not affect our overall longterm operating performance publicly registered nontraded reits typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation the purchase of properties and the corresponding expenses associated with that process is a key feature of our business plan in order to generate operational income and cash flow in order to make distributions to investors while other startup entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years we believe that publicly registered nontraded reits are unique in that they typically have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases as disclosed in the prospectus for our offering we will use the proceeds raised in our offering to acquire properties and we expect to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event ie listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange a merger or sale the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or another similar transaction within three to five years after the completion of our offering which is generally comparable to other publicly registered nontraded reits thus we do not intend to continuously purchase assets and intend to have a limited life the decision whether to engage in any liquidity event is in the sole discretion of our board of directors due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered nontraded reits the investment program association or the ipa an industry trade group has standardized a measure known as mffo which the ipa has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered nontraded reits and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered nontraded reit having the characteristics described above mffo is not equivalent to our net income loss as determined under gaap and mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance on value if we do not ultimately engage in a liquidity event we believe that because mffo excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that we consider more reflective of investing activities as well as other nonoperating items included in ffo mffo can provide on a goingforward basis an indication of the sustainability that is the capacity to continue to be maintained of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place by providing mffo we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired we also believe that mffo is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered nontraded reit industry further we believe mffo is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities investors are cautioned that mffo should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired we define mffo a nongaap measure consistent with the ipas guideline  supplemental performance measure for publicly registered nonlisted reits modified funds from operations the practice guideline issued by the ipa in november  the practice guideline defines mffo as ffo further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of gaap net income loss acquisition fees and expenses amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of above or below intangible lease assets and liabilities accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments nonrecurring impairments of real estate related investments marktomarket adjustments included in net income nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from or deconsolidation to equity accounting and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures with such adjustments calculated to reflect mffo on the same basis the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments unrealized gains and losses on hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income loss in calculating cash flows from operations and in some cases reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized our mffo calculation complies with the ipas practice guideline described above in calculating mffo we exclude acquisition related expenses the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange holdings and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests the other adjustments included in the ipas practice guideline are not applicable to us for the periods presented acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from our offering to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses we do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor and third parties acquisition related expenses under gaap are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income loss and income loss from continuing operations both of which are performance measures under gaap all paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by us unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property in the future if we are not able to raise additional proceeds from our offering this could result in us paying acquisition fees or reimbursing acquisition expenses due to our advisor or a portion thereof with net proceeds from borrowed funds operational earnings or cash flows net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows as a result the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds further under gaap certain contemplated noncash fair value and other noncash adjustments are considered operating noncash adjustments to net income loss in determining cash flows from operations in addition we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance we use mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered nontraded reits which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter as noted above mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner we believe that our use of mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered nontraded reits such as their limited life limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy and hence that the use of such measures may be useful to investors for example acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of our offering and other financing sources and not from operations by excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses the use of mffo provides information consistent with managements analysis of the operating performance of the properties additionally fair value adjustments which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance by excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses we believe mffo provides useful supplemental information presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and mffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and mffo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from continuing operations as an indication of our performance as an alternative to cash flows from operations which is an indication of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders ffo and mffo should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance mffo may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods and in particular after the offering and acquisition stages are complete neither the sec nareit nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate ffo or mffo in the future the sec nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered nontraded reit industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of ffo or mffo about strategic storage trust ii inc sst ii sst ii is a public nontraded reit that focuses on stabilized self storage
