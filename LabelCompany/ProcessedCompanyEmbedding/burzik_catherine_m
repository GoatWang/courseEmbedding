boardrooms for the convenience of our students alumni and friends we are featuring the insightful article ballrooms and boardrooms as told by cathy burzik to abby ellin this article was first published in the new york tmes a version of this article appeared in print on august   on page bu of the new york edition with the headline ballrooms and boardrooms aug   my father fought in world war ii in the first cavalry division of the army and achieved the level of staff sergeant later he started a grocery store in jamestown ny my mother was a cashier in the store they married and had my sister and me i am the only person in my family who has gone on to college my parents always dreamed that i would be a teacher and so did i from very early on i did well in school i was the valedictorian of my high school class vice president of the student body president of the math club and editor of the school paper i majored in math and classical languages at canisius college in buffalo i received my master’s degree and started working toward my phd at the university of buffalo but then kodak came in and started interviewing i was hired as a software engineer doing programming and left graduate school within three years i was promoted to supervisor and then advanced to senior levels of management along the way i became involved in educating people about leadership early on i tried to understand what it takes to get people to follow you how do you create a vision and how do you inspire an organization i learned how to motivate a diverse team of people and how to encourage it to go after a mission you don’t learn those skills in college i think you learn by doing and you learn by having some great role models i have been fortunate to have people who helped me build those skills i’m close friends with my first boss at kodak john gallenberger along with my last boss there  years later carl kohrt who now serves on the board of my company kinetic concepts i made a decision in  that i wanted to put technology to use in health care i wanted to do something that helps patients i was recruited to johnson  johnson in the late s and ran two of its businesses — first in tampa fla then in raritan nj johnson  johnson is smack in the middle of health care which is exactly what i wanted to do it’s the same at kci where i’ve been the chief executive for about five years we provide among other things regenerative medicine products and highend wound healing products that use a technology called negative pressure wound therapy to remove infection thus speeding the healing process i’ve been married to frank burzik my high school sweetheart for  years we met while rollerskating when i was about  we have always liked to dance socially we used to go to the rainbow room in manhattan we now go ballroom dancing together in fact we just built a house with a ballroom in it ballroom dancing can teach you a lot about both life and business you can dance well only if you’re connected you learn the power of the partnership i have to be so unbelievably connected myself as the follower and my partner as leader i have to intuit in fractions of seconds how to respond to a lead so you learn to read a person’s mind i talk to my people at work about ballroom dance about how to be connected and to be aware of musicality in a business sense this means learning a threedimensional presentation of yourself that allows you to understand how to harmonize with others in the organization as well as with customers and patients it gives you the insight and intuition to anticipate and take initiative quickly and then to follow through in an informed way once or twice a year i invite my leadership committee members and their spouses over to my house and we dance and they’ve turned out to like it a few are even taking ballroom dance lessons now i like to think it’s my influence —as told to abby ellin catherine m burzik joins haemonetics
