verdines research interests lie in the emerging area of chemical biology he and his coworkers aim to gain a fundamental understanding of processes that control the expression and preserve the integrity of genetic information his studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which dnamodifying proteins  especially dna methyltransferases and dna repair proteins  recognize and process their substrates verdine is the codiscoverer of a key pathway for the repair of oxidatively damaged dna in higher organisms including man his efforts in the area of transcriptional regulation have resulted in the structural characterization of nfkb with s c harrison and the isolation and structural elucidation of the nuclear factor of activated t cells with a rao and g wagner respectively recently he solved a longstanding problem in transcriptional regulation by showing that acidic activation domains undergo induced ahelix formation upon binding to a target taf protein he is the first to show that a completely nonnatural molecule can coactivate transcription in cells thus paving the way for the discovery of small molecules that can directly activate the expression of specific genes

and proliferation of human cancer cells control of gene expression and preservation of genomic integrity our research has led to the invention of new and powerful approaches for the discovery of unconventional bioactive ligands termed synthetic biologics that have proven effective at addressing therapeutic targets previously considered undruggable verdine and coworkers have elucidated the mechanism by which dna methyltransferases catalyze epigenetic modification of the genome as well as the structural basis for sequence specific dna recognition by nfκb and nfat master regulators of

molecules fall into one of two established classes of drugs small molecules and biologics members of each class however suffer from fundamental physical limitations that necessarily restrict their operating range small molecules can target only the  of human proteins that bear a hydrophobic pocket on their surface whereas biologics can target only the  that are accessible via the cell exterior due to significant overlap of these slices of the proteome it is estimated that  of human proteins reside within the cell and lack a hydrophobic pocket causing them to be “undruggable” by either established therapeutic modality as accumulated functional and genomic information has irrefutably linked certain undruggable targets with causation of human disease the development of novel therapeutic modalities that can access these undruggable targets is becoming increasingly important to the future of medicine the verdine lab has pioneered a conformational stabilization technology termed allhydrocarbon peptide stapling which induces unstructured peptides to adopt a bioactive αhelical structure these allhydrocarbon stapled peptides display the ability to bind to biological targets with affinities in the nanomolar to picomolar range feature substantial resistance to degradation by proteases and penetrate the cell membrane through endocytic vesicle trafficking and are capable of inhibiting diseaserelevant proteinprotein interactions in vivo our laboratory has reported allhydrocarbon stapled peptide inhibitors of some of the most challenging biological targets the antiapoptotic protein bcl the notch transcription factor complex the e ubiquitin ligase hdm and the βcatenin transcription factor we are currently interested in not only applying allhydrocarbon stapled peptide technology to the development of αhelical agonists or antagonists of a wide variety of proteins including ras and the insulin receptor but we are also interested in using allhydrocarbon peptide stapling technology to stabilize tertiary structures such as helixturnhelix or αβ motifs another current area of research in the laboratory is development of novel peptide stapling strategies that will allow us to build upon the promising biological results observed for the allhydrocarbon peptide stapling technology read more protein catalysis on dna every organism from parasitic viruses to humans must maintain the integrity of its genome in order to successfully propagate the accurate transfer of genetic material to successive generations in the form of dna is the ultimate goal of all living entities dna like any chemical is subject to a wide variety of covalent modifications including alkylation oxidation hydrolysis and reduction these lead to mutations causing changes in the genetic code in order to prevent such changes all organisms actively scan their dna searching for damage and restoring the correct base our laboratory is interested in the study of enzymes involved in the chemical recognition and repair of damaged dna the base excision repair glysosylases are one class of repair enzymes this family of mechanistically related enzymes scans the genome looking for particular subsets of base damage and excises the aberrant base also studied are proteins that directly repair alkylated dna by transferring chemical modification onto the protein besides the fascinating questions of chemical recognition and catalysis preformed by these enzymes the study of dna repair mechanisms in humans is of interest because of the role of dna damage to disease and aging we have developed a comprehensive research program using synthetic chemistry molecular biology structural biology and genetics to study this class of proteins in order to gain insights into their role in genomic maintenance rna targeting conventional rnadirected therapeutic strategies have largely been limited toward sequencebased targeting of proteincoding messenger rnas rna biology however expands far beyond protein coding and rna is a key component in an everexpanding list of cellular processes furthermore it has become increasingly clear that the folded structures of rnas are critical to their diverse functions thus any strategy limited to mrna primary sequence excludes a vast and rich array of potential therapeutic rna targetsour strategy employs short rnainteracting polynucleotides riptides as a means for targeting rnas of interest short sequences mer or less allow for unbiased arraybased screening as all permutations of mer to mer nucleotides may be synthesized in an array and assayed for binding the rna of interest using screening conditions that allow for rna secondary structure formation we identify sequences capable of binding a folded rna structure rather than relying on a primary sequence with regions that may not be available for binding upon folding in addition unbiased screening leaves open the possibility of noncanonical basepairing not predicted by primary sequence alone with these lead sequences we take a multipronged chemical biology approach that incorporates strategies for chemical modification to increase rna stability and membrane permeability while closely investigating the biological impact of the discovered rnabinding sequences teaching  fall scrb  principles of drug discovery and development
