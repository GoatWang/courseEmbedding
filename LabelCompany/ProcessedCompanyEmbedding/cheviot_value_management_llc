wealth and financial security by investing to emphasize both capital appreciation and the preservation of accumulated capitalcapital appreciationwe seek capital appreciation by means of disciplined valueoriented investments in common stocks debt securities and publiclytraded real estate investment programs consisting solely of fixed dollar and fixed income investments such as bank deposits cds treasury bills and bonds may preserve capital but will not produce capital appreciationcapital preservationwe protect capital by means of portfolio management including asset allocation diversification avoiding inherently risky securities and by investing rather than speculating our value approach – shunning overpriced investments and striving to acquire those which are undervalued – helps to preserve the investor’s accumulated capital and to grow it safely over timeinvestment approachwe strive to earn favorable longterm rates of return in a less volatile manner than that which is endured via general stock market exposure we regularly seek and monitor high quality largecap companies with strong balance sheets high returns on invested capital and growing streams of free cash flow we prefer to own businesses with durable competitive advantages run by shareholderfriendly managements that are skilled at capital allocation shares of these companies are then purchased only when they become available at a discount to our estimate of their intrinsic value or true worth shares may be sold if the share price exceeds our estimate of intrinsic value if there is a reduction in

market have gone their separate ways in the past  months jj stock is down slightly compared to an  rise in the dow jones industrial average—of which jj is a member—and a  jump in the healthcare sector friday the stock jumped  to  but shares are off  from a high of the strong dollar and worries about the healthcare giant’s pharmaceuticals growth can be blamed for the weakness but longterm investors interested in a highquality name with both income and pricegain potential might take a second look as the clouds dissipate jj could deliver a doubledigit annual total returnone issue has been the muscular greenback jj gets more than half its sales overseas and the rising dollar had a negative impact of nearly  in the fourth quarter and another  in the recently reported first quarter causing sales declines in both periods—yet another unusual thing sales comparisons will likely be pressured for another quarter or twothe more important concern is remicade jj’s autoimmune medication that at  billion last year made up  of total sales of  billion its future growth could be dented by new competition and adverse us patent rulings it recently went off patent in a number of european countriescelltrion korea is attempting to introduce its ctp biosimilar in the us and jj has filed a lawsuit alleging infringement on its remicade patents additionally a remicade patent is being challenged by recent decisions from the us patent  trade office though appeals are ongoingthe remicade battles shouldn’t be ignored but a longterm investor has the luxury of viewing the head winds facing a giant like jj in a wider context this is a healthcare firm with unrivaled product and geographic diversity a bulletproof balance sheet a culture of capital discipline a strong pipeline of medicines and a stable consumer business made up of powerful brands such as tylenol moreover the remicade issues will probably take some time to play outjj isn’t overly reliant on any single product notes darren pollock a portfolio manager at cheviot value management it has been a consistent performer over decades “a profits machine” he says cheviot has added lately to a longstanding jj stake underlying trends remain strong adjusted for the dollar sales in the most recent two quarters were up a healthy  to  he points out deleterious currency effects should roll out of comparisons in the next  monthsin recent years jj has changed its pharma approach and become more nimble adds jack oliver managing partner at rbo investment management which has also added jj shares lately the company is more amenable to partnering on products instead of taking on the entire development cost and risk he saysjj’s valuation at a pe ratio of  times this year’s midpoint guidance of  is roughly in line with its historical average however relative to the market the shares trade near the bottom of their longterm rangethere should be no discount says pollock jj has more consistent cash flow better operating metrics a higher dividend yield and a stronger balance sheet than most companies in the market during the past  years jj’s valuation carried an average premium to the market of  he says pollock looks for a  stock at some point in the next three years which combined with a  dividend yield would be close to a doubledigit annual total return“jj is a tough company to bet against” says rbo’s oliver “if you have reasonable expectations in an aging bull market then jj stock works”the risk is that remicade biosimilars will be available in the us this year but it is more likely that challenges to the drug will be held up in courts for another  to  months remicade goes off patent in  in the meanwhile jj continues to develop its drug pipeline about which investors will learn more on may  when the company will give a pharmadivision outlookjj stock won’t shoot the lights out but it should outperform in a downturn and provide a stable but steady rise in a bull market what’s wrong
