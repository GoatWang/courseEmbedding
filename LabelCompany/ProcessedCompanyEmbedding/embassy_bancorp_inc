businessrelated deposits ﻿      embassy bancorp inc                                                                                                                             as for consumers deposit growth is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to population growth bank and nonbank competition local bank mergers and consolidations increase in household income interest rates accessibility of location and the sales efforts of company personnel time deposits can be attracted andor increased by paying an interest rate higher than that offered by competitors but they are the most costly type of deposit the most profitable type of deposits are noninterest bearing demand checking accounts which can be attracted by offering free checking however both high interest rates and

which is being repaid according to its original terms and is the most desirable type of loan that a bank seeks to make without loans a bank cannot generate enough earnings to be profitable the risk involved in each loan must therefore be carefully evaluated before the loan is made the interest rate at which the loan is made should always reflect the risk factors involved including the term of the loan the value of collateral if any the reliability of the projected source of repayment and the amount of the loan requested credit quality will always be the company’s most important factor ﻿

such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized moreover the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice ﻿ capital adequacy and operations ﻿ enacted in  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  “fdicia” contains

and officers fdicia also provided for expanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by such institutions’ primary federal banking regulator each primary federal banking regulator is required to specify by regulation capital standards for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions it supervises and depending upon the extent to which a depository institution does not meet such capital adequacy measures the primary federal banking regulator may prohibit such institution from paying dividends or may require such institution to take other steps to become adequately capitalized ﻿ fdicia established five capital tiers ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution is well capitalized if it significantly exceeds the minimum level required by regulation for each relevant capital measure under fdicia an institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market in addition “pass through” insurance coverage may not be available for certain employee benefit accounts fdicia also requires an undercapitalized depository institution to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency one requisite element of such a plan is that the institution’s parent holding company must guarantee compliance by the institution with the plan subject to certain limitations in the event of the parent holding company’s bankruptcy the guarantee and any other commitments that the parent holding company has made to federal bank regulators to maintain the capital of its depository institution

accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the company to make estimates and assumptions the company believes that its determination of the

selling costs at the date of acquisition or transfer and subsequently at the lower of its new cost or fair value less estimated selling costs  adjustments to the carrying value at the date of

estimated selling costs at which time a provision for loan losses on such real estate is charged to operations  appraisals are critical in determining the value of properties  overly optimistic

to   million at december      the significant growth in the company’s deposits resulted primarily from market disruption due to recent mergers of two regional banks   in the company’s market area and customers migrating to local community bank s additional deposit growth was achieved through a concentrated effort   to expand business relationships with local municipalities during the same period loans receivable net of the allowance for loan losses increased   million to   million at december   from   million at december    with a significant portion of such   loans originat ing in the fou r th quarter the market is very competitive and the company is committed to maintaining a high quality portfolio that returns a reasonable market rate the company expects increased lending activity as the company expands its presence in the market and continues to become more widely known  the past and current economic conditions have created lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers  the lending staff has been active in contacting new prospects and promoting the company’s name in the community management believes that this will translate into continued growth of a portfolio of quality loans and core deposit relationships although there can be no assurance of this the company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any future market rate adjustments ﻿ the company reported net income of   million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of   million for the year ended december    a decrease of  thousand or    diluted earnings per share decreased to   in  from   in    the difference in net income for the year ended december   and december   resulted in part from the

net interest income is the difference between income on assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets earning assets are composed primarily of loans and investments  interestbearing deposits and borrowings make up the cost of funds noninterest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid determine changes in net interest income the timing of deposit and loan growth also impacted net interest income  deposit and consumer loan growth

 was   million compared to   million for the year ended december      the increase in interest income is due to the growth in loan balances offset by lower yields in this interest rate environment  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to growth in savings and certificate of deposits due to the opening of the nazareth branch expansion of existing deposit relationships    growth in the number of deposit relationships with municipalities and significant growth in the number of accounts resulting from customer migration due to recent merger activity in the company’s local marketplace offset by a decrease in shortterm and longterm borrowings  net interest income increased   to   million for the year ended december   as compared to   million for the year ended december    ﻿ generally changes in net interest income are measured by net interest rate spread and net interest margin interest rate spread is the mathematical difference between the average interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities interest margin represents the net interest yield on earning assets and is derived by dividing net interest income by average earning assets the interest margin gives a reader a better indication of asset earning results when compared to peer groups or industry standards ﻿ the company’s net interest margin for the year ended december   was  compared t o  for the year ended december    the decrease in the margin is due primarily to the decrease in loan and investment rates and increase in certificate of deposit rates

resulting from a movement in market interest rates the company monitors rate sensitivity in order to reduce vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate capital levels and acceptable levels of liquidity the company’s assetliability management policy monthly and quarterly financial reports along with simulation modeling supplies management with guidelines to evaluate and manage rate sensitivity ﻿ gap a measure of the difference in volume between interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities is a means of monitoring the sensitivity of a financial institution to changes in interest rates the chart below provides an indicator of the rate sensitivity of the company now and savings accounts are categorized by their respective estimated decay rates the company is liability sensitive which means that if interest rates fall interest income will fall slower than interest expense and net interest income will likely increase if interest rates rise interest income will rise slower than interest expense and net interest income will likely decrease the company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and

inc                                                                                                                             not e  – summary of significant accounting policies ﻿ principles of consolidation and nature of operations ﻿ embassy bancorp inc the “company” is a pennsylvania corporation organized in  and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act of  as amended the “bhc act” the company was formed for purposes of acquiring embassy bank for the lehigh valley the “bank” in connection with the reorganization of the bank into a bank holding company structure which was consummated on november   accordingly the company owns all of the capital stock of the bank giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the company continues to grow ﻿ the bank which is the company’s principal operating subsidiary was originally incorporated as a pennsylvania bank on may   and opened its doors on november   it was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the lehigh valley area of pennsylvania the bank’s primary market area ﻿ estimates ﻿ the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses the valuation of other real estate owned and the valuation of deferred tax assets ﻿ concentrations of credit risk ﻿ most of the company’s activities are with customers located in the lehigh valley area of pennsylvania note  discuss es the types of securities in which the company invests the concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in note  the company does not have any significant concentrations to any one specific industry or customer with the exception of lending activity to a broad range of lessors of residential and nonresidential real estate within the lehigh valley although the company has a diversified loan portfolio its debtors’ ability to honor their contracts is influenced by the region’s economy ﻿ presentation of cash flows ﻿ for purposes of reporting cash flows cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand amounts due from banks interestbearing demand deposits with bank and federal funds sold generally federal funds are purchased or sold for less than one week periods ﻿ s ecurities ﻿ securities classified as available for sale are those securities that the company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily to maturity securities available for sale are carried at fair value any decision to sell a security classified as available for sale would be based on various factors including significant movement in interest rates changes in maturity mix of the company’s assets and liabilities liquidity needs regulatory capital considerations and other similar factors unrealized gains and losses are reported as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income realized gains or losses determined on the basis of the cost of the specific securities sold are included in earnings premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities ﻿ other than temporary accounting guidance specifies that a if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and b it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery the security would not be considered otherthantemporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss when an        embassy bancorp inc                                                                                                                             entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis it will recognize the credit component of an otherthantemporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income the company recognized no otherthantemporary impairment charges during the years ended december   and   ﻿ restricted investments in bank stock ﻿ restricted investments in bank stock consist of fhlbank pittsburgh “f hlb” stock and atlantic community   bankers bank “acbb” stock  the restricted stocks have no quoted market value and are carried at cost  federal law requires a member institution of the fhlb to hold stock of its district fhlb according to a predetermined formula ﻿ during  the fhlb conducted limited excess capital stock repurchases based upon positive quarterly net income in october  the fhlb amended its capital plan and created two subclasses of stock one required as a member “membership stock”  and  additional stock in the fhlb in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings “activitybased stock”  under this new plan the costs of membership decreased  as a result of this decrease  the fhlb began repurchasing excess stock on a regular monthly repurchase date and pay dividends if conditions warrant on a quarterly basis dividend payments of   thousand and   thousand were recei ved during the years ended december   and   respectively ﻿ management evaluates the fhlb and acbb restricted stock for impairment management’s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on their assessment of the ultimate recoverability of their cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value the determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of their cost is influenced by criteria such as  the significance of the decline in net assets of the issuer as compared to the capital stock amount for the issuer and the length of time this situation has persisted  commitments by the issuer to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the issuer and  the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and accordingly on the customer base of the issuer ﻿ management believes no impairment charge is necessary related to the fhlb or acbb restricted stock as of december    ﻿ loans receivable ﻿ loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal balances net of any deferred fees or costs interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance loan origination fees net of certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the yield using the effective interest method  premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method  delinquency fees are recognized in income when chargeable assuming collectability is reasonably assured ﻿ the loans receivable portfolio is segmented into commercial and consumer loans  commercial loans consist of the following classes commercial real estate commercial construction and commercial  consumer loans consist of the following classes residential real estate and other consumer loans ﻿ the company makes commercial loans for real estate development and other business purposes required by the customer base  the company’s credit policies determine advance rates against the different forms of collateral that can be pledged against commercial loans  typically the majority of loans will be limited to a percentage of their underlying collateral values such as real estate values equipment eligible accounts receivable and inventory  individual loan advance rates may be higher or lower depending upon the financial strength of the borrower andor term of the loan  the assets financed through commercial loans are used within the business for its ongoing operation  repayment of these kinds of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversion of assets  commercial real estate loans include longterm loans financing commercial properties  repayments of these loans are dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or        embassy bancorp inc                                                                                                                             lease of the subject property  commercial real estate loans typically require a loan to value ratio of not greater than  and vary in terms ﻿ residential mortgages and home equity loans are secured by the borrower’s residential real estate in either a first or second lien position  residential mortgages and home equity loans have varying interest rates fixed or variable depending on the financial condition of the borrower and the loan to value ratio  residential mortgages may have amortizations up to  years and home equity loans may have maturities up to  years  other consumer loans include installment loans car loans and overdraft lines of credit  some of these loans may be unsecured ﻿ for all classes of loans receivable the accrual of interest may be discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become  days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest even though the loan is currently performing  a loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured  when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed  interest received on nonaccrual loans including impaired loans generally is applied against principal  generally loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time generally six months and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt  the past due status of all classes of loans receivable is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments ﻿ allowance for loan losses ﻿ the allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans the reserve for unfunded loan commitments represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries loans or portions of loans determined to be confirmed losses are charged against the allowance account and subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the account a loss is considered confirmed when information available at the balance sheet date indicates the loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible ﻿ management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  the allowance is based on the company’s past loan loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio current economic conditions and other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available ﻿ management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level it believes adequate to absorb probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable incurred losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates the allowance for loan losses account consists of specific and general reserves the specific component consists of the specific reserve for impaired loans individually evaluated under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  “receivables” and the general component is utilized for loss contingencies on those loans collectively evaluated under fasb asc  “contingencies” ﻿ for the specific portion of the allowance for loan losses a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status ability to pay and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower including the length of the delay the reasons for the delay the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed loans considered impaired under fasb asc  are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the present        embassy bancorp inc                                                                                                                             value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent is less than the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest and net deferred loan fees or costs the company will recognize the impairment by adjusting the allowance for loan losses account through charges to earnings as a provision for loan losses ﻿ for loans secured by real estate estimated fair values are determined primarily through thirdparty appraisals  when a real estate secured loan becomes impaired a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary  this decision is based on various considerations including the age of the most recent appraisal loantovalue ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property  appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral which is considered to be the estimated fair value  the discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property ﻿ for commercial and industrial loans secured by nonreal estate collateral such as accounts receivable inventory and equipment estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower’s financial statements inventory reports accounts receivable aging or equipment appraisals or invoices indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets ﻿ the general portion of the allowance for loan losses covers pools of loans by major loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans such as residential real estate and other consumer loans loss contingencies for each of the major loan pools are determined by applying a total loss factor to the current balance outstanding for each individual pool the total loss factor is comprised of a historical loss factor using the loss migration method plus a qualitative factor which adjusts the historical loss factor for changes in trends conditions and other relevant factors that may affect repayment of the loans in these pools as of the evaluation date loss migration involves determining the percentage of each pool that is expected to ultimately result in loss based on historical loss experience historical loss factors are based on the ratio of net loans chargedoff to loans net for each of the major groups of loans evaluated and measured for impairment under fasb asc  the historical loss factor for each pool  includ e s but is not limited to an average of the company’s historical net chargeoff ratio for the most recent rolling twenty four quarters ﻿ in addition to these historical loss factors management also uses a qualitative factor that represents a number of environmental risks that may cause estimated credit losses associated with the current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience these environmental risks include i changes in lending policies and procedures including underwriting standards and collection chargeoff and recovery practices ii changes in the composition and volume of the portfolio iii changes in national local and industry conditions including the effects of such changes on the value of underlying collateral for collateraldependent loans iv changes in the volume and severity of classified loans including past due nonaccrual troubled debt restructures and other loan modifications v changes in the levels of and trends in chargeoffs and recoveries vi the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations vii changes in the experience ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff viii changes in the quality of the loan review system and the degree of oversight by the board of directors and ix the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current loan portfolio each environmental risk factor is assigned a value to reflect improving stable or declining conditions based on management’s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation ﻿ the unallocated component of the general allowance is used to cover inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date but which have not been identified as part of the allocated allowance using the above impairment evaluation methodology due to limitations in the process one such limitation is the imprecision of accurately estimating the impact current economic conditions will have on historical loss rates variations in the magnitude of impact may cause estimated credit losses associated with the current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience resulting in an allowance that is higher or lower than the anticipated level ﻿ the allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories  the borrower’s overall financial condition repayment sources guarantors and value of collateral if appropriate are evaluated annually for commercial loans or when credit deficiencies arise such as delinquent loan payment for        embassy bancorp inc                                                                                                                             commercial and consumer loans  credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention substandard doubtful and loss  loans criticized as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention  if uncorrected the potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects  loans classified substandard have a welldefined weakness and borrowers are highly leveraged  they include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and the paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any  loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full on the basis of current conditions and facts is highly improbable  loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses  loans not classified are rated pass ﻿ federal regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process periodically review the company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination which may not be currently available to management based on management’s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate ﻿ other real estate owned ﻿ other real estate owned is comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deedinlieu of foreclosure and loans classified as insubstance foreclosures  a loan is classified as an insubstance foreclosure when the company has taken possession of the collateral regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings take place other real estate owned is recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the time of acquisition any excess of the loan balance over the recorded value is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of acquisition  after foreclosure valuations are periodically performed and the assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell  changes in the valuation allowance on foreclosed assets are included in other income  costs to maintain the assets are included in other expenses any gain or loss realized upon disposal of other real estate owned is included in other income ﻿ bank owned life insurance ﻿ the company invests in bank owned life insurance “boli” as a tax deferred investment and a source of funding for employee benefit expenses  boli involves the purchasing of life insurance by the company on certain of its employees and directors  the company is the owner and beneficiary of the policies  this life insurance investment is carried at the cash surrender value of the underlying policies  income from increases in cash surrender value of the policies is included in noninterest income and is not subject to income taxes unless surrendered  the company does not intend to surrender these policies and accordingly no deferred taxes have been recorded on the earnings from these policies ﻿ premises and equipment   ﻿ premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed on the straightline method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets furniture fixtures and equipment for five to ten years leasehold improvements for ten to fifteen years computer equipment and data processing software for three to f ive years and automobiles for five years ﻿ transfers of financial assets ﻿ transfers of financial assets including sales of loan participations are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when  the assets have been isolated from the company  the transferee obtains the right free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and  the company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity        embassy bancorp inc                                                                                                                             advertising costs ﻿ the company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred ﻿ income taxes ﻿ income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense current and deferred  current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to taxable income  deferred income taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences  temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carry forwards and their tax basis deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment ﻿ earnings per share ﻿ basic earnings per share represents income available to common stockholders divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period as adjusted for stock dividends and splits diluted earnings per share reflect additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued as well as any adjustments to income that would result from the assumed issuance potential common shares that may be issued by the

current revenue recognition requirements in topic  revenue recognition the asu is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract in august  the fasb issued asu  which deferred the effective date of asu  by one year  the new guidance will be effective for public companies for periods beginning after december   with private companies provided a oneyear deferral until periods beginning after december   the asu permits application of the new revenue recognition guidance to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods the company has not yet determined which        embassy bancorp

standard on the financial statements if any   this guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments including loans securities and derivatives that are accounted for under other us gaap guidance for that reason the company does not expect it to have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations for elements of the statement of income associated with financial instruments including securities gains interest income and interest expense however the company does believe the new standard will result in new disclosure requirements the company currently in the process of reviewing contracts to assess the impact of the new guidance on our service offerings that are in the scope of the guidance included in noninterest income such as service charges and payment processing the company is continuing to evaluate the effect of the new guidance on revenue sources other than financial instruments on our financial position and consolidated results of

lease liability for all leases with a limited exception for shortterm leases leases will be classified as either finance or operating with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income currently leases are classified as either capital or operating with only capital leases recognized on the balance sheet the reporting of lease related expenses in the statements of operations and cash flows will be generally consistent with the current guidance the new guidance will be effective for years beginning after december   for public companies and for years beginning after december   for private companies once effective the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to the beginning of the earliest period presented the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on its con solidated financial statements ﻿ in june  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu”  financial instruments  credit losses asu  requires entities to report “expected” credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit rather than the current “incurred loss” model these expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts this asu will also require enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio these disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements for public business entities that are us securities and exchange commission filers the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years for all other public business entities the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years for all other entities the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december   the company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of asu  will have on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations  how ever due to the significant differences

obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities  under these arrangements the company may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the company to repurchase the assets  as a result these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements ie secured borrowings and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities  the obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the companys consolidated statements of condition while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts in other words there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities in addition as the company does not enter into reverse repurchase agreements there is no such offsetting to be done with the repurchase agreements ﻿ the right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing whereby the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the company be in default eg fails to make an interest payment to the counterparty for private institution repurchase agreements if the private institution counterparty were to default eg declare bankruptcy the company could cancel the repurchase agreement ie cease payment of principal and interest and attempt collection on the amount of collateral value in excess of the repurchase agreement fair value the collateral is held by a third party financial institution in the counterpartys custodial account the counterparty has the right to sell or repledge the investment securities for government entity repurchase agreements the

fair value of securities pledged was  million and    million respectively ﻿ ﻿ note    fair value of financial instruments ﻿ the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures  the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices however in many instances there are no quoted market prices for the company’s various financial instruments in cases where quoted market prices are not available fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques  those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows accordingly the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument ﻿ fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate in such instances determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment the fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions ﻿ asc topic  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under asc topic  are as follows ﻿ level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities ﻿ level   quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability ﻿ level   prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable ie supported with little or no market activity        embassy bancorp

estimate the fair values of the company’s financial instruments at december   and december    ﻿ cash and cash equivalents carried at cost the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash

amounts below the insured limit limiting the amount of credit risk on these time deposits ﻿ securities available for sale carried at fair value the fair value of securities available for sale are determined by matrix pricing level  which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices for these securities the company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service  the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes market spreads cash flows the us treasury yield curve live trading levels trade execution data market consensus prepayment speeds credit information and the security’s terms and conditions among other things ﻿ loans receivable carried at cost the fair values of loans excluding impaired loans carried at fair value of collateral are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using market rates at the balance sheet date that reflect the credit and interest raterisk inherent in the loans projected

n o significant change in credit risk fair values are based on carrying values ﻿ restricted investment in bank stock carried at cost the carrying amount of restricted investment in bank stock approximates fair value and considers the limited mark etability of such securities ﻿ accrued interest receivable and payable carried at cost the carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates its fair value ﻿ deposit liabilities carried at cost the fair values disclosed for demand deposits eg interest and noninterest checking passbook savings and money market accounts are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date ie their carrying amounts fair values for fixedrate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits ﻿ securities sold under agreements to repurchase and shortterm borrowings carried at cost these borrowings are short term and the carrying amount approximates the fair value ﻿ longterm borrowings carried at cost fair values of fhlb and univest advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on quoted prices for new fhlb and univest advances with similar credit risk characteristics terms and remaining maturity th ese prices obtained from this active market represent a market value that is deemed to represent the transfer price if the liability were assumed by a third party ﻿ offbalance
