freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples

 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification  this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions andor data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications andor translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does  you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the librarys complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee  you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section  above provided that you also meet all of these conditions •a the modified work must itself be a software library •b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change •c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license •d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely welldefined independent of the application therefore subsection d requires that any applicationsupplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license  you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version  instead of to this license if a newer version than version  of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library  you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section  in object code or executable form under the terms of sections  and  above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections  and  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code  a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section  states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section  otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section  any executables containing that work also fall under section  whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself  as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customers own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things •a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections  and  above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machinereadable work that uses the library as object code andor source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions •b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that  uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the users computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and  will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interfacecompatible with the version that the work was made with •c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution •d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place •e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute  you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library sidebyside in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things •a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above •b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work  you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance  you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it  each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license  if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the authordonor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license  if the distribution andor use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license  the free software foundation may publish revised andor new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation  if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty  because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders andor other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction  in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify andor redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even

messages to advise its subscriber that their telenav accounts have been activated generally these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for telenav services except for these activation confirmation messages telenav does not send any text messages on its own case  telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via telenavs short code address for example if john doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes he can send the address to his friend tom smith from within the telenav mobile device application when tom smith receives the message it will be sent from telenav incs short code but opening the message will reveal that john doe originated it in both case  and case  above the standard messaging rates charges imposed by the wireless carrier if any for delivering or accepting a message will apply ending message delivery every message sent via telenavs short code includes instructions to reply stop to stop future messages being sent on behalf of telenavs customers when telenav receives a stop message via a reply to its short code telenav is compelled by the mma guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent and to not deliver any further messages for any reason obtaining help if a message recipient wishes to get help on the telenav services to better explain why he received the message the recipient can send reply with help to the message or any other person can send help to the telenav short code  at any time telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the telenavcom web site restarting services if a recipient or any other person has sent stop cancel or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from telenavs short code to cease but later

 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification  this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions andor data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications andor translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does  you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the librarys complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee  you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section  above provided that you also meet all of these conditions •a the modified work must itself be a software library •b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change •c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license •d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely welldefined independent of the application therefore subsection d requires that any applicationsupplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license  you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version  instead of to this license if a newer version than version  of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library  you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section  in object code or executable form under the terms of sections  and  above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections  and  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code  a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section  states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section  otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section  any executables containing that work also fall under section  whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself  as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customers own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things •a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections  and  above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machinereadable work that uses the library as object code andor source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions •b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that  uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the users computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and  will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interfacecompatible with the version that the work was made with •c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution •d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place •e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute  you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library sidebyside in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things •a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above •b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work  you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance  you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it  each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license  if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the authordonor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license  if the distribution andor use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license  the free software foundation may publish revised andor new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation  if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty  because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders andor other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction  in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify andor redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even

sms telenav makes every effort to comply with the mobile marketing association mma consumer best practices guideline for the use of text messages for conducting its wordofmouth marketing campaign to review these guidelines go to httpwwwmmaglobalcomdocumentsbestpractices messages delieverd by telenav case  upon receiving activation notification from a wireless carrier telenav may send text messages to advise its subscriber that their telenav accounts have been activated generally these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for telenav services except for these activation confirmation messages telenav does not send any text messages on its own case  telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via telenavs short code address for example if john doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes he can send the address to his friend tom smith from within the telenav mobile device application when tom smith receives the message it will be sent from telenav incs short code but opening the message will reveal that john doe originated it in both case  and case  above the standard messaging rates charges imposed by the wireless carrier if any for delivering or accepting a message will apply ending message delivery every message sent via telenavs short code includes instructions to reply stop to stop future messages being sent on behalf of telenavs customers when telenav receives a stop message via a reply to its short code telenav is compelled by the mma guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent and to not deliver any further messages for any reason obtaining help if a message recipient wishes to get help on the telenav services to better explain why he received the message the recipient can send reply with help to the message or any other person can send help to the telenav short code  at any time telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the telenavcom web site restarting services if a recipient or any other person has sent stop cancel or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from telenavs short code to cease but later determines that he does want to receive messages from telenavs short code the party wishing to restart services should send restart as the subject of a text message to telenavs short code  other

 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification  this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions andor data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications andor translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does  you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the librarys complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee  you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section  above provided that you also meet all of these conditions •a the modified work must itself be a software library •b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change •c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license •d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely welldefined independent of the application therefore subsection d requires that any applicationsupplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license  you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version  instead of to this license if a newer version than version  of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library  you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section  in object code or executable form under the terms of sections  and  above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections  and  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code  a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section  states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section  otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section  any executables containing that work also fall under section  whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself  as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customers own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things •a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections  and  above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machinereadable work that uses the library as object code andor source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions •b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that  uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the users computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and  will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interfacecompatible with the version that the work was made with •c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution •d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place •e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute  you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library sidebyside in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things •a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above •b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work  you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance  you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it  each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license  if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the authordonor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license  if the distribution andor use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license  the free software foundation may publish revised andor new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation  if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty  because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders andor other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction  in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify andor redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even

 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification  this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions andor data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications andor translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does  you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the librarys complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee  you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section  above provided that you also meet all of these conditions •a the modified work must itself be a software library •b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change •c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license •d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely welldefined independent of the application therefore subsection d requires that any applicationsupplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license  you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version  instead of to this license if a newer version than version  of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library  you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section  in object code or executable form under the terms of sections  and  above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections  and  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code  a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section  states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section  otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section  any executables containing that work also fall under section  whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself  as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customers own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things •a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections  and  above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machinereadable work that uses the library as object code andor source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions •b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that  uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the users computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and  will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interfacecompatible with the version that the work was made with •c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution •d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place •e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute  you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library sidebyside in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things •a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above •b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work  you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance  you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it  each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license  if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the authordonor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license  if the distribution andor use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license  the free software foundation may publish revised andor new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation  if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty  because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders andor other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction  in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify andor redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even

messages to advise its subscriber that their telenav accounts have been activated generally these messages are sent via the messaging gateway owned by the wireless carrier that provisioned the order for telenav services except for these activation confirmation messages telenav does not send any text messages on its own case  telenav allows its mobile device application subscribers to share addresses and other relevant content with other parties using text messaging via telenavs short code address for example if john doe wants to share the address of a new club he likes he can send the address to his friend tom smith from within the telenav mobile device application when tom smith receives the message it will be sent from telenav incs short code but opening the message will reveal that john doe originated it in both case  and case  above the standard messaging rates charges imposed by the wireless carrier if any for delivering or accepting a message will apply ending message delivery every message sent via telenavs short code includes instructions to reply stop to stop future messages being sent on behalf of telenavs customers when telenav receives a stop message via a reply to its short code telenav is compelled by the mma guidelines to inform the recipient of the original message that no additional messages will be sent and to not deliver any further messages for any reason obtaining help if a message recipient wishes to get help on the telenav services to better explain why he received the message the recipient can send reply with help to the message or any other person can send help to the telenav short code  at any time telenav will respond with a message that directs the sender to this portion of the telenavcom web site restarting services if a recipient or any other person has sent stop cancel or any other word that could be reasonably interpreted as meaning the recipient wanted text messages from telenavs short code to cease but later

 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification  this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions andor data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications andor translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does  you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the librarys complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee  you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section  above provided that you also meet all of these conditions •a the modified work must itself be a software library •b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change •c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license •d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely welldefined independent of the application therefore subsection d requires that any applicationsupplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license  you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version  instead of to this license if a newer version than version  of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library  you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section  in object code or executable form under the terms of sections  and  above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections  and  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code  a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section  states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section  otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section  any executables containing that work also fall under section  whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself  as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customers own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things •a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections  and  above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machinereadable work that uses the library as object code andor source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions •b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that  uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the users computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and  will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interfacecompatible with the version that the work was made with •c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution •d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place •e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute  you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library sidebyside in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things •a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above •b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work  you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance  you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it  each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license  if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the authordonor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license  if the distribution andor use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license  the free software foundation may publish revised andor new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation  if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty  because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders andor other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction  in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify andor redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even
