pdf iframe viewer qc test newphase™ menu drilling fluid systemsdrilling fluid productsdrilling challengesregionsabout uscontact us contact us about newphase™ product description newphase™ water activity control agent is a proprietary blend of polyglycerols that replace the brine in the internal phase of invert emulsion drilling fluids internal phases of traditional invert emulsion systems are brines made with calcium chloride or other salts the emulsified brine prevents hydration of troublesome shale formations by maintaining the drilling fluid water activity less than or equal to the water activity of the shale however the brines limit disposal options and decrease lubricity of the fluid by replacing calcium chloride or other salts to control water vapor activity newphase water activity control agent provides a saltfree internal water phase it is formulated specifically to provide precise activity control in newpark’s proprietary saltfree optiphase™ diesel or mineral oilbased drilling fluid system it is  soluble in any type of water regardless of its salinity it contains no aromatics or oils and will not produce a sheen benefits the environmentally friendly newphase additive minimizes wellbore shale hydration by optimizing water phase activity it forms a semipermeable membrane across shale surfaces to strengthen the wellbore and inhibit drilling fluid ionic exchange with formation clays in addition newphase solutions are more lubricious than brine therefore optiphase performance exceeds traditional invert emulsions with higher rates of penetration and improved wellbore stability optiphase saltfree formulations may provide the operator with widened alternatives for disposal of fluid and cuttings while also protecting the environment when these biodegradable nontoxic systems are formulated with a lowaromatic base oil the health and safety risks associated with invert emulsion systems are minimized application newphase water activity control agent is used in any invert emulsion system regardless of the base oil used or the salinity of the internal water phase it is particularly applicable when operational demands require improved performance through increased wellbore stability lubricity and rates of penetration or when health safety and environmental demands require reduced chlorides and liabilities in addition because the density of a newphase solution is less than that of a brine with the same water activity the optiphase system may be chosen when the absolute lowest possible mud weight is required the newphase additive can also be used to reduce “stickslip” behavior in conventional invert emulsion systems treatment recommendation the system’s water phase should not exceed  for maximum effectiveness example in a  ow ratio fluid newphase additive should comprise  of the internal phase to achieve a water activity less than or equal to   internal phase x  newphase additive this approximates an internal phase consisting of two parts newphase additive to one part water typical physical properties appearance dark viscous liquid flash point °f °c specific gravity   lbgal handling and storage avoid
