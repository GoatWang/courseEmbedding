and yoojin kim sisters from korea net the biggest deal in shark tank history as all  sharks teamed up to seed the company with an a staggering  million dollars in just a short  months their product has completely disrupted the mens health industry in korean and with the help of the sharks they are now ready to take over the world market after a complete rebrand and repackaging the sisters are now ready to launch their new brand test boost excel in the united states see the amazing demonstration below that got the sharks ready to feed instantly apparently the kim sisters have invented a new chemical compound that boosts testosterone production in men particularly men over  the average age in which testosterone has been shown to naturally diminish while there are a number of supplements on the market that are claiming to boost testosterone the kim sisters have created the first reuptake inhibitor ri making it particularly more effective at permanently retaining testosterone ris work by blocking the inhibiting the plasmalemmal transportermediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from the synapse into the presynaptic neuron what this means to men without a doctorate in chemistry a permanent cure for erectile dysfunction robert this is an industry that has been desperate for a cure for so long im thrilled to be working with the kim sisters and am looking forward to scaling production the mens health industry is a massive market but its seldom reported on studies show that the majority of men over the age of  have had experiences with erectile dysfunction and a shocking  of all men are unhappy with their size there is obviously a huge potential for the sharks to profit but does the pill actually work we decided to put it to the test in order to test the veracity of the kim sisters product fox news needed a reporter to try it out as a wife of  years to a husband who has been struggling with erectile dysfunction i decided to volunteer what did i have to lose after i placed my order a few days later the pills arrived at my house i couldn’t wait for us to get to bed — before he fell asleep i gave him a pill saying that it was just a vitamin i’m kind of uncomfortable telling you about our crazy amazing experience but… since we’ll never meet offline ill tell you the details in less than an hour my husband woke up with a super stiff erection and believe me when i say we banged for  hour and  minutes straight thats no exaggeration his cock was so hard and ive never had an orgasm like that ever we were both able to achieve multiple orgasms that night there was tons screaming and a lot of sweat i had the perfect ride the best i’ve ever had i was finally satisfied and he was too i expected the pill to work but this was way more than i had expected what was our result the sharks had said that these pills were designed to increased mens size and that’s exactly what happened with my hubby i still find it hard to believe that this stuff turned him into a long strong wild beast in bed — and all for the price of a movie ticket and without any expensive prescription i find the results to be worth every penny i already ordered three more packs — life is too valuable and i’m not the kind of girl that skimps on pleasures so i can definitely recommend these amazing test boost excel for anyone who wants to last longer in bed and for anyone who wants to improve their size don’t hesitate to use that sample offer of test boost excel and make sure you take it because now i’m finally satisfied on top of my hubby’s erections being on point he is now way bigger than before and lasts way longer than ever before when we use it when reached for comment the sharks graciously provided fox news with their promotional package a limited selection of free samples of test boost excel note please only sign up for one free sample per household we have a limited number of free bottles trial bottles running out fast claim now before stock
