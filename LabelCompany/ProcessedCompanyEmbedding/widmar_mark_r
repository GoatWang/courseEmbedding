welcome to first solars first quarter  earnings call this call is being webcast live on the investors section of first solars website at firstsolarcom at this time all participants are in listenonly mode as a reminder todays call is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to steve haymore from first solar investor relations mr haymore you may begin stephen haymore  first solar inc thank you good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter  financial results a copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the investors section of first solars website at firstsolarcom with me today are mark widmar chief executive officer and alex bradley chief financial officer mark will provide a business and technology update then alex will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for  we will then open up the call for questions most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on todays call are based on us generally accepted accounting principles in the few cases where we report nongaap measures such as free cash flow adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income or nongaap eps we have reconciled the nongaap measures to the corresponding gaap measures at the back of our presentation please note this call will include forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from managements current expectations we encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in todays press release and presentation for a more complete description it is now my pleasure to introduce mark widmar chief executive officer mark mark r widmar  first solar inc thanks steve good afternoon and thank you for joining our call today ill begin by briefly reviewing our results for the first quarter before providing an update on our series  progress and developments in our business our first quarter results were a good start to the year with the sale of our moapa project closing and receipt of the remaining cash from the transaction our nongaap eps of  was above our guidance which is a noteworthy accomplishment in a very challenging market environment we ended the quarter with  billion in net cash which further differentiates the strength of our balance sheet from our competitors as we remain true to our balanced business model philosophy of growth profitability and liquidity alex will provide more color on our financial results later in his remarks as indicated on our last earnings call we are carefully planning all aspects of the series  launch to ensure both technological and commercial readiness on our last call we focused on the technology today we will provide an update on our commercial preparation to ensure a successful market launch of our series  product keep in mind that with over  gigawatts of modules produced first solars technology is well understood and has been installed in projects worldwide our customers have trust in our technology product quality and financial strength however given the change in the module form factor as we move to series  we are making the necessary preparations to ensure a smooth product launch turning to slide  ill discuss some of our commercial readiness efforts firstly as it relates to enabling the ecosystem around series  our primary goal is to ensure our costeffective compatibility with our customers preferred structure providers since we made the decision last year to accelerate our series  product we have been collaborating with leading domestic and global structure providers epc contractors and pv engineering firms to evaluate and optimize the series  mounting interface for a wide variety of applications the learnings from this collaboration coupled with the module height that is the same as the  cell crystalline silicon module and a module frame that facilitates rapid installation gives us confidence in the competitive installation cost of our series  product weve also been evaluating the mechanical design and installation features of our series  models at our mesa arizona test site where weve installed more than half a dozen structures from leading suppliers a thirdparty contractor has completed trial installations of series  prototypes and the various structure types including sidebyside trials with competing  cell crystalline silicon modes weve been careful analyzing various installation means and methods focused on optimizing installation velocity and minimizing labor hours the initial results from this work are very positive and indicate that series  is compatible with existing leading structure designs and can be expected to have favorable installation hours per megawatt installed versus  cell crystalline silicon models beyond our efforts to ensure a seamless mechanical integration of series  were also validating the electrical bos design elements we have been carefully listing to the voice of our ecosystem partners understanding their needs and incorporating their feedback to ensure the most efficient designs at a lowest possible cost to validate our internal electrical bos analysis and testing weve engaged two independent engineering firms to provide their assessment of the expected cost of series  electrical bos components and associated labor in both case the independent analysis supports our internal projections the analysis also supports our belief that due to a shorter string length series  provides greater layout optimization and siting flexibility in addition to our own analysis thirdparty epcs and customers have been viewing series  installation demonstrations at the mesa test site as they develop their own assessment of the installation process and costs epc have also begun conducting their own installation trials at the mesa site to gain handson experience and increased familiarity with series  based on their evaluation and analysis several epcs have already provided quotes that further support that series  bos cost is expected to be similar to or better than competing crystalline silicon products over the next few months were expanding these trials to several international locations which will provide greater access to international epcs and will help ensure that series  is supported by a costefficient mechanical electrical and epc ecosystem in all key global markets as highlighted on slide  engaging directly with our customers to both educate them on series  and to solicit their feedback on the product is among our highest priorities with these objectives in mind we have recently hosted more than  of our customers at a conference in arizona that included attendance from leading ipps developers utilities epcs and ecosystem partners customers will provide an early product information and have the opportunity to attend demonstrations of series  module prototype installations customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive with over  of our customers indicating they were likely to purchase series  these are positive first steps and while theres still more work to be done especially internationally we are pleased with how series  has been embraced by our customers in short the testing performed with our ecosystem partners and voice of the customer feedback received have reinforced our view that series  eliminates the balance of system cost disadvantages associated with our smaller form factors series  module our module technology will now be able to leverage its advantaged attributes including superior temperature coefficient and spectral response unencumbered by higher balance of system cost turning to slide six ill provide a brief update on our series  technology and manufacturing milestones overall we continue to be very pleased with the progress we are making on the series  technology and manufacturing platform since our last earnings call we have ramped down production on eight lines or approximately onethird of our series  manufacturing out of malaysia factory this timing aligns with the milestones that weve provided in our february call the space is undergoing preparation for the delivery of series  equipment which is scheduled later this year in addition we now have all of the production tools ordered for ohio in our first malaysia factory over the next major – our next major milestone the arrival in the third quarter of  of our first tools to our ohio factory remains on track we will provide further updates on our q earnings call turning to slide seven ill provide an update on our future expected module shipments from the time of our last earnings call approximately nine weeks ago we have booked over  megawatts of thirdparty module sales bringing our total yeartodate bookings to nearly  megawatts dc the geographical mix of our recent module bookings is primarily asia pacific and europe after deducting yeartodate shipments through march of approximately  megawatts our remaining expected shipments now stand at  gigawatts dc on slide eight weve provided an updated view of our remaining series  supply as indicated previously our remaining series  supply will range between  and  gigawatts depending on when we see series  production at our ohio plant we will continue to evaluate this decision over the course of the year of the anticipated  to  gigawatts of series  supply across  and  we have already shipped approximately  megawatts and we have an additional  gigawatts of volume on the contract leaving us with the remaining supply of between  and  gigawatts relative to the prior quarter and based on updated construction schedules we have reduced the allocation of series  supply to our own capital development projects by approximately  megawatts this is a result of a shift in module allocation to series  uncertain of our captive projects this decision is expected to result in meaningful improvement in the overall gross margin of these projects while the pace of our bookings over the past two months is slower than the start of the year we are encouraged by the growth in our mid to latestage bookings opportunities shown on slide nine since our last earnings call bookings opportunity have grown to  gigawatts dc an increase of approximately  megawatts roughly twothirds of the total  gigawatts of opportunities are for series  shipments notably of the approximately  gigawatts of series  opportunities there are approximately  gigawatt of projects that are in late stage negotiations in some cases we have signed module supply agreements but are waiting for other conditions precedent including project financial close our letter of credit before recognizing these bookings we expect much of this volume to book in the second and third quarter given the status of these projects and the other mid to latestage opportunities we feel that were in a good position to sell through the remaining series  supply in addition we have a much larger number of earlystage opportunities not included in this view which helps increase our confidence lastly as we announced recently we are evaluating alternatives for the sale of our interest at point this is a result of several factors firstly in the future we anticipate selling projects primarily in the us prior to cod as the solar industry has matured the impact of project value of selling to fntp or shortly thereafter versus that cod is de minimis in fact in some cases value is enhanced with an earlier sale as this allows the buyer greater degrees of freedom to optimize the structuring of tax equity and project debt secondly recycling capital more quickly allows us to potentially invest in more project development opportunities as we do this we remain focused on our targeted development markets where we see the most opportunity finally we remain focused on series  and prioritizing investments in series  manufacturing capacity which we believe has the potential to provide a high return on invested capital as we continuously evaluate our business model these important considerations led us to determination to explore strategic alternatives for the sale of our interest in point alex will now provide more detail on our first quarter  financial results and discuss updated guidance for  alex alexander r bradley  first solar inc thanks mark so beginning on slide  ill touch briefly on the operational results of our series  product in the past quarter module production was  megawatts dc in the first quarter a decrease of  from the prior quarter due to nearly a full quarter of stopped production on four lines in ohio that began ramping down late last year to prepare the series  production capacity utilization increased to  in q versus  in the fourth quarter the fourth quarter utilization was lower as it included the four lines that were ramped down note that as we ramp down series  production the utilization metric will be subject to increased fluctuation and therefore somewhat less meaningful in part this is why we introduced the remaining series  supply metric which provides a more relevant metric during the ramp down module conversion efficiency for the full fleet averaged  in the first quarter an increase of  basis points versus q  conversion efficiency on our best line for the full quarter improved  basis points to  as compared to the prior quarter our best line exited the third quarter at over  continuing to slide  ill review some of the income statement highlights for q  in reviewing our income statement results ill also be discussing certain nongaap measures such as adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income and nongaap earnings per share please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the accompanying gaap to nongaap reconciliations additionally weve elected earlier to adopt asu  the new revenue standard which provides common revenue recognition guidance between gaap and ifrs the adoption of the standard generally requires us to recognize revenue and profit from our systems business sales in a more linear fashion in our historical practice our previously reported financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this standard adoption and more information is available in our press release and in our pending q filing in reviewing our financial results comparisons to the fourth quarter will reflect any applicable revisions from this change net sales were  million an increase of  million compared to the prior quarter the increase in net sales resulted primarily from the sale of the moapa projects with the entire revenue from the project recognized in the quarter higher revenue from the moapa sale was partially offset by  million decrease in module sales the closing of the moapa sale is a significant milestone given the size and complexity of the project and its also an important component of our  guidance as a percentage of total quarterly net sales of solar power systems revenue which includes both our epc revenue and solar modules used in systems projects increased to  from  in q as a result of the moapa sale and lower thirdparty module sales gross margin for the first quarter was  compared to  in the prior quarter the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily a result of project impairment in q to put the q gross margin in context keep in mind that our prior comments on the moapa project that was acquired in latestage development we therefore paid a significant development premium for the project as a result of this and certain developments and construction challenges specific to the project the gross margin of the project is not representative of what we would expect from a typical development project sale the gross margin of our component segment was  in q compared to  in the prior quarter the sequential increase here was primarily due to the impact of certain charges associated with our project impairments in q operating expenses excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges was  million in the first quarter versus q adjusted opex of  million  million sequential decrease as a result of the impact of our previously implemented restructuring actions and also an  million decrease in project impairment charges restructuring and asset impairment charges to accelerate our series  transition were  million in q compared to  million in the prior quarter the charge relates to series  and series  equipments and severance related to the ramp down of certain series  production lines excluding restructuringrelated items operating income in the first quarter was  million compared to an adjusted operating loss of  million in q the increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to higher sales lower project impairment charges and a decrease in operating expenses on a gaap basis our operating loss for the quarter was  million other income for the quarter was  million primarily resulting from the settlement of an outstanding matter with a former customer the cash associated with the settlement was also received in q we had tax expense of  million in the first quarter compared to  million of tax expense in q as a reminder the prior quarter tax expense is significantly higher due to predominantly noncash tax expense of  million associated with the distribution of approximately  million of cash to the us from a foreign subsidiary the prior quarter tax expense was partially offset by a tax benefit from restructuring charges first quarter eps was  on a gaap basis and excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges  on a nongaap basis relative to our expectations to q eps was higher due to betterthanexpected profit from the moapa project sale and the timing of a settlement of the former customer which was not expected in q in addition this settlement was contemplated on our previous guidance to potentially benefit operating income rather than other income ill next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information on slide  our cash and multiple securities balance ended the first quarter at over  billion an increase of approximately  million from q our net cash position improved by  million to nearly  billion as we received the final payments for our moapa and east pecos project our q net working capital which includes the change in noncurrent project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities decreased by  million the change was primarily due to a net reduction in projects assets and deferred revenue from the sale of the moapa project total debt was  million in the first quarter an increase of  million from the prior quarter the increase mainly resulted from issuing nonrecourse project level debt for projects in japan india and australia cash flows from operations were  million in q versus cash flows from operations of  million in the fourth quarter free cash flow was  million compared to free cash flow of  million last quarter capital expenditures were  million compared to  million in the prior quarter turning to slide  ill review updated full year  guidance in terms of assumptions underlying our guidance as we indicated last quarter the adoption of new revenue standards not have a significant impact on the net sales range weve already provided however as mentioned previously and ive seen with the updates in that sales guidance in our previous call associated with structuring of the moapa project the final structuring of project sales later this year may have future impact to our net sales guidance as it relates to project sales during the remainder of the year were pleased with the progress of making the sale of  megawatts ac switch station project were in advanced stage of the sale process and expect to close the transaction in q or q of this year the california flats and cuyama projects have been offered to point and are under review by the partnership if point is not able to acquire these projects we anticipate having sufficient thirdparty demand to sell these projects this year turning now to the guidance ranges as a result of improved visibility in the certain project sales we are raising our net sales guidance by  million to a revised range of  billion to  billion were raising our gross margin percentage of  basis points to a revised range of  to  as a result of the improved operational performance better project sale visibility and as a result of the movement of certain expenses previously forecast as cost of sales which are now expected to be treated as plant startup costs within operating expense our opex guidance increased by  million for both gaap and nongaap as a result of the revised plant startup previously mentioned for gaap operating expenses this  million increase was partially offset by a  million decrease in expected restructuring and asset impairment charges the revised restructuring range is now  million to  million of which  million was incurred in the first quarter the downward revision to the range resulted from ongoing supply negotiations which reduce the potential remaining liability were raising our eps guidance by  based on our operational performance and in anticipation of better economic value from certain project sales our revised nongaap eps range is now  to  and our gaap eps range has been revised to a loss of  up to  a profit the change in gaap eps is a result both of the fact as leading to the increase in the nongaap eps combined with lower expected restructuring charges note that our guidance includes expected net interest expense of  million to  million and minimal contribution from equity and earnings we also anticipate minimal other income or expense for the balance of the year in terms of a quarterly distribution of our nongaap earnings we currently expect second quarter earnings to be approximately breakeven however the timing of the sale of the switch station project currently forecasted in q could materially increase second quarter earnings we have previously anticipated a loss in the first half of the year however our operational performance including improved module cost per watt and improving outlook for the system sale business have resulted in a change to our outlook as it relates to our guidance for certain catalyst that may lead us to further raise our eps expectations for the remainder of the year including further improved visibility into sales system projects additionally as part of our ongoing tax funding assets we may record an income tax benefit of up to  million  in the second quarter as this benefit is still subject to acceptance by tax authorities we have not yet incorporated this into our guidance and will do so when and to the extent the matter is finalized related to our net cash and operating cash flow guidance our expected ranges of both increased by  million the increase is a combination of higher revenue improved module cost per watt improved systems business margins improved working capital management and lower restructuring charges ill now summarize our first quarter  progress on slide  we had solid financial results for the quarter net sales of  million and nongaap eps of  our ending cash was over  billion with  billion of net cash we raised the midpoint of our gaap eps by nearly  and our nongaap eps by  our series  module efficiency remains solid with a fleet full average of  a lead line efficiency of  in q our outlook for  bookings is strong with nearly  megawatts booked here to date and mid to latestage opportunities of  gigawatts our series  transition is progressing well and were making the necessary preparations to ensure a successful product launch we have now ordered all of the tools for both our ohio and malaysia factories in addition the first series  tools are on track to arrive at our ohio factory in q and lastly were pleased with the positive response from our customers and ecosystem partners to the series  products with that we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator and we will take our first one from brian lee of goldman sachs brian lee  goldman sachs  co hey guys thanks for taking the question i guess if you assume the point strategic process results in more capital to deploy i know thats an assumption at this point but how should we be thinking about priorities are you looking to fasttrack series  do you build more capacity than the current base case or would it be something else just trying to get a sense for what the uses of capital would be and then i have a followup alexander r bradley  first solar inc yeah so brian clearly the liquidity position is strong today and weve made a strategic decision to maintain both an unlevered balance sheet and a net cash position given cyclicality in the solar industry the business is in a transition period between series  and series  which is capitalintensive and we intend to grow that series  capacity from a position of strength so in terms of how we think about capital we really look to award full of cash needs and opportunities so firstly we fund our operations secondly we look to invest in manufacturing capacity thats both the current series  announced capacity and then the ability to grow beyond that as the more opportunity presents we look to fund the development business and that includes longterm systems opportunities relative – that provides incremental returns relative to the module business and relative to the riskadjusted cost of capital associated with those projects after that we look at ma and thats post the sale of existing assets investments and also opportunities to invest in other growth opportunities so we continue to look at synergistic ma opportunities both around the technology and around project development and then finally on top of that we make sure we have an adequate buffer to provide liquidity through cyclicality in the industry volatility so once you go through all of those we look to prioritize our capital and see where we can use it assuming at that point we had excess capital which we didnt leave could be accretively deployed in business then we look to return that capital to shareholders so thats an ongoing analysis and well obviously continue to monitor the capital and liquidity position as we move through the series  transition and through other events this year including the sale of point and the systems business sales the other thing that we take into account is geographically about half of our cash sits offshore and is subsequently invested offshore should we have any tax reform or anything else that impacts the ability to use that cash that would obviously play into the calculation as well brian lee  goldman sachs  co okay okay great fair enough appreciate the color second question i guess this is obviously kind of frontandcenter topic im sure theres going to be a number of questions around this but can you guys speak to the section  request from one of your manufacturing peers in the us i guess id be curious to know if its impacting your approach to booking the remaining series  capacity you outlined and then with respect to series  and then if your current contracted bookings have any contingencies that would allow for pricing to be recalibrated and then lastly with respect to series  how this potentially factors into your thinking around timing investment and then just the general strategy there thank you mark r widmar  first solar inc all right brian theres a lot there so ill try to – hopefully i got most of your questions first off as it relates to the tier  case were obviously very aware of it were looking closely at the filing clearly i think the spirit of the reason for the filing is rooted in the fact that theres clearly an oversupply in this industry and we believe that really is an issue and we also believe that there is a need for free and fair trade and theres also a need for enforcement around that so all that i think provides a undertone of the merits of what the case relates to as you also know that thinfilm is not included its not included in the criteria of the basis of what the case is currently structured for which would exclude not only our production here obviously in the us but obviously our production outside of the us currently in malaysia and then ultimately into vietnam as it relates to our strategy were going to continue to move forward were going to continue to address the market were going to continue to provide high value to our customers in the best possible product in the marketplace whether its series  or whether its series  well enter into our contracts a lot of the obligations that are in those contracts we are not structuring contracts for the most part that would enable some form of a repricing but if the case were to creates some merit and if we now have again a different view of where the market  price is for crystalline silicon that could inform our views a little bit around how we think about our pricing strategy for both series  and series  but thats clearly off into the future as it relates to our view around manufacturing capacity and where we think about series  our commitments still is the priorities that we talked about before for perrysburg then malaysia and then vietnam weve also highlighted though that we have flexibility in the toolset that were currently installing in ohio that could allow us some optionality of increasing capacity of series  in perrysburg and wed look to this maybe as one factor that would inform our decision around that the other would be id argue that corporate tax rate would be another one that would inform our – us corporate tax rate would inform our view around adding incremental capacity into our facility in ohio so theres a lot of moving pieces were going to continue to assess and evaluate and again i think the whole fundamental issue though that we shall be focused on is were very happy with where we are with our launch of series  thats in great position this trade case or other issues that may arise from it may also inform our view of little bit around how long we continue to produce in perrysburg weve highlighted that our current view is weve optionality of maybe pulling a couple of hundred megawatts out which really is there to facilitate the transition into series  to the extent there is some traction around this case we may continue to produce that  megawatt maybe not only through  but beyond  if need may be alexander r bradley  first solar inc brian with regards to series  timing were already on a pretty aggressive schedule there so i dont see that changes as mark said we have flexibility around the series  supply to keep that going longer should we need it operator and well take our next question from philip shen of roth capital partners philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc hi thanks for the questions as a followup on the section  topic if the section  gets implemented do you see any changes to your production plans for  for example would you move to produce either more or less of series  or series  than you had previously indicated and could you sell the series  externally in  versus prior plans of keeping i believe most of it inhouse mark r widmar  first solar inc phil i think i sort of alluded to a little bit in my comments to brians question but it really did – other than the timing of when we would actually wind down our production of series  in perrysburg it really doesnt inform our views beyond that in  now if the trade case were to get some traction could we look to continue producing some series  in perrysburg as an example potentially again the other thing but again its a longer date of horizon depending on what happens with this case we have the optionality of adding incremental capacity in perrysburg if need be again the toolset accommodates production volume that is closer to  gigawatts versus the currently planned  megawatts so a lot there to be evaluated but i think were very early i mean obviously as you know the trade case was just filed here recently a lot will happen and evolve over the next months and quarters and as we get a clear picture of what direction its going we have options and decisions that will make at that point in time operator and we will take our next question from krish sankar of bank of america krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch yeah hi thanks for taking my question i have two of them first one if the california flats and moapa projects do get sold to point or a third party is that in your forecast for this year a – gme mark widmar so the moapa project has already been completed and thats in the q revenue the california flats project is assumed to be sold this year now whether it goes to point or to another third party it is going to dependent on points appetite ability to acquire that project so the partnership and point is currently reviewing that asset the indication i would given the capital requirements to acquire that point is likely not going to do so but if thats the case were going to sell it to a third party but the value of that project is in our guidance for the year timing remains a little uncertain the other project that is in that perhaps youre thinking of this is a switch project so thats in our numbers for the year and were assuming comes in q although there is a chance that could accelerate into q operator and our next question comes from vishal shah of deutsche bank vishal b shah  deutsche bank securities inc yeah hi thanks for taking my question so i have two questions one is can you just clarify the comments you made on production output of series  in  do you say  megawatts or could it be up to a  gigawatt of output in  and then as far as the cash balance is concerned i think you had previously said that your cash distribution is going to net cash could go down until q q of next year is that still the case or do you expect cash to improve over the next couple of quarters thank you a – gme mark widmar on the series  production let makes sure im clear on that and ill let alex to take the cash question but series  what i had – what the  megawatts represented  megawatts is the fully ramp capacity that were currently are planning in our perrysburg facility all right and we wont actually start producing in perrysburg until the middle of next year so we wont have a full year output from perrysburg but in aggregate across perrysburg across klm for example our malaysia facility we anticipate to have a little bit north of around  gigawatts maybe a little bit north of a gigawatt production of series  in  again with that all that production largely happening in the second half of  alexander r bradley  first solar inc yes on the cash side so we raised on net cash guidance by  million so  billion to  billion for the end of this year and thats including the capex were planning on spending for the year so  million to  million of which we spent a little over  million in the first quarter so were on track on the capex side the cash balance for the end of the year will go up slightly relative to previous guidance we havent guided to be on that but we will continue to spend capex through to  and as weve mentioned before  when we started with series  product in q and q its the time that product is going to be most challenged relative to the competition given that were no longer investing in the development of series  as we focus on series  so we havent guided out to a number but we would expect to continue to spend capex all the series  transition through  but were obviously going to end the year with a very robust cash balance and the cash guidance that number were giving here through the end of the year doesnt include any proceeds from point operator and we will take our next question from andrew hughes of credit suisse andrew hughes  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hey guys good afternoon congrats on the quarter i had a question on moapa and guidance and then one of tax equity if you dont mind just on the moapa result can you give us a sense of what drove better margins was it pricing or more of the internal transfer costs and then as you look ahead to projects for the rest of the year i mean what has improved on the pricing front for you guys and as a result might we see a shift in the business mix back more to systems from modules it seems to be emphasized under series  alexander r bradley  first solar inc yes so on the moapa side we saw a slight uptick on the value its not significant but you got to remember when were guiding to relatively low eps numbers this year relative to the past even small movements in project value can change the overall outlook pretty significantly when we think about future systems values and were currently negotiating with the sale of our switch assets so we have a good sense how the market looks there and we have had a lot of unsolicited proposals for other assets in our pipeline from very credible counter parties i think the dynamic youre seeing here are there are few largescale quality assets in  and also into  and thats leading to very robust demand and better pricing in the market so were seeing that dynamics flow through and thats giving us confidence in the rest of this year in the system side as it relates to moving back to more development weve always maintained that we will continue to develop in the us and in select other markets where that makes sense on a longterm runrate basis we would expect to have potentially a gigawatt of development in the shortterm that maybe significantly higher proportion of that as we get through the existing pipeline that we have in the us and internationally in   and  as we go beyond that when we grow the series  volume i would still expect us to expand into more moduleonly sales as a percentage of the total manufacturing capacity that we have but well continue to monitor systems business and if it makes sense as we said on the question around cash usage were very happy to invest in development if we believe theres accretive return above and beyond the module business adjusted for the risk profile we are taking mark r widmar  first solar inc yeah i was wondering  to get that question and hopefully we can try to make ourselves clear but sometimes it keeps coming back to that same view weve never said that we will not continue to do development weve always said that were going to continue to do development well do development in the markets which we believe that we can capture inherent value and that we have core competency and differentiation potentially or capabilities that enables us to get appropriate return on capital and us clearly being one of them so development is a core part of our strategy it would be part of the value chain in which we look to participate not only here in the us but in asia india apac japan those markets will clearly be regions which well continue to focus on the other thing i want to make sure is also understood is the – part of the reason here is particularly in the us is we are starting to see more of a market opportunity for utility owned generation and i still do believe that in the us the ultimate owner of these assets will potentially evolve to be the utilities and having that capability of providing turnkey solutions and doing development is going to be putting us in a best position to serve our customers need and i think it continues to highlight the unique value composition to utility of the first solar versus alternatives that they may have so dont think of us looking to exit development well continue the development we will look to invest where its appropriate and i do think it will best position us longterm to be successful in the us market in particular operator and our next question comes from tyler frank of baird tyler charles frank  robert w baird  co inc private wealth management hi guys thanks for taking the questions can you talk about what the current market is like for buyers and utility scale projects both here in the us and internationally as well as what youre seeing for demand from utilities here in the us and then shifting gears a bit when you look at the cost for series  now youve had an opportunity to work on it a little bit more can you discuss where thats tracking to your expectations and where you expect the cost profile to get to once you start ramping capacity thank you mark r widmar  first solar inc why dont we – alex why dont you take the market assets with the us international ill try to do the demand and the cost discussion alexander r bradley  first solar inc sure id say were seeing very strong demand as i mentioned before a little bit there seems to be dearth of quality large assets in the us in  and even going into  and despite some of the uncertainty in the market around potential tax reform theres still is a strong appetite from tax equity capital providers from debt providers and from cash equity owners we are seeing broader sways of buyers coming into the market so historically we saw tax equity and some infrastructure players only along the side the strategics the yield cos came and went id say were seeing more interest from infrastructure money and longterm pension money so the market remains very resilient in the us in the short and mediumterm internationally its very dependent on the regions that were in we have a development business in japan i would say that thats one of the more liquid markets from a debt perspective for solar business so were very happy with the debt capital that weve been raising for our assets there and we have yet to sell largescale assets in japan but we are very confident based on the discussions weve been having with buyers that there is going to be significant appetite for longterm contracted assets in japan and we expect to realize good margins out of those assets now the markets in the world its very dependent but id say generally were seeing pretty strong demand in every market where were continuing to develop assets both on the debt equity side where relevant on the debt side and on the cash equity side mark r widmar  first solar inc i think on the demand question around i think it was specific to more us utilities if i look at us utilities and again whats really happening is solar in particular is kind of the demand associated with it is essentially solely on the merits of the economics i mean demand is – the of cost of solar has come down so much and its competitive and everyone is looking at longterm integrated resource plans and have a movement more towards integration of solar and a lot of utilities theres someone at the forefront of their journey around that i will say though that i did make my comment about utilities trying to rate base i do think there is an undertone a lot of utilities are trying to find a profile and an opportunity to rate base the solar assets and i think thats really – ultimately would prefer to do but im not seeing other than utilities in california theyre dealing with a number of issues whether its the emergence of community choice aggregators and load being pulled away from them or whether its with the distributed resources such as residential rooftop theyre clearly in a different mindset on how theyre thinking about a procurement note but the vast majority of the other utilities that were engaging with i would say demand is very robust at this point in time on the cost of series  the one thing ill reemphasize i think i said this on the guidance call way back in november is that the towering strength of this company is its people and we have tremendously talented people creative knowledgeable innovative and they continue to amaze me and surprise me with their capabilities and where we ultimately can go with this technology were very happy with where we are in the timeline and the progression of getting this product commercialized into the market the reality though is were not going to stop when we get the product initially into the market were going to continue to drive the efficiency up the road map is not done theres still room to grow and theres still room to drive cost down and we know that at the end of the day the technology that will win this marketplace is the highest performing lowestcost and we believe we have a platform that can enable that it creates differentiation and separation relative to our competitors and the journey of where we are at this point in time i would say were in a very good position long ways to go but im not going to commit specifically to the cost profile and the view of where we thought we were going to be i would just say that im very encouraged with the work the team has done and the opportunities that is in front of us operator and our next question comes from colin rusch of oppenheimer colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc thanks so much guys so i have two model questions so if i look back at the numbers that youre reporting for  both topline and bottom line it looks like about  million of delta and about  of eps is the change and thats roughly in line with the adjustments in  is that really what were seeing here in the  guidance alexander r bradley  first solar inc no so if you go back – and youll have to wait till you see the q but what youre going to see with the change in the accounting standards is youre going to see significant fluctuation quarterly but on a cumulative basis the impact is very limited so the  opening with same earnings impact with a total of about  million so the delta that youre seeing on the accounting standard change have no impact to change were giving on the guidance side at the moment mark r widmar  first solar inc yeah so dont think about this as somehow theres a shift from the result of the adoption the accounting standard had an adverse impact on q and then somehow benefited  thats not the effect the point that alex mentioned the retained earnings impact was small and that was a cumulative impact we had to go back a number of years to effectively restate under the new accounting standard what the implications would have been and that was a nominal impact to retained earnings whats flowing through in the guidance for  is weve indicated is just operational results better cost per watt and better visibility around valuation for project sales operator and our next question comes from pavel molchanov of raymond james pavel s molchanov  raymond james  associates inc thanks for taking the question guys in your remarks you had some language about improvement in the landscape industry landscape for project economics and i guess i would ask when you say its getting better whats the baseline what are you comparing that to  a year ago alexander r bradley  first solar inc id say were comparing that to how we saw the market at the time we gave our guidance so when we came out with our original guidance in november last year and then updated in february were seeing a significant change in how we are perceiving the value of our assets since that time based on feedback weve been getting from the market both from the sale of the switch asset and then also from unsolicited process weve had relative to some other projects that we have so were basing it on feedback from the market as opposed to when we originally gave guidance when we had perhaps less clarity specific to those discrete assets operator and we will take our final question from edwin mok of needham  company arthur su  needham  company llc hi everyone this is actually arthur on for edwin thanks for taking our questions the first one is just on the series  transition beyond the initial line in ohio and the eight lines in malaysia can you give us the initial look at the milestones you have in place for the other production facilities and then secondly can you provide an update on any progress in penetrating international markets i think in the past youve highlighted australia and india yeah thank you mark r widmar  first solar inc so the transition – in the last earnings call and unfortunately i dont have the slide so when we talked about there we had a timeline that actually showed the major milestones in the progression of where we are what i would say right now is that we now have approval and actually we are in the process now of again – perrysburg has been completely tore down were starting to receive some of the tools the two plants in malaysia have actually been – equipments been removed now in the process of getting ready to receive tools and then weve actually started momentum now moving into vietnam and so we refer to as the first phase is terra  and then terra   which is the plant  and  in malaysia and then terra   being in vietnam and all of thats in progress right now so weve got three different work streams of activities that were ongoing which when you aggregate up that capacity across those three that will get us to about  gigawatts of production and then the next phase will be referred to as terra   which will give us another  gigawatts or so of production and thats really should be largely running up at least on a runrate basis as we get through the end of  beginning of  well be on that kind of run rate across that platform of those two – of those terra    and ultimately terra   so we feel good about it and theres a timeline we had in the last earnings call maybe to give you a little bit more color from the standpoint the international markets continue to be very robust and theres continuing engagement with us the one thing i will say though is that we are capacity constrained right now around series  and as it relates to some of that demand profile that were seeing in the international markets theyre looking for module shipments that would happen later this year into the first half of  and so as it relates to having limited module supply that constraints a little bit to engage in some of those discussions and then the first half of the – the second half of  the production that will produce series  largely is going to be allocated to our own development assets so were really looking at a timeline of getting out into  before we really have a lot of supply that we can engage the market with and then particularly address some of the international market opportunities but what ill say is that we are almost always kind of a supplier of choice and when theres an opportunity where ever it is whether its domestic or international were generally giving an opportunity to address those market potentials especially in markets where we have a good – an advantage or a temperature co efficiency factor respond hot humid climates particular theres clearly a poll for our
