ally financial in april  for  million today in  tradeking continues to operate as a standalone brand underneath the ally umbrella the broker remains focused on providing clients discounted trades without sacrificing a smooth client experience while numerous synergies are planned for tradeking in the future – for example i can’t wait to have my ally highyield savings account linked with my

does not currently offer any commissionfree etfs one thing i did not like on the tradeking website was the process of placing a trade instead of an allinone trade ticket tradeking has more than a dozen separate trade ticket pages which makes it inconvenient fortunately for clients though the trade ticket provided on the new tradeking live platform is far superior and i highly recommend using it rather than the website customer service as in previous years of the three methods we tested for our  review – phone email and live chat – phone support was once again tradeking’s weakest means of communication although response times were good with  of our calls being connected in less than a minute the reps did not make a strong impression in spite of the fact that they were generally knowledgeable and friendly more specifically on only two of our ten tests did our private testers leave a “great” overall net promoter score for a call tradeking finished th out of  brokers for phone support phone support aside email and live chat were much more impressive live chat finished fourth overall in the industry and email support finished fifth phone support aside email and live chat were much more impressive live chat finished fourth overall in the industry and email support finished fifth in the end tradeking once again ended up with a fourstar rating for customer service good but not “great” easeofuse ease of use is a category encompassing quite a large area from logging in to navigating the website placing a trade managing account preferences and conducting research it’s about the full experience tradeking has had several challenges in the past from the login process during which we are still asked to answer security questions even though we have checked to have it remember our information to navigating the site’s triple navigation maze it’s a rough journey still currently housed in a separate area tradeking live couldn’t come soon enough fortunately tradeking is correcting most of these pain points with its new tradeking live  responsive website which launched in  still currently housed in a separate area tradeking live couldn’t come soon enough everything about the client experience has improved streaming quotes are everywhere and trades can be placed from any page using the right sidebar trade ticket a fully customizable dashboard takes advantage of tiles similar to microsoft products even monitoring orders pulling quotes and assessing portfolio performance have been creatively refreshed platforms  tools tradeking live was initially a little weak in the charting and options areas however thanks to updates made in  both have been enhanced the charts are smooth easy to modify and now include  drawing tools as well as  different technical indicators both counts are a monster improvement over the two and three respectively we counted the previous year with options in tradeking live profit  loss pl charts were completely reworked in  and no longer suffer from the java security errors that once haunted us during testing instead pl charts are now clean customizable and flow extremely well with the rest of the research process deep analysis now also includes the flexibility to be able to assess theoretical positions with live positions while i was really excited about tradeking live’s launch in  now early in  the platform still has multiple areas that require improvement while i was really excited about tradeking live’s launch in  now early in  the platform still has multiple areas that require improvement first ironing out the viewing experience should be a priority for tradeking – the desktop is clean but the smartphone view still needs some ui tweaks second the main website’s research functionality has not yet made its debut third adding some more functionality to round out core client activities then pushing live into the limelight as the default experience for every client should undoubtedly be tradeking’s  goal for  one final note on tradeking’s platforms and tools thanks to the acquisition of mb trading in  customers will eventually gain access to mb trading’s active trader desktop platform for a deeper look at the platform read our mb trading review and scroll down to the platforms  tools section research compared to other brokers with similar discounted pricing tradeking is offering is the best tradeking does a very good job of bringing visuals and interactive analysis into the research experience whether analyzing earnings or insider transactions the graphs have overlays that identify key points which makes the experience far more insightful than staring at straight data that said we could do without the random banner advertisements promoting tradeking’s products we also appreciate the subtle details such as including a trends column when reading a company’s income statement balance sheet or cash flows tradeking also includes a peer comparison chart for equities research another nice touch not found with other discount brokers customers can even download historical pricing spreadsheets for any security lastly tradeking provides only one thirdparty research report from standard  poors with the offering of discounted trades multiple thirdparty reports cannot be provided because the cost is simply too high given that nearly all of tradeking’s close discount competitors provide no reports at all this is fine with me other notes for mobile trading tradeking offers customers ios and android smartphone apps but nothing more the apps are decent and include the core functionality needed to effectively monitor one’s portfolio and trade on the go but they don’t stand out otherwise with tradeking live being designed for mobile devices as well as desktop computers we imagine tradeking is going to eventually either sunset its mobile apps in favor of tradeking live or decide to support the app and invest more resources in updates see best brokers for mobile trading tradekings community the trader network allows clients to share their real trades write notes on why they made them and interact with the rest of the community via blogs forums and groups while the area was active in the late s over the years clients have found other interests twitter stocktwits and other financial social networks now dominate the social landscape while always hard to let go tradeking is probably best off to sunset the trader network in favor of a more modernday approach to social trading that or it needs to make a serious investment to respark client interest final thoughts over the past three years tradeking has hurt itself by spreading its development and leadership resources too thinly acquisitions of competitors and expanding into new business lines such as professional advice see our tradeking advisors review detracted from developing tradeking live and fixing website usability issues such as navigation and client login not only that tradeking itself was acquired by ally financial in  which as one could expect took up resources these growing pains caused delays but were necessary steps in the longterm effort to evolve and provide a fantastic experience with a clear direction alongside ally financial’s brand and resources behind it i am optimistic  will be the best year yet for tradeking clients methodology for our  stock
