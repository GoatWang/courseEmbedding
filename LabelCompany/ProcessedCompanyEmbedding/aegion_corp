incorporated on august   is engaged in providing infrastructure protection and maintenance the company operates through three segments infrastructure solutions corrosion protection and energy services the company offers service solutions including rehabilitation of water and wastewater pipelines with insituform curedinplace pipe cipp products fusible polyvinyl chloride products for rehabilitation fiber reinforced polymer systems for rehabilitation and strengthening cathodic protection for corrosion engineering control and infrastructure rehabilitation pipe coatings for corrosion control and prevention high density polyethylene hdpe pipe lining for corrosion control abrasion protection and pipeline rehabilitation and construction and maintenance of oil and gas facilitiesinfrastructure solutionsthe companys insituform cipp process for the rehabilitation of sewers pipelines and other conduits utilizes a custommanufactured tube or liner made of synthetic fiber after the tube is saturated impregnated with a thermosetting resin mixture it is installed in the host pipe by various processes and the resin is then cured by heat using hot water or steam forming a rigid pipe within a pipe its iplus infusion process is a trenchless method used for the rehabilitation of smalldiameter sewer pipelines whereby a felt liner is continuously impregnated with liquid thermosetting resin through a process after which the liner is pulled into the host pipe inflated with air and cured with steam its iplus composite process is a trenchless method used for the rehabilitation of largediameter sewer pipelines where the felt liner is reinforced with carbon or glass fiber impregnated with liquid thermosetting resin inverted into place and cured with hot water or steam its insitumain system is a curedinplace pipe solution for pressure pipes the insitumain system is for water mains and force mains over inches in diameter its insituguard insituflex and insitufold processes are methods of rehabilitating transmission and distribution water mains using hdpe liners inserted into an existing pipeline by the companys installation processes the liners are continuous and installed tightly against the inner wall of the host pipe thereby isolating the flow stream from the host pipe wall and eliminating internal corrosionthe factoryfolded c shape liner is winched into the host pipe from a reel and reverted with air and steam its insituform rpp process is a trenchless technology used for the rehabilitation of sewer force mains and industrial pressure pipelines the felt tube is reinforced with glass and impregnated with liquid thermosetting resin after which it is inverted with water and cured with hot water to form a structural jointless pipe within the host pipe its insituform ppl process is a trenchless technology that is used for the rehabilitation of drinking water and industrial pressure pipelines a glassreinforced liner is impregnated with an epoxy or vinyl ester resin inverted with water and cured with hot water to form a jointless pipe lining within the host pipe its sealing method process is a method for providing reconnection to a ferrule of a service line from within the bore of a lined host pipe its uvglass lining system is a cured in place pipe solution for small to mediumdiameter pipes utilizing a glass fiber tube that is impregnated with a resin sensitive to ultraviolet light or steam curing its fusible pvc technology contains polyvinyl chloride pvc formulation that when combined with its patented fusion process results in a monolithic fullyrestrained gasketfree leakfree piping system fusible pvc pipe products include fusible c fusible c and fpvc its serviceguard composite pipe product combines the performance benefits of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride cpvc with the strength and durability of an aluminum core to offer the ultimate water service line pipethe companys fibrwrap and tyfo processes are methods applying high strength fiber fabric to strengthen structures and the connections between structural components thereby strengthening repairing and restoring masonry concrete steel and wooden structures the fibrwrap and tyfo products are construction and engineering materials comprising hybrid fiberepoxy composites used for retrofitting or repairing structures its fibrbundle process relates to devices systems and methods for reinforcing pipes and other structures the fibrbundle products are nonmetal building materials namely tows of carbon fibers for strengthening bridges buildings and other structures the companys fibrpipewrap product and process relates to the construction and civil engineering material in the nature of hybrid fiberepoxy composites used for retrofitting or repairing structuresthe companys sewer pipeline rehabilitation activities are conducted principally through installation and other construction operations performed directly by its subsidiaries it utilizes multifunctional robotic devices developed by a french subsidiary in connection with the inspection and repair of pipelines it also maintains a manufacturing facility in wellingborough the united kingdom to support its international operations and through which it sells liners to third parties the companys infrastructure rehabilitation operations also utilize fiberreinforced polymer frp to rehabilitate and strengthen pipelines buildings bridges tunnels industrial developments and waterfront structures throughout the united states and canada through fibrwrap construction services and in its asian markets through its subsidiaries and through its joint ventures in borneo korea and indonesia through fyfe co fyfe it designs and manufactures the frp

logistics its acs business specializes in the application of internal corrosion coatings services provision of external field joint anticorrosion coating services and the supply of equipment all for pipeline construction projects onshore and offshore in locations around the worldthe companys tite liner process is a method of lining new and existing pipe with a corrosion and abrasion resistant highdensity polyethylene pipe its safetyliner product is a grooved hdpe liner that is installed in an industrial pipeline using the tite liner process the safetyliner liner is used in natural gas or carbon dioxide co pipelines to allow release of gas that permeates the hdpe liner the safetyliner liner also has been used in pipelines as a leak detection system and for dual containment in mine water pipelines its innergard product is an internal fusion bonded epoxy fbe coating that provides corrosion protection for water injection lines its enventure product is an internal lubricity coating for solid expandable downhole tubulars its coatcheck product includes instruments for measuring pipe joint and surface treatment quality parameters its corrflex system is a linear anode system installed parallel to pipeline its corrspray product provides a solution for preventing corrosion of steel reinforcements in concrete structures its green rectifier system is an ecologically friendly method of cathodic protection using solar panels and a wind generator to power the cathodic protection process its grid system has set the global standard for preventing releases from external corrosion of at grade storage tanks containing oil and petroleum products thereby ensuring safe operations and protection of the environment its ac interference mitigation acim solution protects
