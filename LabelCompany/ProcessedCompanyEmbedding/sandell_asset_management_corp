since last year to inject a newlyinvigorated culture of accountability and excellence at the company hopefully our november  letter to the board was helpful in outlining our concerns regarding the status of the very real expression of interest in bef foods that had been previously conveyed by a motivated and highlysophisticated industry participant post holdings inc “post” to recap we have been told by knowledgeable sources that post had expressed an interest in pursuing a transaction with bob evans involving its packaged foods business bef foods within the last year furthermore we understand that post has a continuing strong interest in pursuing a transaction with bob evans involving bef foods and has the ability to creatively structure a transaction in a manner that could reduce or eliminate the tax consequences to bob evans note that post is a publiclytraded company with a market value in excess of  billion that could use both cash and stock as acquisition currency as well as one or more underlying business units such as michael foods that could serve to facilitate the formation of a joint venture or other such arrangement with bef foods based on the company’s recent fiscal  second quarter results along with various analyst estimates it appears that bef foods may generate somewhere in the vicinity of  million in ebitda this year and we note that this figure is after the allocation of what we believe may be about  million of corporate overhead thus bef foods may generate approximately  million in ebitda before the allocation of corporate overhead a figure much more relevant to a strategic industry participant based on that amount we believe that the value that a strategic buyer could ascribe to bef foods may greatly exceed the entire market value of bob evans which at an approximate stock price of  per share is about  million indeed hormel is trading at close to x ebitda and there have been two transactions in the last year and a half involving companies comparable to bef foods namely hillshire brands and applegate farms that were effected at multiples estimated at x and x ebitda respectively it is not unrealistic to assume that bef foods could command a value in excess of  million currently an approximate  stock price implies an enterprise value to bob evans of about  billion assuming an  million market value and  million of net debt assuming a value for bef foods of  million leads to the truly shocking conclusion that investors are ascribing a value to the bob evans restaurant business of about  million this is less than half of the approximate  million in value that could be ascribed solely to the company’s owned restaurant real estate bob evans is being punished by maintaining combined ownership of both its restaurant and bef foods business we had a robust discussion with the members of the finance committee last week where we noted our strong desire to see the company engage a new financial advisor so that it could assess the various alternatives that bob evans could pursue to enhance shareholder value and particularly taxefficient alternatives relating to the separation of bef foods andor bob evans restaurants we were therefore understandably disappointed that the company made no reference to the retention of a new financial advisor in either its recent earnings release or associated conference call while we do not know if the entire board of directors was fully informed of our views expressed to the finance committee to be certain we are sending this correspondence to the entire board while there is a compelling industrial logic to separating bef foods the company must also be mindful of tax issues and we fully understand the complexity that may be involved in planning such a business separation this is all the more reason to now retain an independent nationallyrecognized investment banking firm to explore the numerous options available to bob evans in order that it may develop a fullyinformed plan furthermore the timing to effect a separation of bef foods is ideal particularly considering that the company recently announced that it has named saed mohseni as ceo and president effective as of january   while mr mohseni does not appear to have an extensive food products background he has an enormous wealth of restaurant experience which will be of great value as he seeks to enhance the bob evans restaurant business his efforts to reposition the bob evans restaurant business for greatness should not be distracted by the continued presence of bef foods it continues to be our strong contention that the intrinsic value of bob evans is far greater than the value implied by its current stock price and given the dramatic uptick in valuations in the packaged foods space we believe that the ultimate separation of bef foods andor bob evans restaurants would serve to narrow what we believe is this draconian discount to intrinsic value we therefore believe that now is the time for the entire board of directors to take prompt action to address this issue as always we would be pleased to discuss these and other matters with you in greater detail at your convenience

governance and performance sees value of over  per share in sale of company transition to platform company may deliver over  per share of value sandell prepared to nominate slate of director candidates for  annual meeting september    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wiresandell asset management corp and its affiliates “sandell” the beneficial owner of approximately  million shares or  of viavi solutions inc “viavi” or the “company” and formerly jds uniphase corporation nasdaqviav today sent a letter to the company’s board of directors the “board” in the letter sandell outlines a number of actions it believes the company must undertake in order to enhance value and reverse the poor governance and performance that has plagued its shareholders these actions include refreshing and materially enhancing the quality of viavi’s board of directors conducting a thorough review of strategic alternatives retaining an independent financial advisor and operational consulting firm and identifying a new management team with the experience necessary to maximize the value of the company’s deferred tax assets which include its  billion to  billion of federal net operating losses nols sandell believes that such a strategic review should include the exploration of alternatives for the nse and osp business as well as viavi as a whole sandell believes that shareholders could receive over  per share in value if viavi was sold in its entirely while a value in excess of  per share could be realized if the company were to transition itself into a taxadvantaged “platform company” examples of publiclytraded “platform companies” or acquisition vehicles include jarden corporation nysejah platform specialty products corporation nysepah and nomad foods limited lsenhl and the company should seek to identify a ceo with the background needed to reposition viavi as such a company sandell has identified a number of outstanding potential board members and is prepared to nominate a competing slate of director candidates for the company’s  annual meeting  though it would be sandell’s preference to reach an amicable resolution that would avoid the need for a contentious proxy battle sandell had engaged in good faith dialogue with viavi in the very recent past but was not able to enter into a settlement agreement due to certain conditions that the company sought to impose sandell believes that the nomination window to submit candidates for the board of directors of viavi opens on september  the text of the letter is as follows september   the board of directorsviavi solutions inc north mccarthy boulevardmilpitas ca  attention richard e belluzzo chairman and interim ceoco kevin siebert secretary dear rick as you know sandell asset management corp “sandell” is a significant shareholder of viavi solutions inc “viavi” or the “company” and formerly jds uniphase corporation with current beneficial ownership of approximately  million shares or  of the company while we appreciate the previous dialogue that my colleague richard mansouri and i have had with you and other company representatives over the last few months as well as the diligent good faith efforts that we had put into recent settlement discussions our firm could not in good conscience enter into a settlement agreement with viavi unless such agreement provided for meaningful comprehensive change at the company this was particularly important given the company’s history of what we believe to be troubling governance practices poor operating results and truly abhorrent stock price performance furthermore certain conditions that you sought to impose upon us were far from standard and in fact highly offensive along with the recent release of viavi’s fiscal fourth quarter and year end  results we learned that ceo thomas waechter is leaving the company while we harbor no personal animosity toward mr waechter we view this development as a unique opportunity for the company to finally take the steps necessary to deliver value to its longsuffering shareholders it is in fact noteworthy that in our settlement discussions viavi had insisted that mr waechter maintain his role of ceo we fear that the exit of mr waechter as well as the company’s apparent newlyfound desire to add two new directors reflects an insufficient attempt at meaningful change from our settlement discussions you should be aware that we have identified a number of truly outstanding candidates for the board of directors furthermore we have made it very clear that the ultimate composition of the board is but one component of what must be a sweeping improvement in the overall governance and management of the company which would include a thorough reevaluation of the company’s strategic alternatives the retention of a new financial advisor and operational consulting firm and the identification of a new management team capable of extracting value from the company’s deferred tax assets relating to its multibillion dollar balance of federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards nols it is this last point that merits further discussion as we are astonished by the company’s apparent failure to understand the potential value of such tax assets notwithstanding very recent comments from cfo rex jackson that viavi possesses between  billion to  billion of federal nols alone from a “big picture” perspective the value ascribed to nols is related to the amount and timing of pretax income that such nols can shield from tax to put it another way the utilization and thus value of a company’s nols increases as the amount of pretax income generated by such company increases moreover the faster this income is generated the more quickly that these nols can be utilized and hence the higher the present value afforded to them until we made our thoughts regarding viavi publicly known in october of  there had been next to no mention of the potential value of the company’s nols even now as recently as the company’s august  fiscal fourth quarter conference call the vague comments made by viavi suggest that the board has little idea how to maximize the value of these tax assets as chairman of the board and interim ceo you may recall that your exact comments on the conference call were “i think we have more work to do on nols clearly it’s a big number” which does not exactly suggest a robust grasp of the topic nor an urgency to address it in our informed opinion the method by which viavi could generate maximum value from its vast balance of nols is to transition itself into what is known as a “platform company” there are at least three publiclytraded platform companies or acquisition vehicles that have generated a wide following in the investment community namely jarden platform specialty products and nomad foods due in large part to the acumen demonstrated by their management teams and boards of directors and we should note that none of these companies possessed any meaningful tax assets to speak of we contrast this with viavi whose operational history in our opinion has been nothing short of disastrous its muchhyped attempt to transition to a softwarecentric business through the expensive and destructive buildout of its se segment has cost hundreds of millions of dollars and has saddled the company with significant and recurring operating losses with the departure of thomas waechter the company now has the ability to conduct a farreaching search in order to identify an executive with the background needed to reposition viavi as a taxadvantaged platform company in the interim viavi must retain an operational consulting firm such as alvarez  marsal in order to identify and eliminate the many excess costs that we believe are plaguing the company along with the need to identify a new ceo is the desperate need for the company to conduct a dispassionate review of strategic alternatives the board appears to still cling to the belief that viavi should continue to be in the test and measurement business notwithstanding the consolidation taking place in this space and what we believe to be the lack of operational competence demonstrated by the company at minimum viavi should explore the sale of the nse segment to any of a number of other larger companies such as keysight technologies inc keys who we believe would be able to wring substantial savings out of such a business in a similar manner a strategic review of the company’s highlyprofitable osp segment should be undertaken as we do not believe that viavi’s stock price reflects the potential value that a knowledgeable third party would ascribe to such a business moreover the contribution of the osp business to viavi is being obscured by the poor performance of the nse business and the inordinately high corporate overhead present at the company to conduct such a review we believe the company must hire a new and truly independent financial advisor untainted by previous dealings with the company in order to conduct a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for both the osp and the nse business as well as options for viavi as a whole despite all the concern for “value” that various company representatives have professed we fear that the board has little understanding of what “value” means to the institutional community quite simply the “value” of a publiclytraded company is measured by such company’s stock price and by this metric we find that the board has overseen a truly shocking erosion of value by our approximate calculations the value of viavi may easily be between  and  higher than its existing share price as is illustrated below                                         base case             upside case      in millions multiple section  nols multiple platform value             nse nese  mm fy revenue     osp  mm fy operating income     add cash and investments

                                       in the “section ” case the annual use of nols is limited to the longterm taxexempt rate multiplied by the exnol value of viavi in the “platform” case viavi is assumed to make acquisitions for total consideration equal to the exnol value of viavi plus an equivalent amount of leverage at an acquisition price of x pretax income financed  cash and debt with annual nol use equal to pretax income less  interest expense on incremental debt both cases discount  years of annual tax savings at an assumed  tax rate and a  discount rate we highlight the fact that we approximate the company’s tax assets in two ways the first being the most draconian method which assumes that viavi is sold in its entirety to another acquirer in which case the company’s nols would be subject to a section  limitation even in this draconian scenario we believe that shareholders could realize a value of  which is  higher than its current price the other method assumes that the company monetizes its underlying business segments and transitions to a taxadvantaged platform company in which viavi utilizes these proceeds plus the company’s existing cash and investments along with incremental leverage to pursue an acquisition or series of acquisitions of profitable businesses we believe this alternative could yield a value of  which is  higher than the current price in order to take these critical and necessary steps to deliver enhanced value to the shareholders of viavi the company must have a board consisting of truly objective individuals with a deep knowledge of complex financial matters as well as a fulsome understanding of the public markets furthermore we have no confidence whatsoever that the company’s purported search for two new directors will result in the addition of members who will be able to offset the collective inertia that we believe pervades the existing board as you are aware the nomination window to submit candidates for the board of directors of viavi opens on september  and we are prepared to submit a competing slate of director candidates for the  annual meeting that said it remains our preference to reach an amicable resolution that would avoid the need to embark upon a costly distracting and no doubt highlycontentious proxy battle if you are willing to enter into good faith discussions with a view towards
