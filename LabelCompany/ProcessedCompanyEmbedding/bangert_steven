cape girardeau mo counsel who presented argument on behalf of the appellee was john e galvin of st louis mo donald j ohl of edwardsville il appeared on the brief before bye heaney and colloton circuit judges bye circuit judge  steven menz and his wife jennifer menz sued new holland north america and others for their injuries arising out of a tractor rollover accident the district court denied their motion to remand the case to state court and then dismissed the action as a sanction for spoliation of evidence the menzes appeal both orders we affirm in part reverse in part and remand for further proceedings   on october   steven menz was moving dirt with his ford  tractor at the bottom of a levy next to his farm near jackson missouri the tractor was equipped with a frontend loader manufactured by westendorf manufacturing the loader was approximately threequarters full of dirt when the tractors front tire skidded into a hole and the tractor rolled over menzs left arm remained pinned between the ground and the tractor seat most of the day menz suffered several injuries including the amputation of his left arm  after the accident menz repaired the tractor by replacing the back fenders seat steering wheel muffler and hood approximately two months after the accident menz bought a different tractor equipped with a footactivated throttle intending to buy a different loader he could operate after his amputation menz sold the westendorf loader in the summer and fall of  menz completed the farm work he had been performing at the time of the accident changing the slope of the levy  in november  the menzes filed suit in st louis circuit court against new holland north america ford motor company bangert tractor sales and westendorf manufacturing the menzes sued bangert a missouri company they used to service and repair the tractor for negligent failure to warn of the dangers associated with tractor tipovers and for failing to offer to retrofit the tractor with a roll over protection system rops  in december  ford and new holland removed the case to federal court alleging bangert the one nondiverse defendant was fraudulently joined and should be disregarded for purposes of establishing diversity jurisdiction the district court denied a motion to remand brought by the menzes concluding they had failed to state cognizable claims against bangert  in january  ford filed a motion for sanctions seeking to have the case dismissed because the menzes spoliated evidence by making the postaccident repairs to the tractor selling the westendorf loader and completing the levy work which allegedly altered the scene of the accident without determining whether the menzes acted in bad faith the district court granted the motion concluding the spoliation prejudiced the defendants and rendered a full defense impossible  the menzes filed a timely appeal on appeal they contend the district court erred in concluding bangert was fraudulently joined for the purpose of destroying diversity jurisdiction they also contend the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the case as a sanction for spoliation of evidence ii a fraudulent joinder  we review the district courts denial of the remand motion de novo watson v philip morris cos inc  fd   th cir see also mayes v rapoport  fd   th cir we review de novo questions of subject matter jurisdiction including those relating to the propriety of removal and fraudulent joinder  the common thread underlying the question whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction is reason thus a proper review should give paramount consideration to the reasonableness of the basis underlying the state claim filla v norfolk s ry  fd   th cir joinder is fraudulent when there exists no reasonable basis in fact and law supporting a claim against the resident defendants id quoting wiles v capitol indem corp  fd   th cir   bangerts involvement in this case stems from its occasional repair and service of the tractor involved in the accident as a result of that involvement the menzes claim bangert had a duty to warn of the dangers associated with rollovers and a duty to offer to retrofit the tractor with a rops we address the reasonableness of each of these claims in turn  duty to warn of rollovers  with respect to the dutytowarn claim missouri law provides suppliers of products can be liable for failing to warn of a products allegedly dangerous characteristics eg hill v gen motors  swd   moctapp noting missouris adoption of section  of the restatement second of torts relying upon comment c to section  of the restatement second of torts the menzes argue bangert was a supplier of the tractor in question comment c provides a supplier includes one who undertakes the repair of a chattel and who delivers it back with knowledge that it is defective because of the work which he is employed to do upon it restatement second of torts §  cmt c   by its own terms comment c only applies to a negligent repairer who knows a product is defective because of the specific repair work he is asked to perform in this case there is no evidence bangert was ever asked to repair or inspect the tractors stability instead the menzes seek to extend a repairers duty to include a duty to warn of general dangers in the product unrelated to the specific repair work performed the menzes contend there is no fraudulent joinder so long as they allege a colorable claim that is if the state law might impose liability on the resident defendant under the facts alleged filla  fd at  although there are no missouri cases on point the menzes contend missouri courts may expand the duty of a repairer to include the duty to warn of general dangers associated with a product unrelated to the specific repair work performed  the nonmissouri cases the menzes cite in support of their contention all involve a repairers failure to warn of a defect related to the specific repair work performed see delbrel v doenges bros ford inc  pd   okla involving an allegation negligent repairs caused a vehicle to die in the roadway mozie v sears roebuck  co  ad   dc involving an injury allegedly caused by brake failure against a repairer who inspected the brakes schichtl v slack  ark   swd    involving the failure to warn of the danger of fire associated with overheating in a newlyinstalled engine and transmission hunt v ford motor co  so d   lactapp involving injuries caused by a defective steering mechanism where the difficulties with the steering were repeatedly called to the repairers attention we found no jurisdiction which has expanded a repairers duty to include the duty to warn of general dangers associated with a product unrelated to the specific repair work performed as a consequence we conclude it is unreasonable to believe missouri would impose such a duty upon a repair service provider   duty to offer to retrofit the tractor with a rops  next the menzes contend bangert had a duty to offer to retrofit the ford tractor with a rops we disagree under missouri law even a manufacturer has no duty to offer to retrofit a tractor with a rops when such was not required at the time of manufacture morrison v kubota tractor corp  swd   moctapp  as a consequence it is unreasonable to contend missouri courts would impose such a duty upon a mere repair service provider  because neither claim the menzes brought against bangert was colorable under missouri law the district court did not err in denying the motion to remand this case to state court b spoliation of evidence  we review the district courts imposition of sanctions for an abuse of discretion stevenson v union pac rr co  fd   th cir a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence plaintiffs baycol steering comm v bayer corp  fd   th cir quoting cooter  gell v hartmarx corp  us    s ct   l ed d    the menzes contend the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the case because  there was no determination steve menz acted in bad faith in causing or allowing the destruction of evidence  steve menz lacked knowledge of the evidences possible significance to any potential or pending litigation and therefore had no duty to preserve the evidence  the sanction of dismissal deprived the menzes of a property right without due process of law  the menzes gained no evidentiary advantage and therefore a lesser sanction if any should have been imposed and  the defendants were not prejudiced since their need for testing to prepare a defense could have been met through the use of exemplar products  we first address the menzes contention supported with cites to both federal and missouri law the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the case as a sanction for spoliation of evidence without first determining whether steve menz acted in bad faith we need not decide whether federal or state law governs in this diversity action because the result is the same under both—to warrant dismissal as a sanction for spoliation of evidence there must be a finding of intentional destruction indicating a desire to suppress the truth stevenson  fd at  see also morris v union pac rr  fd   th cir noting under stevenson a finding of intent is required to impose the sanction of an adverse inference instruction brown v hamid  swd   mo the evidentiary spoliation doctrine applies when there is intentional destruction of evidence indicating fraud and a desire to suppress the truth  the appellees contend stevenson and morris are distinguishable because they dealt with the sanction of an adverse inference instruction against a defendant rather than the sanction of dismissal against a plaintiff we disagree although stevenson and morris involved defendants who spoliated evidence the reasoning in those cases applies equally to plaintiffs a finding of bad faith is necessary before giving an adverse inference instruction at trial against a plaintiff for the destruction of evidence it would therefore be unreasonable to excuse a finding of bad faith when imposing a more severe sanction the outright dismissal of a plaintiffs case  the appellees argue dismissal is nevertheless appropriate in this case because of the extent to which they have been prejudiced by the destruction of the evidence they point out the very product at issue the tractor was substantially altered as was the scene of the accident we decline to adopt an extreme prejudice exception in this case we note after all the menzes bear the burden of proof if their case gets to trial thus in a case such as this where the menzes are pursuing a products liability action without the product the prejudice they have suffered due to the loss of the product may equal or exceed that suffered by the appellees  moreover with respect to the accident scene we note it changed substantially the very day of the accident emergency staff and fire fighters had to lift the tractor off menz with air bags and eventually a wrecker and moved dirt while going back and forth over the accident scene in stevenson we noted the limited use that destroyed track records would have served when they did not show the exact condition of the track at the time of the accident stevenson  fd at  here the levy work menz completed in the summer and fall of  has less relevance unless the levy was still in the exact condition it was at the time of the accident thus if on remand the district court determines steve menz acted in bad faith it must also determine the extent to which menzs levy work actually prejudiced the appellees ie altered a material condition of the levy as it existed at the time of the accident before a sanction for spoliation would be warranted  the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed this action without first determining whether steve menz acted in bad faith iii  we affirm the district courts order denying the motion to remand but reverse the district courts sanction order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion notes  since we are reversing on this issue it is unnecessary to address the menzes other arguments cafc homer j holland and steven bangert coexecutor of the estate of howard r ross
