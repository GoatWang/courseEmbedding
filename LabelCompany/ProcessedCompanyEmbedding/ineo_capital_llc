oil high density polyethylene polypropylene ethylene propylene butadiene mixed butenes crude benzene fuel oil olefins ethylene ethylene is produced by steam cracking feedstocks such as natural gas liquids and refining streams including ethane propane and light naphtha ethylene is a colorless gas with a slightly sweet smell it transforms from liquid into a gas at very low temperatures and is normally transported as a supercritical fluid through pipelines ethylene is used to make polyethylene ethylbenzene ethylene dichloride ethylene glycol linear alpha olefins vinyl acrylate monomer these chemicals are then used to manufacture a wide variety of products from plastic wrap to milk bottles to pvc piping ethylene is of fundamental importance to the plastics industry and is a basic building block of organic chemistry propylene propylene is a highly flammable colorless gas propylene is easier to transport than ethylene as it can be liquefied at much lower pressures and conveyed in its liquid form  our propylene is used internally as a chemical feedstock to make products such as polypropylene acrylonitrile polypropylene and acrylonitrile are used in fiber fabrics cars appliances packaging and toys  butadiene butadiene is a colorless gas at room temperature and is liquid at a few degrees below waters freezing point it is typically extracted from the c cut of an olefins cracking process but can be made through dehydrogenation of normal butane butadiene is used mainly to make synthetic rubber synthetic rubber is used to make car and truck tires and athletic shoe soles mixed butenes also called butenes or raff this c hydrocarbon stream is comprised mostly of butane components such as isobutylene and butene and contains some normal and isobutane it can be transported by pipeline railcar or barge butenes can be used directly as an alkylate feed in a refinery process or further refined and used for making consumer products raff alkylate feed is used in making gasoline refined butenes are used in the manufacture of adhesives plastics and cosmetics crude benzene crude benzene is one of the heavier products produced by a steam cracking process and is comprised mostly of the chemical component benzene a colorless highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell crude benzene is further refined to benzene where it is used in the production of other industrial chemicals such as styrene cumene crude benzene is used as a precursor in the production of pharmaceuticals plastics synthetic rubber and dyes fuel oil fuel oil is typically the heaviest cut of the steam cracking process it is a liquid at room temperature and is typically used as a fuel for the generation of heat or in an engine for the generation of power polypropylene polyethylene
