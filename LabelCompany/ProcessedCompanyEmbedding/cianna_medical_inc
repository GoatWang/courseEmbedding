system to provide instant response and realtime distance measurement jul   cianna medical inc announced that a next generation scout® radar localization system is currently undergoing clinical validation and expects to announce its commercial availability in the fourth quarter of this year this proprietary scout technology will enable unprecedented instant response and realtime distance measurement for localizing nonpalpable tumors during breast lesion excision surgery making it the most advanced localizing system in the industry with scout a highly sophisticated reflector is precisely placed at the tumor site up to  days before a lumpectomy or surgical biopsy during the procedure the surgeon scans the breast using the scout guide which transmits  million pulses per second to lock on to the reflector position the console delivers instant response feedback when the guide comes in contact with the skin providing both audible and visual indicators the next generation scout will measure and display distance in millimeters with mm accuracy allowing surgeons to optimize their breast conservation strategies scout an fdacleared nonradioactive wirefree radar breast tumor localization system is the worlds only technology that utilizes radar in human tissue previously published data establish scout as an accurate and reliable method to localize and excise breast lesions since its market introduction in  scout has been adopted at over  leading medical facilities across the united states and it has been used in more than  patient procedures to date cianna medical inc

given responsibility for numerous business disciplines to include sales sales management marketing management and new procedure development cianna medical inc announces new data demonstrating proprietary scout® radar localization system apr   cianna medical inc announced new data demonstrating the proprietary scout® radar localization system is clinically equivalent to radio seed localization rsl for surgical targeting of nonpalpable breast lesions the results were presented at the  sbiacr breast imaging symposium taking place in los angeles from april   to april   the retrospective study evaluated  patients who underwent breast conserving therapy using scout radar localization n or rsl n a technique that utilizes a radioactive seed to target tumors in all cases the average volume of resection and repeat surgery rates were equal and markers were successfully removed scout an fdacleared radar localization system is a zeroradiation wirefree solution for breast tumor localization the novel technology which is encapsulated in a device smaller than a grain of rice has received rapid adoption at medical facilities across the us and numerous technology awards offers several benefits over previous localization methods including unmatched precision to mm  or compatibility simplified scheduling optimal surgical planning and guidance improved efficiencies and higher patient and physician satisfaction at the conclusion of the study seven participating radiologists were surveyed about their experiences with both technologies all radiologists agreed that there was a minimal learning curve associated with radar localization and reported that seed localization was easier than wire localization to learn and implement the authors concluded that scout is equivalent to rsl with respect to ease of device placement and subsequent removal similar private companies by industry company name region decimal inc united states  genesystems inc united states

fda clearance for savi scout® surgical guidance system  latebreaking data from pilot study on new electromagnetic wave device for tissue targeting during breast conservation surgery at san antonio breast cancer symposium  dec    et from cianna medical inc san antonio dec   prnewswire  cianna medical inc announced today us food and drug administration clearance for the savi scout® surgical guidance system a novel technology that uses realtime audible and visual indicators to give surgeons a precise way to target tissue during lumpectomy and excisional biopsy procedures savi scout is the newest addition to the cianna medical family of products which also includes the innovative savi® breast brachytherapy applicator the savi scout surgical guidance system uses nonradioactive electromagnetic wave technology to detect a reflector that can be placed in the target tissue up to seven days prior to surgery during the procedure the surgeon then uses the savi scout handpiece which emits infrared light and electromagnetic waves to locate the reflector and plan the incision the surgeon then removes the reflector and the target tissue the savi scout surgical guidance system has a high degree of utility and we believe the system will enable us to improve care for our breast conservation surgery patients said charles e cox md professor of surgery and mccann foundation endowed professor of breast surgery university of south florida college of medicine tampa fla i found the system to be highly intuitive and expect that we will see fairly rapid uptake of the savi scout in breast centers across the country results from a pilot study evaluating successful placement localization and retrieval of the savi scout were presented as part of the late breaking scientific sessions at san antonio breast cancer symposium today the study which included  patients resulted in  surgical success using savi scout in all cases the target tissue and reflector were successfully removed there were no incidents of reflector migration or adverse events pathology reports showed clear margins in comparable numbers to radioactive seed location the goal in breastconservation surgery is to remove all detectable cancer cells of the estimated  women who have breast conservation surgery each year approximately  will require repeat surgery because cancer cells are not completely removed during the first procedure developed more than  years ago the standard preoperative technique for localizing nonpalpable breast lesions is wire localization with this procedure a wire is inserted into the breast by a radiologist to guide the surgeon to the target tissue the time between wire placement and surgery can be several hours and in addition to potentially being unpleasant for women the process presents scheduling challenges for surgeons radiologists and hospital staff radioactive seed localization rsl was developed as an alternative to wire localization despite some proven advantages the adoption of rsl has been impacted by considerable regulatory requirements and precautions for the safe handling of radioactive materials we believe that savi scout provides two major advantages first the reflector can be comfortably placed several days prior to surgery on the day of surgery by a radiologist or in the operating room by a surgeon second the savi scout handpiece can be used with retractors so as the dissection proceeds we receive immediate realtime guidance for the lumpectomy said pat whitworth md director nashville breast center nashville tenn we are finding savi scout eliminates the need to stop for intraoperative ultrasound we can now use imaging only before and after the resection i expect its going to be a welcome advance for surgeons and patients the pilot study with savi scout is ongoing at the university of south florida college of medicine and the nashville breast center cianna medical plans to bring the technology to additional medical centers over the course of  and will be supporting product uptake with professional education and ongoing reporting on data and case studies from the clinical program cianna medical adheres to a patientcentric mission and the introduction of savi scout is an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to delivering innovative products that improve patient outcomes and quality of life said jill anderson ceo cianna medical savi scout is an optimal addition to our market leading savi family and we believe it has the potential to reduce surgical delays improve patient
