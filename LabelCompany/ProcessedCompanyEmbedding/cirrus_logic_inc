about cirrus logic inc this top apple supplier is increasing its investments in its future and has several exciting growth opportunities ahead of it ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jul   at am cirrus logic nasdaqcrus is a wellknown vendor of audio chips its largest customer is apple nasdaqaapl which made up  of the companys revenue in its most recent quarter no doubt driven by its strong position in the iphone  series of smartphones and related accessories though it has been aggressively pursuing other customers in the smartphone market while trying to bring its audio products to other markets as well cirrus logic has an interesting investor presentation on its website that goes into quite a lot of detail about its business market opportunities and relevant industry trends there are three items from the presentation that i think current and prospective investors in cirrus logic should be aware of image source cirrus logic surging research and development spending cirrus logic says that its annual research and development spending has grown at a compound annual growth rate cagr of  beginning in fiscal year  back then cirrus logic spent just  million in research and development but in its most recent fiscal year  thats fiscal year   the companys research and development spending came in at  million image source cirrus logic cirrus says that it has more than  engineers in rd working to accelerate product development find and go after new market opportunities and broaden its intellectual property portfolio heres why this is encouraging first cirrus logic depends on a single customer for most of its revenue so it needs to innovate at a rapid pace to meet that customers extreme demands lest it be designed out of future apple products rendering its entire business unviable although cirrus can reduce its business risk by continuing to invest in building great products for apple and this is what the company seems to be doing its also smart for it to derisk its business by expanding both the number of major customers that it serves in its core market portable audio chips as well as the end markets it serves cirrus at least based on its statements seems to be doing just that beyond flagship smartphones cirrus logic says in its investor presentation that flagship smartphones eg iphone are fueling demand by requiring ultralow power complex signal processing to enable audio and voice use cases and increasing channel count for audio and voice inputoutput however the company also claims that its served addressable market is growing as its business grows beyond flagship cirrus says that its seeing increased penetration of new phone platforms and to capitalize on that opportunity its building technologies for lowercost devices that include optimized feature sets and cost to enable new features on new platforms the features that it says its enabling on those platforms include alwayson control and boosted speaker amplifiers with protection the smart accessories market is growing cirrus said in its presentation that it expects the total addressable for smartphones and tablets to enjoy solid growth from  to  however an area where the company seems to be expecting explosive growth is in the smart accessories market think apple airpods image source apple the company says that the total addressable market for smart accessories in units was a little over  million in  and expects that figure to approach  billion by  should the market expand as cirrus logic expects it to and should the company capture a significant share of this fastgrowing market its financial performance could benefit substantially over the next several years from the opportunity ashraf eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and

should know about cirrus logic inc this top apple supplier is increasing its investments in its future and has several exciting growth opportunities ahead of it ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jul   at am cirrus logic nasdaqcrus is a wellknown vendor of audio chips its largest customer is apple nasdaqaapl which made up  of the companys revenue in its most recent quarter no doubt driven by its strong position in the iphone  series of smartphones and related accessories though it has been aggressively pursuing other customers in the smartphone market while trying to bring its audio products to other markets as well cirrus logic has an interesting investor presentation on its website that goes into quite a lot of detail about its business market opportunities and relevant industry trends there are three items from the presentation that i think current and prospective investors in cirrus logic should be aware of image source cirrus logic surging research and development spending cirrus logic says that its annual research and development spending has grown at a compound annual growth rate cagr of  beginning in fiscal year  back then cirrus logic spent just  million in research and development but in its most recent fiscal year  thats fiscal year   the companys research and development spending came in at  million image source cirrus logic cirrus says that it has more than  engineers in rd working to accelerate product development find and go after new market opportunities and broaden its intellectual property portfolio heres why this is encouraging first cirrus logic depends on a single customer for most of its revenue so it needs to innovate at a rapid pace to meet that customers extreme demands lest it be designed out of future apple products rendering its entire business unviable although cirrus can reduce its business risk by continuing to invest in building great products for apple and this is what the company seems to be doing its also smart for it to derisk its business by expanding both the number of major customers that it serves in its core market portable audio chips as well as the end markets it serves cirrus at least based on its statements seems to be doing just that beyond flagship smartphones cirrus logic says in its investor presentation that flagship smartphones eg iphone are fueling demand by requiring ultralow power complex signal processing to enable audio and voice use cases and increasing channel count for audio and voice inputoutput however the company also claims that its served addressable market is growing as its business grows beyond flagship cirrus says that its seeing increased penetration of new phone platforms and to capitalize on that opportunity its building technologies for lowercost devices that include optimized feature sets and cost to enable new features on new platforms the features that it says its enabling on those platforms include alwayson control and boosted speaker amplifiers with protection the smart accessories market is growing cirrus said in its presentation that it expects the total addressable for smartphones and tablets to enjoy solid growth from  to  however an area where the company seems to be expecting explosive growth is in the smart accessories market think apple airpods image source apple the company says that the total addressable market for smart accessories in units was a little over  million in  and expects that figure to approach  billion by  should the market expand as cirrus logic expects it to and should the company capture a significant share of this fastgrowing market its financial performance could benefit substantially over the next several years from the opportunity ashraf eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley

mondello never got off the ground the companys final graphics chips the gdx laguna series of pciagp daccelerators were novel in that they were one of the few video cards to use rambus rdram the patented use of tiled memory used by the gdx chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today however like many other dd chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time the feature set of perspectivecorrect texture mapping bilinear filtering singlepass lighting gouraud shading and alpha blending was incomplete compared to the next generation of d chips the gdx family was limited by cpu processing at the time cpus could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block the raw processing power of the gdx was nearly  million  pixel triangles per second much faster than competitors when intel announced they were entering the d market with the i cirrus logic exited the market which at the time for cirrus logic was worth  million dollars annually intel didnt catch up in performance for many years the i was not widely accepted and did not win any major designs emulated cirrus logic graphic cards are used in emulators

speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts
