studypower distance indexuncertainty avoidance indexhttpgeerthofstedecomitalyhtmlstrategies used to minimise adverse consequences  can be argued that alliance boots utilised lewin’s ‘unfreeze change freeze’ model as part of their strategy to minimize any adverse consequences of the changes – gradual introduction of the changes – consultation of employees completed as early as possible preparing them in order to make them understand the need for change – lewin’s model – unfreeze  support offered to employees throughout the transition period for example the pensions helpline  employees kept informed as much as possible in order to make them feel involved and ultimately to maintain motivation levels and productivity without creating discontent and uncertainty the existing familyoriented culture throughout the org arguably assisted in minimise negative repercussions as employees supported each other throughout the turbulent transition period  a greater focus put on nonfinancial

interested in understanding group behaviour in moments of change he believed that groups are constantly adapting to the forces in the field“if one could identify plot and establish the potency of these forces then it would be possible not only to understand why individuals groups and behaviours behave as they do but also what forces would need to be diminished or strengthened in order to bring about change” burnes strategies used to minimise adverse consequencesafter changebefore changeboots before the mergerboots grew from a single herbalist shop in nottingham founded by john boot in it’s
