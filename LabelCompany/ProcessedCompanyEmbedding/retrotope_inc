of south florida ataxia research center and the collaborative neurosciences network in long beach ca the trial a randomized doubleblind comparator controlled twodose study of rt in  fa patients for  days met all of its primary safety tolerability and pharmacokinetic pk goals while biological activity was not a primary goal of the study a number of clinically important activity measures were tested found to be highly correlated to wellstudied disease severity scales and showed multiple unexpected robust signals of drug effect at one or more doses retrotope was also able to identify its maximum tolerated dose level mtd of rt due to one severe adverse event at higher dose gday uncontrolled diarrhea experienced by a subject with very low body mass index bmi this is a common complication of high fish oil dosing in hypercholesterolemia other adverse events were either very mild or not drug related fatty acid metabolites of rt were also detected in multiple blood compartments demonstrating the drug participated in normal fatty acid processing retrotope is announcing an extension study in which the same patients which will rerandomize into treatment and comparator arms for  months the goals of this study will be to refine dose determination under a relaxed from the original study low polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa diet establish longer term

molinari phd ceo of retrotope comments retrotope is excited to begin human trials working with fara and the friedreichs ataxia community to develop a treatment for this devastating disease  retrotope and others have discovered that free radical lipid peroxidation cascades in the mitochondrial membrane represent a common mechanism by which many degenerative diseases and especially fa trigger and amplify damage that kills cells  in fa free iron associated with the disease is a catalyst for lipid peroxidation of exactly the type we can mitigate with our drug rt a chemically stabilized form of a natural membrane fatty acid that is resistant to lipid peroxidation the rt protocol is a two center study planned for  patients with fa who are ambulatory with or without an assistive device the primary endpoints are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of two dose levels of rt when administered orally to patients with fa for  consecutive days to determine the pk profile of rt at both dose levels following a single and multiple oral administration and to determine the dose for future studies the secondary endpoints are to evaluate the effects of rt on disease state endpoints using the friedreichs ataxia rating scale neurological subscore and the timed foot walk tfw performance measurement relevant to ataxia fara has been working with retrotope for the past few years as rt has gone through preclinical development and we believe this provides an excellent example of the power of patient engagement early in the drug development process fara provided assistance in developing partnerships with academic collaborators who have tested rt in fa cellular models grant support for manufacturing attendance at regulatory meetings and engagement of the patient community in focus group discussions on diet modifications recommended for this early phase study we are excited to continue our partnership and support as we approach this new and important milestone said jennifer farmer ms cgc executive director at fara two of faras collaborative clinical research network sites the university of south florida and the university of california los angeles will be conducting the

the free radical degradation of lipids in mitochondrial and cellular membranes may actually cause disease free radicals attack and degrade the polyunsaturated fats pufas that are essential components of cellular membranes we and others have shown that the degradation products of these fats are associated with many diseases of neurodegeneration and aging and create further damage cascades that are
