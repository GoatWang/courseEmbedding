lefamulin to be the first pleuromutilin antibiotic available for systemic administration in humans we are developing both intravenous iv and oral formulations of lefamulin for the treatment of communityacquired bacterial pneumonia cabp and intend to develop lefamulin for additional indications other than pneumonialefamulin is a semisynthetic compound that inhibits the synthesis of bacterial protein which is required for bacteria to grow lefamulin acts by binding to the peptidyl transferase center or ptc on the bacterial ribosome in such a way that it interferes with the interaction of protein production at two key sites known as the “a” site and the “p” site resulting in the inhibition of bacterial proteins and the cessation of bacterial growth lefamulin’s binding occurs with high affinity high specificity and at molecular sites that are different than other antibiotic classes we believe the preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date suggest that lefamulin’s novel mechanism of action is responsible for the lack of cross resistance observed with other antibiotic classes and may result in slow development of bacterial resistance to lefamulin over time as a result of the favorable safety and tolerability profile we have observed in our clinical trials to date we believe lefamulin will present fewer potential complications relative to the use of current therapies based on our research we also believe that the availability of both intravenous iv and oral formulations of lefamulin and an option to switch to oral treatment could reduce the length of a patient’s hospital stay and the overall cost of care nabriva owns exclusive worldwide rights to lefamulin attributes that make lefamulin well suited for use as a firstline empiric
