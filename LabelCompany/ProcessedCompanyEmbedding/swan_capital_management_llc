and achievements andrew developed an early passion for finance and began his investing and following the news of the financial world when he was just  years old he pursued his early interests through

optimization strategies which guarantee income while keeping tax liabilities to a minimum he believes the ultimate goal is to protect a client’s financial assets while making their desired retirement lifestyle possible andrew finds that one of his biggest challenges is altering the client’s “accumulation paradigm” when it comes to their financial assets they must shake off the typical growth and accumulation mindset and transition to an asset preservation mode andrew states “my experience is helping clients see why a shift in paradigm is so essential andrew only works with retirees who meet very specific qualifications the relationship begins with an initial meeting between andrew and the prospective client andrew feels the initial meeting is a perfect opportunity for a prospective client to decide if swan strategies are a fit for them and for us to determine if the prospective client is a fit for us andrew confesses “there have been times i had to encourage a prospective client that he or she was not a good fit with our firm i encourage them to continue their search for a financial consultant who better aligns with their objectives”  “a fully integrated retirement plan should include an income plan a tax plan a health care plan and an estate plan andrew said sadly many people either compartmentalize each plan or don’t have a sound plan in any one of those areas”    “today with pensions being a thing of the past and retirement accounts worn down by recessions the majority of my clients’ main concerns are ‘how do we spend down our assets and use them effectively and make sure we don’t run out of money — especially with how unpredictable the markets are’ he said clients seem to be more fearful of outliving their money than the risk of dying” andrew works to
