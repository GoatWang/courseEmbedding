receiving from other sources  or even fill a critical gap in starting up your business getting friends and family involved in business financing is not uncommon   nearly one in ten americans reports a

sales pitch the basics of private financing how to present your proposal and steps to formalize the deal to learn about the different options for raising money from family and friends read nolos article  raising private money gifts loans and equity investments making it work for everyone raising money from family or friends may seem straightforward they do something nice for you and you owe money to somebody who is understanding however getting private money has even more advantages for both sides   though certainly you should tread lightly when making your personal relationships financial advantages for you the business owner raising money from family and friends has a number of advantages especially as compared to other financing alternatives private money may be available when other money is not  if youve already maxed out your personal sources of cash but dont have the collateral or revenue to attract bank or professional equity financing the advantage of private money is obvious its your best and sometimes only source of startup capital private loans may be cheaper than other sources  family and friends unlike banks credit card companies or even microlenders are typically not out to make money off the deal you could end up paying zero interest or interest at below the market rate private loans offer flexibility  loans from banks and other institutions are nearly always standardized but private lending is flexible you can both set up a customized repayment plan for example a sixmonth grace period followed by  months of interestonly payments followed by a graduated payment schedule for  months and adjust your repayment schedule if your business hits a bump private money represents validation from key supporters  the startup phase of a new business is a very stressful time and having someone you know express his or her belief in you and your idea by writing a check can mean a lot private money requires less work than other sources of equity capital  you dont have to sell yourself nearly as hard to people who already know and trust you and this can serve as a dry run for later attempts to secure professional equity financing advantages for your lender you neednt see yourself as preying on the charitable instincts of your family and friends they also benefit in several ways from investing in your business investing in you can satisfy your investors altruistic motives  those closest to you might help finance your business because they have an unselfish desire to support you and want to see you succeed investing in you can satisfy your investors selfinterest  your investor can make money from investing in you  often more than they might get from a comparable investment in a savings account or cd alternately they might enjoy the thrill of getting involved with a successful business special considerations when mixing money and relationships of course there are potential pitfalls and hassles that come with mixing money and relationships family members may feel that you owe them one or you may not like having some lenders or investors watching your every move then criticizing your new car or family vacation and not every lender will be sympathetic as you try to explain your need to reschedule or skip a payment for the most part these are issues that can and should be dealt with in advance make the arrangement as professional as possible that way your private lender or investor will treat this as business not a personal arrangement you can for example offer collateral to secure your friend or family members loan and you should agree on clear and definite terms for any loan including payment dates interest rate and penalties if any if your friends or family make equity investments you might agree to give them a right to share the proceeds from the businesss assets if its sold how to ask friends and family for financial support the biggest hurdle preventing many entrepreneurs from getting private financing is simply the fear of asking you can overcome this fear with a combination of careful preparation and choosing a time and place that makes you and your prospective lender or investor comfortable before actually asking for the loan or investment plan out how youll approach your friend or family member decide when and where to discuss the proposition  decide whether its better to bring your request up in a casual conversation or at an informal meeting in either case you should choose a setting thats suited to your relationship  for a very close relationship it might be in the potential lenders home at a time you regularly visit them whereas a restaurant or café is a good location for meeting someone with whom youre not especially close plan what to bring  think about what you can bring along to illustrate your plans such as a brochure sample product or company logo but remember that this is an informal situation where detailed plans and promissory notes would be out of place to actually make a compelling pitch start by getting your potential investor excited about your business idea then ease into your request when it seems to arise naturally if the conversation goes well wrap up by explaining that youll shortly be sending a copy of your business plan and a request letter dont try to formalize the loan or investment right then and there if the conversation doesnt go well give them time to review your request and maybe your business plan then follow up to determine what your prospect needs to get to yes document the loan or investment once someone has agreed to participate in financing your business its crucial to get the agreement in writing in the case of a loan you and your lender would draw up a promissory note detailing the amount youll owe your repayment schedule and penalties if you fail to make a payment in the case of an equity investment which assumes that youve set up a corporation or llc you would negotiate a stock purchase

ensure full disclosure and adequate understanding of any terms and conditions with the proper documentation this means having a business plan to share with your family and friend investors as well as adequate legal protection  whether you’re using an investment vehicle or a simple unsecured loanencouraging an investment structure is going to look different than a simple loan convertible debt notes would generally be inappropriate for smaller investments instead i would urge you to consider taking a look at convertible equity as an alternative to traditional convertible debt notes convertible equity vehicles  such as ressi instruments y combinator’s safe agreements or kiss securities  simplify these transactions reduce legal costs and enhance the opportunity for the company’s successyou can read more about how convertible equity works in another piece i recently wrote for an investment of  k however i wouldn’t recommend convertible debt notes since the costs would likely outweigh the benefits of this type of structure typically smaller investments from friends and family are unsecured loans ie there’s no collateral to secure the loan’s repayment again take a look at the convertible equity documents i listed above since they could be more attractive to smaller investors and expand your funding opportunitiesthe necessity to clarify the expectations of your family and friend investors prior to accepting funding can’t be overemphasized since ff investors usually don’t demand sophisticated deal structures you might be expected only to repay the loan on the other hand some might expect higher returns so you should give considerable thought to developing some common key elements critical terms might include defining the equity type eg common stock board seats eg offering seats to leading angels price ownership percentage mechanisms for minimizing dilution and dissolution preferencein order to best protect your company and interests as well as personal relationships it’s highly recommended that you obtain legal guidance which can save you substantial money and hard feelings down the road there is no onesizefitsall in these situations so engaging an attorney is actually an investment in your companyi invite you to check out lawtrades for additional information that can help you make these important decisions about structuring deals for early

founder of new york a…small prefounding  preincorporation investments from friends and relations are typically handled as uncollateralized and by default subordinated and zero interest with no fixed payment schedule personal loans to you or the company or purchases of common stock  a convertible note is a more formal way to do it and in a sense  see below potentially more remunerative to your ff investors the downsides of convertible notesyour legal paperwork has to be in order and the starting point for doing that right is k  thats a minor plus because if you go forward youll have to do the paperwork sooner or later anyway and its smoother and less expensive to do it in the beginning  but on balance paying for routine legal work is not always the best use of your highest risk early money  better spend it building productyour ff isnt likely to negotiate the terms or review the documents as closely as an arms length angel investor  larger angel investors down the road may want different terms which could require you to redraft or tear up the original notewhen you get equity financing from vc or other sophisticated investors and convert all the noteholders to preferred stock those later investors may not want to share the round and its attendant privileges with unsophisticated investors who are closely allied with the foundersif your ff are investing primarily because they want to see you succeed giving them a convertible note leading to stock in a startup doesnt really align with their interests  theyre investing in you not your company  sure they may make a few dollars or even a large sum in a liquidity event  years from now but most likely they will lose it alleven if your company does not pay out it will be a good experience for you and prepare you for your next startup or wherever life takes you  in that sense their investment has succeeded  but if your company fails youll probably feel guilt and responsibility that you owe it to your ff to make them whole  many families break down after a family member spends the family wealth running a business into the ground and feel that they deserve to be paid back  a personal loan captures this real world expectation better than a purchase of stock in the companyby contrast if your business does well and youre a good and generous person youll want to personally reward those who helped you succeed even if its not in the paperwork  within families people often put some of the family business into a trust buy the parents a retirement home or vacation set up a family charity and so on  you can pay it forward by giving the younger family members internships or investing in their own businesses or education  thats all very hard to document in company paperwork via a formal investment scheme  but informally as it becomes clear that your company has a good prospect for success you can ask your lawyer accountant or financial advisor about setting aside some of your founders stock preferably nonvoting common for themmost ff loans arent properly documented so at least use a good loan form  one caveat if your relatives are sophisticated investors or want to be that argues in favor of treating it as an arms length investment  it will help your company resume and theirs as investors if they are early participants  advisors  mentors for another successful startupk views ·
