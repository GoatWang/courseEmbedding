share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since arnas operations board of directors and management will remain subsequent to the consummation of the transaction however the legal aquiror is rasna therapeutics inc as a result the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of arna and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in the transaction with rasna therapeutics inc have been written to fair value in accordance with asc  business combinations refer to note   acquisitions for more information related to the transaction on

plan of reorganization with arna pursuant to the agreement arna was merged into falconridge and the shareholders of arna were issued shares of rasna inc in exchange for shares of arna arna was deemed

its senior management will serve as the senior management of the combined entity further  of the voting interest in rasna inc was acquired in connection with the transaction therefore the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity rasna inc were written to fair value in accordance with the acquisition method prescribed in asc  business combinations the consideration transferred was measured based upon the share price recently received during a nonpublic equity raise in rasna inc during which nonrelated investors paid  per share of common stock during the acquisition transaction  of

therapeutics inc is a biotechnology company that is engaged in modulating the molecular targets npm and lsd which are implicated in the disease progression of leukemia and lymphoma the merger is being treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since substantially all of active with mes operations were disposed of prior to the consummation of the transaction rasna successor is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders control the company after the exchange agreement even though active with me inc was the legal acquirer as a result the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of rasna successor as if rasna successor had always been the reporting company since active with me inc had no operations upon the merger agreement taking place the transaction was treated as a reverse recapitalization for accounting purposes and no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by the company as a result of the merger agreement thereafter pursuant to a stock purchase agreement the company transferred all of the outstanding capital stock of rasna successor to a former officer and director of active with me inc in exchange for cancellation of an aggregate of  shares of rasna successors common stock held by such person in connection with the share exchange each share of rasna inc was exchanged for the right to receive  shares in active with me inc once issued the new shares were combined with the  common shares held by legacy active with me inc shareholders immediately following the merger  shares were canceled which related to one legacy active with me shareholder that effectively spun off the remaining assets of active with me in connection with the transaction finally subsequent to the transaction the legal acquirer executed a  for  stock split on its common shares historical common stock amounts and additional paidin capital have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of the share splits executive in connection with the merger transaction following the closing of the merger and rasna successors cancellation of  shares in the splitoff there were  shares of rasna successor issued and outstanding which once effected for the  for  reverse stock split resulted in  shares outstanding in the combined entity critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap and the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note  accounting policies of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in item  of this quarterly report on form q describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys condensed consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material basis of preparation the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to gaap as found in the accounting standards codification asc and accounting standards updates asu of the financial accounting standards board fasb principles of consolidation in accordance with asc  consolidation the company consolidates any entity in which it has a controlling financial interest further the company consolidates any variable interest entity that it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of and have the power to direct its significant activities upon review of the relationship between rasna therapeutics rasna uk and rasna management noted that equity investment in rasna uk is not sufficient to fund its operations accordingly rasna is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the assets held within rasna uk which primarily consist of cash received from rasna to fund its operations and has power to direct its significant activities as a result rasna consolidates this variable interest entity the interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary arna therapeutics limited as well as the operations of rasna for the period from may   through september   all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements business combinations management accounts for business combinations under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations asc  which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations assets acquired and liabilities assumed including noncontrolling interests are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values asc  also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred the amounts reflected within the note   acquisitions are the results of the preliminary purchase price allocation and will be updated upon completion of the final valuation report management is required to complete the purchase price allocation within  months of the acquisition date if such completion of the allocation results in a change in the preliminary values the measurement period adjustment will be recognized in the period in which the adjustment amount is determined in accordance with asu  going concern the company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other precommercial stage companies including its dependence on key individuals uncertainty of product development and generation of revenues dependence on outside sources of capital risks associated with research development testing and obtaining related regulatory approvals of its pipeline products suppliers and collaborators successful protection of intellectual property competition with larger bettercapitalized companies successful completion of the companys development programs and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities and generating a level of revenues adequate to support the companys cost structure the company has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years and as at september   had an accumulated deficit of  a net loss for the six months ended september   of  and net cash used in operating activities of  we expect to continue to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next twelve months the group has sufficient funds to continue operating until the end of the third quarter of  but will require significant additional cash resources to launch new development phases of existing products in its pipeline these conditions among others raise substantial doubt about the groups ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the group will continue as a going concern this basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the groups assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business a successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of positive cash flows adequate to support the groups cost structure use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to the fair values of stock based awards income taxes and contingent liabilities among others we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations fair value the carrying value of the companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents related party balances accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the shortterm nature of such financial instruments management measures certain other assets including nonmarketable equity securities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of related party receivables deposits held with banks including those held in foreign branches of global banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and bear minimal risk management believes that the institutions that hold our instruments are financially sound and are subject to minimal credit risk cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consists of cash on deposit with banks with an original maturity of three months or less goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets are made up of inprocess research and development iprd and certain intellectual property ip iprd assets represent the fair value assigned to acquired technologies which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use ip assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies which at the time of acquisition have reached technological feasibility however have not yet been put into service intangible assets are considered to have an indefinite useful life until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects at which time they will be amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of their economic or legal useful life goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations goodwill is not amortized rather it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment charge is recognized only when the implied fair value of the companys reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount management evaluates indefinite life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired the ongoing evaluation for impairment of its indefinite life intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment management reviews definite life intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable there were no impairment charges as of the six months ended september   or  risks and uncertainties the company intends to operate in an industry that is subject to rapid change the companys operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial operational technological regulatory and other risks associated with an early stage company including the potential risk of business failure research and development expenditure on research and development is charged to the statements of operation in the year in which it is incurred with the exception of expenditures incurred in respect of the development of major new products where the outcome of those projects is assessed as being reasonably certain in regards to viability and technical feasibility such expenditure is capitalized and amortized straight line over the estimated period of sale for each product commencing in the year that sales of the product are first made to date the company has not capitalized any such expenditures other than certain iprd  ip recorded in connection with certain acquisition or equity transactions income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors a valuation allowance may be established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of the business future changes in income tax law and variances between actual and anticipated operating results management makes certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates the company recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination based on the technical merits of the position the company records a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the companys tax return to the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made to the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision the company incurred no liability and therefore did not need to record interest and penalties during the six months ended september   and  foreign currency items included in the financial statements are measured using their functional currency being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates the financial statements are presented in united states dollar usd which is the companys functional and presentational currency foreign currency transactions are translated using the rate of exchange applicable at the date of the transaction foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation at the year end of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statements of operations net loss per share basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period as of september   and march   there were no common equivalent shares equitybased payments to nonemployees the company offers stockbased compensation awards based on fair value as of the grant date management uses the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant given the limited history with employee grants the simplified method is used for estimating the expected term for stock option awards the simplified method is calculated as the average of the contractual term and the average vesting period estimated volatility is based upon the historical volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available as the company did not have sufficient trading history for its common stock the riskfree interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zerocoupon us treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award the expected dividend assumption is based on the current expectations about the companys anticipated dividend policy the fair value of an award expected to vest on a straightline basis is amortized over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the period from the grant date to the end of the vesting period for awards with service only conditions and a graded vesting schedule management elected to recognize costs on a straightline basis the company uses historical data to estimate the number of future forfeitures results of operations the following paragraphs set forth our results of operations for the periods presented the periodtoperiod comparison
