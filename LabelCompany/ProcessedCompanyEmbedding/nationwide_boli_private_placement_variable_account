services matrix is assistance in the development of ultra high specification offering documents a key document we assist in developing is the disclosure prospectus for the offering – commonly referred to as a private placement memorandum or “ppm” the private placement memorandum serves to disclose critical information to potential investors ensuring they are properly informed regarding the company’s operations investment risks sec disclosures and offering terms prior to investing a private placement memorandum will also have exhibits to disclose additional needed information critical to the investment decision such as historical and projected financials subscription documents related contracts company bylaws and other pertinent supporting data for offerings executed under certain regulation d exemptions the sec has specific regulations that govern what is disclosed to investors regulation d resources has adopted the sec’s form a disclosure standard for use in crafting our regulation d exempt private placement memorandum documents the form a standard is the disclosure standard and disclosure format the sec mandates for certain registered type securities offerings and exceeds what is typically required under a regulation d exempt offering drafting our ppm’s to this standard provides several important benefits to our clients a properly prepared form a spec private placement memorandum protects the client more effectively than the “letter” or summary type offering documents typically prepared by other regulation d preparatory firms form a provides for a very high specification private placement memorandum document which greatly enhances the professionalism of your disclosure package for investors form a is the disclosure standard most brokerdealer firms will require in order to have the offering approved for retail to their investor clients presentation gradetm ppm documentation a unique aspect of our offering documents is the “presentation grade” quality of the private placement memorandum most private placement memorandum documents are comprised of basic text content with minimal presentation quality aspects in fact most lawyers and other preparatory firms use a “speed doc” type process for creating these documents which involves fillintheblank forms and minimal customization and drafting our ppm’s are developed to a standard that far exceeds “typical” and truly enhances the quality of the client’s presentation to investors our presentation grade™ ppm’s are also referred to as “tier  grade” meaning they could be utilized effectively with a tier  level investment bank or brokerdealer our private placement memorandum documents regularly pass compliance and legal review at finra brokerdealer firms as well as applicable state merit compliance review our presentation grade™ ppm’s allow our clients to present an ultra high specification prospectus to investors which dramatically increases the quality and effectiveness of the offering and ensures investors have a high quality professional perception of the client company each presentation grade™ ppm is carefully custom drafted by our expert staff to provide accurate
