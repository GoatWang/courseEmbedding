immunization technology that enables the design and synthesis of nonrecombinant proprietary peptide immunogens combination of a small peptide that activates the immune system with another small peptide from a diseaserelated protein thus a conjugate containing both an immune cell binding ligand icbl and a disease specific epitope which allows the leaps vaccines to activate precursors to differentiate and become more mature cells that can initiate and direct appropriate t cell responses as such readily synthesized defined immunogens can be prepared to different diseases and are likely to elicit protection or therapy as applicable in humans as they are in mice leaps vaccines have promise for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases and for infections
