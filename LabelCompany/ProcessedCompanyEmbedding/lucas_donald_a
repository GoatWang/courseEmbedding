at the beach they are also for tanning but i dont do tanning beds i got these at a random color selection i got hot pink which was what i really wanted they are also hard plastic and comes with tie on elastic bayoudoll i purchased these to use for when i get my uvb light treatments at the dermatologist the light treatment system they use is a stand up one and i needed goggles that had a head band included to keep them in place they work perfectly and are a great value for the price colie m these goggles are flexible and very comfortable they dont let any light in at the corner of your eyes they are far superior to the super sunnies that came with our tanning unit which are rigid hard to adjust to block the light and not comfortable the evo flex sunnies cost a little more but are well worth it   james madigan these are your basic tanning goggles they work exactly as they should and they arrived on time and wellpackaged nothing more could be wanting in this product soufflegirl “oswino” i dont use it for tanning bed but use it while im in the infra red sauna for eye protection to keep my eyes from drying out   j jones comfortable flexible and durable fit my wife and i both like ours strap enables stand up or lying down tanning michael c senisch these glasses worked just fine the size was a little small for a big face but they are supposed to be small they worked as advertised and i would recommend them to anyone steelcomic love the goggles i use them to tan outsidewhen i go to the tanning bed they have their own super fast shipping j stewart came earlier then it said which was great and super cute pink works great used it last night when i went tanning and they were a good price better than in the salon ashlyxoxo there is not too much someone can say about sun tan goggles they work they are comfey and a quick delivery good buy for me jack g i ordered these on a friday and received them the following wednesday they are way cheaper than buying them at a tanning place and with free shipping you cant beat it i was looking for goggles with the option for elastic so i can use them in a stand up booth and these are exactly what i wanted jessica my husband and i use these for our afternoon cat naps and they work just fine at keeping out the light  much better than the eye shades one gets from airlines for example which allow light in from the edges the strap needs to be adjusted properly to keep the goggles on without pressing them too tightly against the face still theyre the best napping eye shades weve yet come across karen a amrhein so glad that i got them they work great and are dark i am very satisfied would buy these again amandaj these came just as described they are just what i needed i see no tanning light with them on they fit my eyes perfect the old sunnies just didnt cut it they didnt form to my eyes at all these work great tnmel i love my super sunnies not only did i get a purple pair but i also got them like two days later plus they werent super expensive and they do a great job at keeping the light out of my eyes i am actually about to order my sis in law a pair too 🙂 bonita start to shopcleaning products lucas® salon and

purchased the book for their children and the kids loved it highly recommend this and other books written by ms donald read more top critical reviewsee the critical review›  out of  starsthe tale the tracks tell is sketchybybob walchon february  although i liked the approach the author used focusing on what dinosaur tracks can tell us but i was not impressed by the execution of the idea granted this little paperback is intended for young readers grades k but the attempt at rhyming the text wasnt that effective and was perhaps even limiting in setting forth the concrete facts that were being conveyed here i think a nonrhymed presentation would have allowed the author to offer a greater range of hard facts and details a second concern i have involved some of the illustrations they were adequate but they were also a little too busy for my liking given this book was for the younger set and a few of them were actually a little scary i wouldnt be surprised if i read this paperback to my granddaughter and she was a little taken back by some of the pictures the last thing i want is to have an innocent story reading session result in a nightmare or two id suggest checking out this book at the local library first before making a purchase on the other hand it is rather inexpensive so if you do buy it sight unseen and its not to your liking you can perhaps donate it to a school or local library this book was supplied by the publisher read more sort by topmost recenttopfilter by all reviewersverified purchase onlyverified purchase onlyall stars star only star only star only star

he has no intention of taking any time off now lucas says he simply can’t find anyone else to run his californiabased lucas oil products inc the way he can he founded the company which sells fuel and oil additives and other automotive products in  the hoosier native and former truck driver paid  million to put the lucas oil name on the home of the indianapolis colts for  years what’s your education level i graduated high school then went to a long college called hard knocks do you feel like you missed out on anything by not going to college not really i don’t know what i would have studied i thought i might have wanted to be a lawyer but there was no way i could afford to go to college so instead i bought my first truck when i was  and my first semi when i was  sometimes college can work against you i learned to make oil because i was a good mechanic and knew i needed a better oil by working and learning how to make oil on my own i was able to think outside the box if i had gone to school i would have never done what i’ve done how did you get into the trucking business i was working in a factory—the night shift—and driving a dump truck by day i already had kids and i didn’t want to spend the rest of my life in a factory i wanted to have my own business i figured i had to get some money ahead to do it i was fascinated with trucks and trucking and wanted to see the country i saved up enough money to live for a few months so i could transition into the trucking company and went to work for mayflower i bought a truck went through training and went out and made a lot more money than they thought i could i was working night and day and living cheap unfortunately my first wife blew the money as fast as it came in in two or three years i thought i’d be able to save enough money sell the truck and start a gas station or something like that it never happened i had to divorce my first wife and start life over again and i later ended up with a fleet of trucks what’s the average work day for forrest lucas i still work  hours a day i’m on call all the time and virtually every weekend i’m at a sporting event or some other kind of event our company is involved in—either we’re sponsoring it or hosting something the company is still growing and there’s so many things i can do that i can’t find anyone else who can do in a few sentences what’s your business philosophy be absolutely honest with everybody people like doing business with somebody they can trust don’t be in debt work yourself to death and get cash in your pocket when you have cash that’s when the bargains come along and treat your people the way you want to be treated share the good will with them … and you’ll have good people what’s your management style i try to run the whole company like a big team there aren’t a lot of levels of bosses but if you get out of line you’ll find you have a boss i don’t have a temper and i’m pretty laidback but when it comes down to it i am the top boss here who are your role models business or personal i only had one sports hero and that’s larry bird i liked the way he lived his life he made it to the top and is still a really nice guy as far as business i don’t follow anybody i do my own thing what’s your politics i’m a republican what are your thoughts on donald trump as a presidential candidate he certainly is a surprise he’s saying a lot of things a lot of people want to hear a lot of people are discouraged with the house and senate members for letting the president get by with all the things he’s gotten away with they want a change what trump is doing is a technique i’ve never before seen would you be comfortable with trump getting the republican nomination it would be like when obama got elected i’d say “i don’t really like it but i have no choice and i’ll have to make the best of it” i could never have been more disappointed with any one human being than i have been with obama there are a lot of other potential disappointers out there so i do hope we can get this straightened out it is a bit of a problem because trump has such a toehold do you think a guy with a business background but not a political one can make a good president absolutely i think a good person with good business sense could come in there and surround himself with good people where did you take your last vacation i’ve
