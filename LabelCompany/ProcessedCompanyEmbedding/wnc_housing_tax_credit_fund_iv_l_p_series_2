housing and in certain cases california lowincome housing tax credits low income housing credits the general partner of the partnership is wnc tax credit partners iv lp tcp iv the general partner of tcp iv is wnc  associates inc associates the chairman and president of associates owns substantially all of the outstanding stock of associates the business of the partnership is conducted primarily through associates as neither tcp iv nor the partnership have employees of their own pursuant to a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on october   the partnership commenced a public offering of  units of limited partnership interest units at a price of  per unit the partnerships offering terminated on july   a total of  limited partnership interests representing  had been sold holders of limited partnership interests are referred to herein as limited partners the partnership shall continue to be in full force and effect until december   unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the partnership agreement or law description of business the partnerships principal business objective is to provide its limited partners with low income housing credits the partnerships principal business therefore consists of investing as a limited partner or nonmanaging member in local limited partnerships each of which owns and operates a multifamily housing complex the housing complexes which qualify for the low income housing credits in general under section  of the internal revenue code an owner of lowincome housing can receive the low income housing credit to be used to reduce federal taxes otherwise due in each year of a tenyear period in general under section  of the california revenue and taxation code an owner of lowincome housing can receive the california low income housing credit to be used against california taxes otherwise due in each year of a fouryear period each housing complex is subject to a fifteenyear compliance period the compliance period and under state law may have to be maintained as low income housing for  or more years in general in order to avoid recapture of low income housing credits the partnership does not expect that it will dispose of its interests in local limited partnerships local limited partnership interests or approve the sale by any local limited partnership of its housing complex prior to the end of the applicable compliance period because of i the nature of the housing complexes ii the difficulty of predicting the resale market for lowincome housing  or more years in the future and iii the ability of government lenders to disapprove of transfer it is not possible at this time to predict whether the liquidation of the partnerships assets and the disposition of the proceeds if any in accordance with the partnerships agreement of limited partnership dated may   the partnership agreement will be able to be accomplished promptly at the end of the year period if a local limited partnership is unable to sell its housing complex it is anticipated that the local general partner local general partner will either continue to operate such housing complex or take such other actions as the local general partner believes to be in the best interest of the local limited partnership notwithstanding the preceding circumstances beyond the control of the general partner or the local general partners may occur during the compliance period which would require the partnership to approve the disposition of a housing complex prior to the end thereof possibly resulting in recapture of low income housing credits  pkth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th as of march   the partnership had invested in twentyone local limited partnerships each of these local limited partnerships owns a housing complex that is eligible for the federal low income housing credit certain local limited partnerships may also benefit from government programs promoting low or moderateincome housing certain risks and uncertainties an investment in the partnership and the partnerships investments in local limited partnerships and their housing complexes are subject to risks these risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the partnership and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to the limited partners if any on liquidation of the partnerships investments some of those risks include the following the low income housing credit rules are extremely complicated noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future low income housing credits and the fractional recapture of low income housing credits already taken an individual limited partners ability to use tax credits is limited in most cases the annual amount of low income housing credits that an individual limited partner can use is limited to the tax liability due on the persons last  of taxable income low income housing credits may be the only material benefit from the partnership because limited partners may not get back their capital any transactions between the partnership and associates and its affiliates will entail conflicts of interest the partnership has invested in a limited number of local limited partnerships such limited diversity means that the results of operation of each single housing complex will have a greater impact on the partnership with limited diversity poor performance of one housing complex could impair the partnerships ability to satisfy its investment objectives each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness if a local limited partnership failed to pay its mortgage it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure if foreclosure were to occur during the first  years the loss of any remaining future low income housing credits and a fractional recapture of prior low income housing credits would occur at any time a foreclosure would result in a loss of the partnerships investment in the housing complex the partnership is a limited partner or nonmanaging member of each local limited partnership accordingly the partnership will have very limited rights with respect to management of the local limited partnerships the partnership will rely totally on the local general partners neither the partnerships investments in local limited partnerships nor the local limited partnerships investments in housing complexes are readily marketable to the extent the housing complexes receive government financing or operating subsidies they may be subject to one or more of the following risks difficulties in obtaining tenants for the housing complexes difficulties in obtaining rent increases limitations on cash distributions limitations on sales or refinancing of housing complexes limitations on transfers of interests in local limited partnerships limitations on removal of local general partners limitations on subsidy programs and possible changes in applicable regulations uninsured casualties could result in loss of property and low income housing credits and recapture of low income housing credits previously taken the value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions including employment rates inflation tax environmental land use and zoning policies supply and demand of similar properties and neighborhood conditions among others the ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from the partnership is limited the irs may audit the partnership or a local limited partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items the amount of low income housing credits and tax losses allocable to the limited partners could be reduced if the irs were successful in such a challenge the alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the partnership changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the partnership andor the value of the housing complexes there are limits on the transferability of units including a prohibition on the transfer of more than  of the units in a month period no trading market for the units exists or is expected to develop limited partners may be unable to sell their units except at a discount and should consider their units to be a longterm investment individual limited partners will have no recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the majority of limited partners substantially all of the low income housing credits anticipated to be realized from the local limited partnerships have been realized the partnership does not anticipate being allocated a significant amount of low income housing credits from the local limited partnerships in the future until the local limited partnerships have completed the  year low

pkth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th method of accounting for investments in limited partnerships the partnership accounts for its investments in limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting whereby the partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the local limited partnerships results of operations and for any contributions made and distributions received the partnership reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a local limited partnership for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may not be recoverable recoverability of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by management generally consisting of the product of the remaining future lowincome housing credits estimated to be allocable to the partnership and the estimated residual value to the partnership if an investment is considered to be impaired the partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any such local limited partnership the accounting policies of the local limited partnerships generally are expected to be consistent with those of the partnership costs incurred by the partnership in acquiring the investments are capitalized as part of the investment account and are being amortized over  years notes  and  equity in losses of limited partnerships for each year ended march  have been recorded by the partnership based on nine months of reported results provided by the local limited partnerships for each year ended december  and on three months of results estimated by management of the partnership managements estimate for the threemonth period is based on either actual unaudited results reported by the local limited partnerships or historical trends in the operations of the local limited partnerships equity in losses from the local limited partnerships allocated to the partnership are not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would be adjusted below zero as soon as the investment balance reaches zero amortization of the related costs of acquiring the investment are accelerated to the extent of losses available distributions received from the local limited partnerships are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance distributions received after the investment has reached zero are recognized as income if the local limited partnerships report net income in future years the partnership will resume applying the equity method only after its share of such net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the periods the equity method was suspended income taxes no provision for income taxes has been recorded in the financial statements as any liability andor benefits

an investment in the partnership and the partnerships investments in local limited partnerships and their housing complexes are subject to risks these risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the partnership and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to the limited partners if any on liquidation of the partnerships investments some of those risks include the following the low income housing credit rules are extremely complicated noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future low income housing credit s and the fractional recapture of low income housing credits already taken in most cases the annual amount of low income housing credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the persons last  of taxable income the local limited partnerships may be unable to sell the housing complexes at a price which would result in the partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction accordingly the partnership may be unable to distribute any cash to its limited partners low income housing credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the partnership the partnership has invested in a limited number of local limited partnerships such limited diversity means that the results of operation of each single housing complex will have a greater impact on the partnership with limited  pkth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th diversity poor performance of one housing complex could impair the partnerships ability to satisfy its investment objectives each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness if a local limited partnership failed to pay its mortgage it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure if foreclosure were to occur during the first  years the loss of any remaining future low income housing credits a fractional recapture of prior low income housing credits and a loss of the partnerships investment in the housing complex would occur the partnership is a limited partner or nonmanaging member of each local limited partnership accordingly the partnership will have very limited rights with respect to management of the local limited partnerships the partnership will rely totally on the local general partners neither the partnerships investments in local limited partnerships nor the local limited partnerships investments in housing complexes are readily marketable to the extent the housing complexes receive government financing or operating subsidies they may be subject to one or more of the following risks difficulties in obtaining tenants for the housing complexes difficulties in obtaining rent increases limitations on cash distributions limitations on sales or refinancing of housing complexes limitations on transfers of interests in local limited partnerships limitations on removal of local general partners limitations on subsidy programs and possible changes in applicable regulations uninsured casualties could result in loss of property and low income housing credits and recapture of low income housing credits previously taken the value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions including employment rates inflation tax environmental land use and zoning policies supply and demand of similar properties and neighborhood conditions among others the ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from the partnership is limited the irs may audit the partnership or a local limited partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items the amount of low income housing credits and tax losses allocable to the limited partners could be reduced if the irs were successful in such a challenge the alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the partnership changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the partnership andor the value of the housing complexes substantially all of the low income housing credits anticipated to be realized from the local limited partnerships have been realized the partnership does not anticipate being allocated a significant amount of low income housing credits

only benefit from an investment in the partnership the partnership has invested in a limited number of local limited partnerships such limited diversity means that the results of operation of each single housing complex will have a greater impact on the partnership with limited diversity poor performance of one housing complex could impair the partnerships ability to satisfy its investment objectives each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness if a local limited partnership failed to pay its mortgage it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure if foreclosure were to occur during the first  years the loss of any remaining future low income housing credits a fractional recapture of prior low income housing credits and a loss of the partnerships investment in the housing complex would occur the partnership is a limited partner or nonmanaging member of each local limited partnership accordingly the partnership will have very limited rights with respect to management of the local limited partnerships the partnership will rely totally on the local general partners neither the partnerships investments in local limited partnerships nor the local limited partnerships investments in housing complexes are readily marketable to the extent the housing complexes receive government financing or operating subsidies they may be subject to one or more of the following risks difficulties in obtaining tenants for the housing complexes difficulties in obtaining rent increases limitations on cash distributions limitations on sales or refinancing of housing complexes limitations on transfers of interests in local limited partnerships limitations on removal of local general partners limitations on subsidy programs and possible changes in applicable regulations uninsured casualties could result in loss of property and low income housing credits and recapture of low income housing credits previously taken the value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions including employment rates inflation tax environmental land use and zoning policies supply and demand of similar properties and neighborhood conditions among others the ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from the partnership is limited the irs may audit the partnership or a local limited partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items the amount of low income housing credits and tax losses allocable to the limited partners could be reduced if the irs were successful in such a challenge the alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the partnership changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the partnership andor the value of the housing complexes substantially all of the low income housing credits anticipated to be realized from the local limited partnerships have been realized the partnership does not anticipate being allocated a significant amount of low income housing credits from the local limited partnerships in the future until the local limited partnerships have completed the  year low income housing credit compliance period risks exist for

compliance period for lowincome housing tax credit properties is generally  years from occupancy following construction or rehabilitation completion wnc was one of the first in the industry to offer investments using the tax credit now these very first programs are completing their compliance period with that in mind the partnership is continuing to review the partnerships holdings with special emphasis on the more mature properties including those that have satisfied the irs compliance requirements the partnerships review will consider many factors including extended use requirements on the property such as those due to mortgage restrictions or state compliance agreements the condition of the property and the tax consequences to the limited partners from the sale of the property upon identifying those properties with the highest potential for a successful sale refinancing or syndication the partnership expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate those properties the partnerships objective is to maximize the limited partners return wherever possible and ultimately to wind down those funds that no longer provide tax benefits to limited partners to date no properties in the partnership have been selected method of accounting for investments in limited partnerships  the partnership accounts for its investments in limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting whereby the partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the local limited partnerships results of operations and for any contributions made and distributions received the partnership reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a local limited partnership for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may not be recoverable recoverability of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by management generally consisting of the product of the remaining future lowincome housing credits estimated to be allocable to the partnership and the estimated residual value to the partnership if an investment is considered to be impaired the partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any such local limited partnership the accounting policies of the local limited partnerships generally are expected to be consistent with those of the partnership costs

wnc housing tax credit fund iv lp series  the “partnership” is a california limited partnership formed under the laws of the state of california on may   and commenced operations on october    the partnership was formed to acquire limited partnership interests in other limited partnerships local limited partnerships which own multifamily housing complexes “housing complexes” that are eligible for federal low income housing tax credits “low income housing tax credits”  the local general partners the “local general partners” of each local limited partnership retain responsibility for maintaining operating and managing the housing complex each local limited partnership is governed by its agreement of limited partnership the “local limited partnership agreement” the general partner of the partnership is wnc tax credit partners iv lp “tcp iv” or the “general partner” the general partner of tcp iv is wnc  associates inc “associates” the chairman and the president of associates owns all of the outstanding stock of associates the business of the partnership is conducted primarily through the general partner as the partnership has no employees of its own the partnership shall continue in full force and effect until december   unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the partnership agreement or law the financial statements include only activity relating to the business of the partnership and do not give effect to any assets that the partners may have outside of their interests in the partnership or to any obligations including income taxes of the partners the partnership agreement authorized the sale of up to  units of limited partnership interest “partnership units” at  per partnership unit  the offering of partnership units had concluded in july  at which time  partnership units representing subscriptions in the amount of  had been accepted  the general partner has a  interest in operating profits and losses taxable income and losses cash available for distribution from the partnership and low income housing tax credits of the partnership  the investors the “limited partners” in the partnership will be allocated the remaining  of these items in proportion to their respective investments      wnc housing tax credit fund iv lp series   a california limited partnership notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended june   unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued the proceeds from the disposition of any of the local limited partnership’s housing complexes will be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective local limited partnership agreement any remaining proceeds will then be paid to the partnership the sale of a housing complex may be subject to other restrictions and obligations accordingly there can be no assurance that a local limited partnership will be able to sell its housing complex even if it does so there can be no assurance that any significant amounts of cash will be distributed to the partnership should such distributions occur the limited partners will be entitled to receive distributions from the proceeds remaining after payment of partnership obligations and funding reserves equal to their capital contributions and their return on investment as defined in the partnership agreement and the general partner would then be entitled to receive proceeds equal to its capital contributions from the remainder any additional sale or refinancing proceeds will be distributed  to the limited partners in proportion to their respective investments and  to the general partner risks and uncertainties an investment in the partnership and the partnership’s investments in local limited partnerships and their housing complexes are subject to risks these risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the partnership and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to the limited partners if any on liquidation of the partnership’s investments some of those risks include the following the low income housing tax credits rules are extremely complicated noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future low income housing tax credits and the fractional recapture of low income housing tax credits already taken in most cases the annual amount of low income housing tax credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person’s last  of taxable income the local limited partnerships may be unable to sell the housing complexes at a price which would result in the partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction accordingly the partnership may be unable to distribute any cash to its limited partners low income housing tax credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the partnership the partnership has invested in a limited number of local limited partnerships such limited diversity means that the results of operation of each single housing complex will have a greater impact on the partnership with limited diversity poor performance of one housing complex could impair the partnership’s ability to satisfy its investment objectives each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness if a local limited partnership failed to pay its mortgage it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure if foreclosure were to occur during the first  years the “compliance period” the loss of any remaining future low income housing tax credits a fractional recapture of prior low income housing tax credits and a loss of the partnership’s investment in the housing complex would occur the partnership is a limited partner or a nonmanaging member of each local limited partnership accordingly the partnership will have very limited rights with respect to management of the local limited partnerships the partnership will rely totally on the local general partners neither the partnership’s investments in local limited partnerships nor the local limited partnerships’ investments in housing complexes are readily marketable to the extent the housing complexes receive government financing or operating subsidies they may be subject to one or more of the following risks difficulties in obtaining tenants for the housing complexes difficulties in obtaining rent increases limitations on cash distributions limitations on sales or refinancing of housing complexes limitations on transfers of interests in local limited partnerships limitations on removal of local general partners limitations on subsidy programs and possible changes in applicable regulations uninsured casualties could result in loss of property and low income housing tax credits and recapture of low income housing tax credits previously taken the value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions including employment rates inflation tax environmental land use and zoning policies supply and demand of similar housing complexes and neighborhood conditions among others      wnc housing tax credit fund iv lp series   a california limited partnership notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended june   unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued the ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from the partnership is limited the irs may audit the partnership or a local limited partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items the amount of low income housing tax credits and tax losses allocable to limited partners could be reduced if the irs were successful in such a challenge the alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the partnership changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the partnership andor the value of the housing complexes all of the low income housing tax credits anticipated to be realized from the local limited partnerships have been realized the partnership does not anticipate being allocated any low income housing tax credits from the local limited partnerships in the future until the local limited partnerships have completed the compliance period risks exist for potential recapture of prior low income housing tax credits received no trading market for the partnership units exists or is expected to develop limited partners may be unable to sell their partnership units except at a discount and should consider their partnership units to be a longterm investment individual limited partners will have no recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the majority of limited partners the partnership currently has insufficient working capital to fund its operations associates has agreed to continue providing advances sufficient enough to fund the operations and working capital requirements of the partnership through august   anticipated future and existing cash resources of the partnership are not sufficient to pay existing liabilities of the partnership however substantially all of the existing liabilities of the partnership are payable to the general partner andor its affiliates though the amounts payable to the general partner andor its affiliates are contractually currently payable the partnership anticipates that the general partner andor its affiliates will not require the payment of these contractual obligations until capital reserves are in excess of the aggregate of then existing contractual obligations and then anticipated future foreseeable obligations of the partnership the partnership would be adversely affected should the general partner andor its affiliates demand current payment of the existing contractual obligations and or suspend services for this or any other reason exit strategy the compliance period for a housing complex is generally  years following construction or rehabilitation completion associates was one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in low income housing tax credits  the initial programs have completed their compliance periods upon the sale of a local limited partnership interest or housing complex after the end of the compliance period there would be no recapture of low income housing tax credits  a sale prior to the end of the compliance period could result in recapture if certain conditions are not met  twenty of the housing complexes have completed their compliance period with that in mind the general partner is continuing its review of the housing complexes the review considers many factors including extended use requirements such as those due to mortgage restrictions or state compliance agreements the condition of the housing complexes and the tax consequences to the limited partners from the sale of the housing complexes      wnc housing tax credit fund iv lp series   a california limited partnership notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended june   unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued upon identifying those housing complexes with the highest potential for a successful sale refinancing or resyndication the partnership expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them the objective is to maximize the limited partners’ return wherever possible and ultimately to wind down the partnership as low income housing tax credits are no longer available local limited partnership interests may be disposed of any time by the general partner in its discretion  while liquidation of the housing complexes continues to be evaluated the dissolution of the partnership was not imminent as of june   upon management of the partnership identifying a local limited partnership for disposition costs incurred by the partnership in preparation for the disposition are deferred upon the sale of the local limited partnership interest the partnership nets the costs that had been deferred against the proceeds from the sale in determining the gain or loss on sale of the local limited partnership deferred disposition costs are included in other assets on the balance sheets on march   the partnership filed preliminary consent solicitation materials with the securities and exchange commission “sec” regarding the adoption of a plan of liquidation  definitive materials were filed with the sec on april    materials were disseminated to the limited partners on april    the partnership sought approval to have a formal plan of liquidation of selling its limited partnership interests or selling the underlying housing complexes of each of the local limited partnerships on june   the partnership received the majority vote in favor of the plan for dissolution the partnership has received the majority vote in favor of the plan of liquidation of the partnership  therefore the partnership is engaging third party appraisers to appraise several or all of the local limited partnerships in this partnership  the appraisal is one of the preliminary steps that need to be completed in order to move forward with the approved liquidation plan  the

accounts for its investments in local limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting whereby the partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the local limited partnerships’ results of operations and for any contributions made and distributions received the partnership reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a local limited partnership for possible impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may not be recoverable recoverability of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by management generally consisting of the sum of the remaining future low income housing tax credits estimated to be allocable to the partnership and the estimated residual value to the partnership if an investment is considered to be impaired the partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any such local limited partnership the accounting policies of the local limited partnerships generally are expected to be consistent with those of the partnership costs incurred by the partnership in acquiring the investments are capitalized as part of the investment account and were amortized over  years see note       wnc housing tax credit fund iv lp series   a california limited partnership notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended june   unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued “equity in losses of local limited partnerships” for the periods ended june   and  has been recorded by the partnership management’s estimate for the threemonth period is based on either actual unaudited results reported by the local limited partnerships or historical trends in the operations of the local limited partnerships in subsequent annual financial statements upon receiving the actual annual results reported by the local limited partnerships management reverses its prior estimate and records the actual results reported by the local limited partnerships equity in losses of local limited partnerships allocated to the partnership are not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would be adjusted below zero if the local limited partnerships report net income in future years the partnership will resume applying the equity method only after its share of such net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the periods the equity method was suspended see note    in accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities the partnership determines when it should include the assets liabilities and activities of a variable interest entity vie in its financial statements and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a vie the analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a vie focuses on control and economic factors a vie is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has  the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and  the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie if multiple unrelated parties share such power as defined no party will be required to consolidate the vie further the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on this guidance the local limited partnerships in which the partnership invests meet the definition of a vie because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations however management does not consolidate the partnerships interests in these vies as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities the partnership currently records the amount of its investment in these local limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements the partnerships balance in investment in local limited partnerships plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments represents its maximum exposure to loss the partnerships exposure to loss on these local limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the local general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors in the partnership distributions received by the partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance distributions received after the investment has reached zero are recognized as income as of all periods presented all of the investment balances had reached zero use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could materially differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents the partnership considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents as of june   and march   the partnership had no cash equivalents      wnc housing tax credit fund iv lp series   a california limited partnership notes to condensed financial

rather all items of taxable income deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns the partnership’s federal tax status as a passthrough entity is based on its legal status as a partnership accordingly the partnership is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a passthrough entity the partnership is required to file and does file tax returns with the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities accordingly these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the

changes in september  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting guidance for fair value measurements which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and shall be applied prospectively except for very limited transactions  in february  the fasb delayed for one year implementation of the guidance as it pertains to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities the partnership adopted gaap for fair value measurements effective april   except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which the effective date was april   the partnership has determined that adoption of this guidance had no material impact on the partnership’s financial statements in november  the fasb issued accounting guidance on equity method investment accounting considerations that addresses how the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be determined how an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinitelived intangible asset of an equity method investment should be performed how an equity method investee’s issuance of shares should be accounted for and how to account for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method this guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years the partnership adopted the guidance for the interim quarterly period beginning april   the impact of adopting it did not have a material impact on the partnership’s financial condition or results of operations in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance for interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  this requires disclosure about the method and significant assumptions used to establish the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as annual statements  it became effective for as of and for the interim period ended june   and had no impact on the partnership’s financial condition or results of operations in may  the fasb issued guidance regarding subsequent events which was subsequently updated in february  this guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued in particular this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance

  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   partnership for the quarter ended june   the adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that the partnership reports either through recognition or disclosure in the financial statements in february  the fasb amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events alleviating conflicts with current sec guidance this amendment was effective immediately and therefore the partnership did not include the disclosure in this form q   in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies  the amended guidance modified the consolidation model to one based on control and economics and replaced quantitative primary beneficiary analysis with a qualitative analysis the primary beneficiary of a vie will be the entity that has  the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and  the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie  if multiple unrelated parties share such power as defined no party will be required to consolidate the vie further the amended guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a vie and adds an additional reconsideration event for determination of whether an entity is a vie  additionally the amendment requires enhanced and expanded disclosures around vies  this amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after november    the adoption of this guidance on april   did not have a material effect on the partnership’s financial statements in june  the fasb issued the accounting standards codification codification  effective july   the codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap  the codification is intended to reorganize
