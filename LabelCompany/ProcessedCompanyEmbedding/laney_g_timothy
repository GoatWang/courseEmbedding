never been common if it were the world would be a different place things would run smoothly and on time people would do what they say and say what they do everything would be fair without all the small type and banks would only sell you what you need when your banker looked at you they wouldnt just see a number theyd see a dad or a mom or a graduate or a business owner theyd understand the complexities of peoples lives and offer simple solutions thats why we bank with common sense and we invite you to do the same that means straight talk personal attention and sensible clear decisions from real people no jibber jabber no smoke and mirrors and no passing the buck and no making you talk to a machine when what you need is a person if that makes sense to you then you might be right for us and we might be right for you where common sense lives for more information please view the video below   our community service   weve been told time again that getting the fundamentals right is the best way we can help the community but were not satisfied with that answer wed like to help in other ways too thats why as a bank and as individuals we put aside some time and money to help out here are a few things we do we help people understand money its just common sense that people who understand what theyre signing make better decisions so we dedicate a portion of our time to providing
