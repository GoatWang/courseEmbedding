and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the companys audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report critical accounting policies and estimates the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the following critical accounting policies are a subset of the companys significant accounting policies described in note  of the notes to financial statements not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates property and equipment the companys rail operations are highly capital intensive property and equipment including land held for development is stated at historical cost including selfconstruction costs selfconstruction costs for track structure include material costs for ties rail other track materials and ballast the cost of direct and supervisory labor including railroad retirement taxes and employee benefits costs for track machinery and equipment including depreciation and various other overhead costs major renewals or betterments are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend asset lives are charged to expense when incurred costs are capitalized to the extent that they are incurred in connection with the replacement of track structure pursuant to a program of rehabilitation which results in significant future economic benefit or with the construction of new track structure a program of rehabilitation or construction of new track structure generally includes ballast rail and other track material and ties costs for routine maintenance are expensed routine maintenance items include the sporadic replacement of ties replacement of track structure damaged in a derailment washout or other cause or event and the costs of general upkeep of track structure to keep it in good operating condition costs are capitalized or expensed depending on the facts and circumstances of each specific project the total amount of the costs to be capitalized is based on the per unit cost for each category of expenditure ties rail and other track material and ballast and the number of equivalent units installed costs are developed using costs incurred for materials direct labor and overhead property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over their useful lives items included in track structures with similar physical characteristics use date of installation and expected life are grouped together into separate asset classes and depreciated by the estimated useful life for the asset class group gains or losses if any on sales or other dispositions of property are credited or charged to other income the company reviews property and equipment retirements each year in order to determine whether or not the estimated useful lives are reasonable since in most instances assets retired have been fully or substantially depreciated the company has not found it necessary historically to make any significant adjustments to their estimated useful lives retirements of track structures are recorded by removing the historical cost and related accumulated depreciation of its oldest track structures with the related loss if any being charged to other income historically the company has not had any significant retirements of track infrastructure which it considers to be abnormal and not in the normal course of business the conclusions and ongoing evaluations of our estimated useful lives may result in future material changes in the companys maintenance and capital spending as well as revisions to the useful lives of property and equipment which may affect depreciation rates and expenses the company evaluates longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that assets should be evaluated for possible impairment the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the assets in determining whether the carrying amounts of the assets are recoverable if an impairment exists the impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value to the fair value no impairments were recognized in the two years presented ii income taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the dates of enactment valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized overview the company is a freight railroad operating in massachusetts rhode island connecticut and new york the company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines freight revenues are estimated and recorded at the time shipments move onto the companys track modest freightrelated operating revenues

consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits depreciation insurance and casualty claim expense diesel fuel car hire property taxes materials and supplies purchased services track usage fees and other expenses many of the companys operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the companys management were to take specific actions to restructure the companys operations when comparing the companys results of operations from one year to another the following factors should be taken into consideration first the company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one�time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shutdowns second the companys freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in international national and regional economic conditions third the volume of capitalized track or recollectible projects performed by the companys maintenance of way department can vary significantly from year to year thereby impacting total operating expenses fourth diesel fuel comprises a significant portion of the companys operating costs as fuel prices increase the company attempts to recover these costs through surcharges and increased fees however the companys profitability can be impacted by increases or decreases in fuel prices the company also generates other income through sales of properties grants of easements and licenses other income or loss from the sale condemnation disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements and rights to use portions of its property is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectability is assured other income varies significantly from year to year one of the companys customers which mines construction aggregates from two active quarries on the companys rail system and ships to destinations in connecticut and new york accounted for more than  of the companys freight operating revenues in  and  the company does not believe that the customer

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
