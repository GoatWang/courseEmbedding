adiponectin and interleukin il in insulintreated diabetic rats with or without periodontitis forty male wistar rats were randomly divided into  groups  rats each a insulintreated diabetic group control di and b insulintreated diabetic periodontitis group test dip diabetes was induced and insulin treatment was initiated on day  on day  periodontitis was induced in the dip group all rats were euthanized on day  adiponectin and il were assessed on days  and  at the end of the experiment  and  rats survived in the di and dip groups respectively adiponectin levels were statistically significantly higher at the end of the experiment compared with levels on day  in the periodontitis group p   but not in the control group at the end of the experiment adiponectin levels were statistically significantly higher in the periodontitis group compared with the control group p   withingroup and betweengroup comparisons of il levels showed no statistically significant difference in conclusion serum adiponectin was increased in insulintreated diabetic rats with periodontitis in comparison with insulintreated diabetic rats while il levels did not differ between groups

athens greece contributed equally to the study purpose to describe the pharmacokinetics of intravitreal bevacizumab avastin  in rabbits methods the right eye of  rabbits was injected intravitreally with  mg ml bevacizumab both eyes of four rabbits each time were enucleated at days     and  bevacizumab concentrations were measured in serum aqueous humor and vitreous results maximum vitreous  μgml and aqueous humor  μgml concentrations of bevacizumab in the right eye were measured at day  serum bevacizumab concentration peaked at day   μgml and declined to  μgml at  weeks halflife values in right vitreous right aqueous humor and serum were   and  days respectively concentration of bevacizumab in the vitreous of the noninjected eye peaked at day   ngml and declined to  ngml at  weeks in the aqueous humor of the noninjected eye maximum concentration of bevacizumab was achieved at day   ngml and declined to  ngml at  weeks conclusion the vitreous halflife of  mg ml intravitreal bevacizumab was  days in this rabbit model maximum concentrations of bevacizumab were reached at day  in both vitreous and aqueous humor of the right eye and at day  in the serum very low concentrations of bevacizumab were measured in the fellow noninjected eye     the effect of autologous plateletrich plasma on bronchial stump tissue granulation after pneumonectomy experimental study eleftherios spartalisperiklis tomospetros konofaosgrigorios karagkiouzisgeorgia levidounikolaos kavantzasalkistis pantopoulouothon michaildespina perreagregory kouraklis isrn surgery   doi  abstract objectives recent advances in perioperative management antibiotics and surgical materials including mechanical staplers have decreased the operative risk of pulmonary resection however bronchopleural fistula can still occur in some instances the occurrence often being lethal this study investigated whether plateletrich plasma prp promotes granulation of the bronchial stump after pneumonectomy methods ten pigs were randomized into two groups a control or nonprp group pneumonectomy and b prp group pneumonectomy and prp application prp was obtained by spinning down the animal’s own blood and collecting the buffy coat containing platelets and white blood cells results increased platelet concentration triggered the healing process the percentage of granulation tissue formed at the stumps was significantly higher in the prp group of animals this observation was confirmed when statistical analysis using mannwhitney u test was performed   conclusions prp is easily produced with minimal basic equipment and is useful in accelerating granulation of the bronchial stump although the timing and optimum number of applications in humans require further study autologous prp is a safe feasible and reliable new healing promoter with potential therapeutic effects  introduction since the first pneumonectomy performed by graham and singer in   the mortality of this procedure has decreased progressively  the improvements in the surgical technique have contributed significantly to this decrease although parallel declines in the incidence of bronchopleural fistula bpf have been reported this complication remains a major concern for the thoracic surgeon with associated high morbidity and mortality rates  most bronchial stump fistulas appear early after pneumonectomy  one of the promising but clinically challenging areas of therapeutic advances involves the topical application of growth factors to enhance normal healing a new strategy to better support and promote the woundhealing cascade is to prepare an autologous platelet concentrate suspended in plasma plateletrich plasma prp for application to wound sites in a wide variety of surgeries the therapeutic effects of prp are believed to result from the elevated levels of growth factors for example plateletderived growth factor pdgf  using a porcine model this study evaluated the feasibility of generating prp with gravitational platelet separation and investigated the granulation process after application on the bronchial stump  material and      每显示      home copyright   open access library all rights
