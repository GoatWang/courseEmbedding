jacksonville for petitioner dennis r schutt and jeffrey d devonchik of schutt schmidt  noey jacksonville for respondent petitioner heartland express inc seeks certiorari review of an order compelling disclosure of information concerning its risk management investigation heartland asserts that the information sought by respondent juan torres through deposition questions posed to heartlands corporate representative is privileged workproduct and that torres made no showing of need and undue hardship necessary to compel disclosure of such workproduct we grant the petition in part and quash the order with respect to questions    and  we deny certiorari relief without further discussion with respect to questions      and facts and procedural historytorres sued heartland in a negligence action arising from a traffic accident torres filed a notice of taking deposition duces tecum of heartlands corporate representative seeking certain information relating to the accident at the deposition torres attorney asked the risk manager who heartland had designated as its corporate representative the following questions was a final determination made that the accident was preventable․ if mr jones applied for jobs at another company as a driver and that company contacted your company would you feel obligated to report to the hiring company that mr jones had been in a preventable accident․ okay and did you make the determination one way or the other preventable or not preventable before litigation commenced․ was the amount of time he traveled from the time he recognized the vehicle traveling slow to the time of impact unclear to you at the time you completed your investigation into the accidentcounsel for heartland objected to each question and instructed the witness not to answer torres moved to compel discovery and heartland moved for a protective orderthe trial court granted torres motion to compel the trial court ruled that heartland had asserted no legally cognizable justification for privilege with respect to questions  and  for questions  and  the trial court ruled that the information sought by torres was not privileged and that the case law cited by heartland supported only the proposition that claims files themselves were workproduct the trial court also ruled that “nowhere in the florida rules of civil procedure is there a provision that states that an attorney may instruct a witness not to answer a question” heartland seeks review of the trial courts orderanalysisto obtain certiorari review of a trial courts order the petitioner must demonstrate that the order is a departure “from the essential requirements of law thereby causing irreparable injury which cannot be remedied on appeal following final judgment” avante villa at jacksonville beach inc v breidart  sod   fla st dca  an order erroneously compelling discovery of privileged information is reviewable by certiorari because an order requiring disclosure of privileged information may cause irreparable injury id see also allstate ins co v langston  sod  fla holding discovery of material protected by privilege or work product may cause irreparable injury because the erroneous discovery is deemed “catoutofthebag” in natureheartland asserts that the trial courts order compelling disclosure of information regarding its risk managers investigation departed from the essential requirements of law by requiring disclosure of workproduct which disclosure may cause irreparable injury to heartland we agreethe workproduct doctrine protects both fact workproduct information which relates to the case and is gathered in anticipation of litigation as well as opinion workproduct the attorneys mental impressions conclusions opinions and theories concerning litigation see acevedo v doctors hosp inc  sod  fla d dca  where information qualifies for protection as fact workproduct a party seeking discovery may obtain disclosure of such information only upon a showing of need and undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials through other means see fla r civ p binformation received by attorneys prepared in anticipation of trial by investigators or nonattorneys has been determined to qualify for workproduct protection southern bell tel  tel co v deason  sod   fla workproduct protection also extends to information gathered in an investigation conducted in anticipation of litigation by corporate nonattorney employees including employees of a corporations risk management department see eg metric engineering inc v small  sod   fla st dca  florida east coast railway ll c v jones  sod   fla st dca  royal caribbean cruises ltd v doe  sod   fla rd dca  holding that incident reports filled out by employees and filed with the risk management department to be used to defend against potential litigation are protected as workproduct see also orange park christian academy v russell  sod  fla st dca  holding that a principals notes and memoranda regarding an accident at the school prepared in anticipation of litigation were workproduct it is not necessary that a lawsuit be filed for information gathered in an accident investigation to qualify for workproduct protection see royal caribbean cruises ltd  sod at  district bd of trustees of miami–dade community college v chao  sod   fla d dca  holding that even if a specific claim has not been filed sending documents to a risk management department anticipates litigationhere torres sought discovery of information concerning heartlands risk management investigation through the deposition of heartlands risk manager because the risk management investigation was conducted in anticipation of litigation information relating to the investigation qualifies for workproduct protection questions    and  sought information gathered in the course of the risk managers investigation of the accident questions   and  sought information related to the preventability of the accident which is information that heartland could have obtained only through its risk management investigation question  requested that the risk manager disclose whether his investigation of the accident revealed the speed at which heartlands driver was traveling at the time of the accident because the information sought by torres would require heartland to disclose information gathered in the course of the investigation by its risk manager and because torres made no showing of need or undue hardship the trial courts order compelling disclosure was a departure from the essential requirements of law see avante villa  sod at  we therefore grant the petition for certiorari with regard to questions    and  and quash the order with regard to questions    and denied in part granted in partfootnotes  the trial court also erred in ruling that the florida rules of civil procedure prohibit counsel from instructing a deponent not to answer a question florida rule of civil procedure c specifically provides for such an instruction in certain circumstances “a party may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege” see eg
