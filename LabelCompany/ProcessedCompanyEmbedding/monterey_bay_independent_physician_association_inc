other organization health care providers that are legal entities the parents here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for npis if so directed by their parents  the psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital the parent which is a legal entity the legal entity must obtain an npi the psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own npi if the hospital determines that it should  a group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations but each office is not a separate legal entity instead each office is part of the corporation the parent which is a legal entity the offices are examples of subparts
