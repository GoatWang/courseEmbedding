and invest accordingly i need a plan to meet my financial goals if you are like many americans your emotions ride along with the extreme cycles of the market traditional diversification and asset allocation may fall short in today’s increasingly globalized and volatile marketplace leaving many investors overexposed to the potentially devastating impact these dramatic market shifts can bring at beacon we believe the greatest risk to investors is severe market volatility often resulting in doubledigit losses because losses can be more impactful than gains requiring a hundred percent increase to recoup from a  percent loss for example the average investor may not have the time to wait to get back where they started   the overwhelming response from investors today has been a need for safety and consistency in their investment approach without giving up all hope for competitive returns   this is where we come in beacon capital management believes it has created a distinctive philosophy designed to meet your unique and complex needs today based on three fundamentals         maximize diversification through equal sector allocation         minimize losses with mechanical investments         maintain discipline to protect from emotionled decision making    click here to read more about our investment philosophies we believe that understanding your risk comfort level is the first step in investing  and recognizing that your risk comfort level can vary over time is important to consider too  a cautious investor may value asset preservation more than beating the market while an aggressive investor may aspire to achieve higher than average returns by undertaking more exposure to risk  at beacon we do not believe that risk is the only road to return your comfort level in exposure to market volatility is a major consideration when determining the investment approach that will work best for you   to get started on identifying which investment strategy that might work best for you over the long haul please take a moment to complete our risk tolerance survey investing is one part of a financial plan  a comprehensive financial plan may also include things like asset preservation income withdrawal tax preservation estate planning and more beacon capital management has a nationwide network of affiliated advisors who can assist you with implementing your beacon
