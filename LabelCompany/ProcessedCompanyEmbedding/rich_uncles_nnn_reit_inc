uncles reviewed by ruth lyons published on july   last modified july   editor rating rated  stars rich uncles is a public nontraded real estate investment trust reit you dont need to be accredited to invest the tenants are screened and you can get in with a low minimum investment however this is a longterm investment which might not please traders who want quick returns or exit using a crowdfunding platform to raise capital is a popular new concept in real estate investing including real estate investment trusts reits crowdfunding makes property funding easier and faster than going through the traditional routes of finding bank financing or investors with large amounts of capital who are interested in specific opportunities it also opens up real estate investing to people who have only small amounts of money to invest rich uncles’ business model allows everyone the opportunity to own commercial real estate through an investment in their nnn reit what is rich uncles rich uncles provides an online platform for investors to buy shares of their singletenant commercial property reit called the rich uncles nnn reit the reit is invested in property leased by retail businesses such as gas stations drugstores and grocery stores that pay monthly rent the collected rent is distributed to shareholders monthly as dividend income rich uncles’ platform provides photos and details about the properties in the reit while you don’t pick specific properties to invest in — there’s one reit that holds these properties and you invest in the reit itself — you can get a good feel for the portfolio holdings by reviewing the details of the individual properties online rich uncles’ portfolio rich uncles acquires and holds commercial properties that meet specific criteria to reduce risk and provide reliable rental income specifically they seek singletenant properties located in primary secondary and certain tertiary markets where construction is substantially complete to reduce risk associated with new construction leased on a “triple net” basis where the tenant is responsible for the payment of taxes insurance and maintenance leased to tenants with strong financial statements including investmentgrade credit quality and subject to longterm leases with defined rental rate increases according to cofounder howard makler rich uncles gives small investors the opportunity to “invest alongside the chairman of the world’s largest commercial real estate company and a handpicked team of experts that know the world of real estate inside and out” rich uncles’ founding investor is raymond wirta former chairman of cbre nysecbg a global real estate services firm rounding out the management team is ceo harold hofer a lawyer who has participated in real estate transactions as a principal and as a broker valued in excess of  billion in his year real estate to understand rich uncles’ product offering it’s important to understand the difference between a traded reit and a public nontraded reit rich uncles being a public nontraded reit quick comparison  —read the reviewread the reviewrating rated  stars rated  stars rated  stars min depositfeesfreeyear  yearaccredited investornonono a real estate investment trust or reit is a corporation that takes capital from many different investors and uses it to buy incomeproducing real estate in general a reit is an entity that combines the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for real estate investments allows individual investors to invest in a professionally managed largescale diversified portfolio of real estate pays distributions to investors of at least  of its annual reit taxable income and avoids the “double taxation” treatment of investment income because a reit is not generally subject to federal corporate income taxes on the portion of income distributed to its stockholders shares in public reits are available to any investor through the stock market can be purchased from any registered investment broker and are considered to be liquid — the shares trade on the stock market exchanges and therefore can be bought and sold quickly there are hundreds of public reits on vanguard fidelity schwab and other brokerage houses from which you can choose rich uncles’ offering nnn reit inc is classified as a public nontraded reit the distinction is they are “public” to the extent they are registered with the sec so the public can view their offering but they do not trade on the open market as do the public reit shares you purchase from an investment broker typically the sponsor of a public nontraded reit has an inhouse dealermanager that is responsible for marketing shares to finralicensed brokerdealers and secregulated investment advisors which results in substantial fees these fees typically include  to  sales commissions paid to the brokerdealer for soliciting the investment  to  commission paid to the dealer managing the sales effort and  to  paid to the brokerdealer for costs associated with a due diligence review of the offering all these commissions and reimbursements mean approximately – of the cost of the typical nontraded reit is spent on brokerdealer and dealermanager costs leaving only – of investment dollars being placed into actual real estate rich uncles llc was founded for “a single purpose — to make real estate investment easier and less expensive for the small investor” instead of using the typical brokerdealer distribution channel and paying advisory intermediaries rich uncles uses crowdfunding and the internet to market their reit directly to investors rich uncles believes that with the ease and transparency of the internet the company can deliver a real estate product that has roughly  more of the investment amount actually being invested in real estate rather than being paid to others in the form of commissions and reimbursements rich uncles features minimum investment  fees none accredited investor no reits yes offering types equity property types commercial return — historically rich uncles has distributed a  annualized dividend on a monthly basis this is an increase from the  annualized dividend they offered when their nnn reit first launched in july  the hypothetical earnings found on their website assume you reinvest your dividends over five years rich uncles — possible earnings liquidity — rich uncles’ reit provides a share redemption program that can be accessed through your shareholder dashboard you have the option of selling back your shares to rich uncles this aspect of their offering was developed in order to meet the market’s demand for a real estate investment product that did not follow the ebb and flow of the traditional stock market but still provided a level of liquidity traditional commercial real estate can’t match in this sense rich uncles’ model adds liquidity to a previously illiquid product longterm investment — when you invest you are committing to being part owner of many commercial real estate properties real estate is a longterm investment when the fund reaches its cap of investor capital — typically – years — a fund liquidation event takes place and investment proceeds are distributed you get your value back — what your shares are worth at the time plus profits from the proceeds of the sale of all the buildings owned by the fund rich uncles is considered an “openended” fund meaning there is no set liquidation date it is up to the principals of rich uncles to determine the appropriate time and circumstances for portfolio liquidation rich uncles has their shares revalued by an independent third party appraisal firm on an annual basis which allows their investors the chance to benefit from increases in property value over time  cash equity ownership in all owned properties — rich uncles limits their mortgage debt by buying properties with  cash down payments which means they carry  cash equity ownership in their entire real estate portfolio dividend reinvestment option — you can choose to have your monthly dividends automatically reinvested and compound your ownership no broker commissions no investor fees — because rich uncles doesn’t use brokers they do not pay commissions instead choosing to use crowdfunding to find investors which reduces their overhead and increases the percentage of returns they can distribute to their members “triplenet leases” — rich uncles buys commercial properties where tenants are responsible for paying all propertyrelated expenses including taxes insurance and maintenance availability — rich uncles nnn reit is currently available to residents of ca co ct fl ga hi id il in ky la mt nh nv ny sd tx ut vt wi wy pros no reit expenses — typically publictraded reits pay subordinated performance fees equal to  of the amounts by which asset sale proceeds exceed the amounts paid to purchase shares and a return of their invested capital plus a  cumulative noncompounded annual return on invested capital rich uncles charges none of these customary fees they completely skip the middleman — and his commissions — by marketing directly to investors through their crowdfunding platform you make money or rich uncles doesn’t get paid — unlike your typical portfolio manager or broker who collects his monthly management fee or commissions whether he makes money for you or not rich uncles’ business model is performance based the first  of profits is paid out to shareholders — rich uncles makes money only if the investments deliver — and their share is  of profits once the investment exceeds the  hurdle truly passive real estate alternative — rich uncles reit is a truly passive real estate investment you invest in the reit and rich uncles does all the legwork and paperwork associated with owning leasing and managing commercial properties paying you cash dividends on a monthly basis no need to be accredited — you don’t need to be an accredited investor rich uncles asks only that you have a combined family income of k or a net worth of at least k suitability standards differ slightly from state to state but richunclescom walks investors through the requirements of their state of residence highquality tenants — rich uncles invests only in singletenant commercial properties with existing longterm leases they don’t buy vacant buildings and find tenants they don’t invest in distressed properties and rehab them they acquire only three types of properties — office retail and industrial — which are already leased to high quality tenants  equity reduces real estate mortgage risk — rich uncles only acquires properties with  equity that would be like you putting a  down payment when you buy your home geographical diversification reduces real estate exposure risk — rich uncles’ strategy is to acquire properties across the country thereby reducing the risks of any one market by diversifying their holdings geographically low minimum investment — the minimum investment of  opens it up to many more people than most commercial real estate crowdfunding platforms monthly dividends — like a dividendpaying stock rich uncles reit provides steady monthly dividend income under normal circumstances you can choose to receive your dividends in cash or reinvest them cons investment liquidity — once you make an investment you are pretty much committed to the investment for the term there is currently no secondary market to sell your investment to others longterm investment — while some investors have turned to nontraded reits to sidestep stock market risk it’s important to understand you give up some liquidity at the same time real estate is longerterm investment you don’t really know what your shares are worth until the very end when the property sells or rich uncles conducts its annual asset appraisal and adjusts share value accordingly monthly dividends are not guaranteed — this can be said of any dividend really there are no guarantees when it comes to investing and that includes the monthly payouts from rich uncles rich uncles’  equity model greatly diminishes the chance of foreclosure on any of their holdings and their tenant screening process ensures credit worthiness but there is still a chance tenants will fail to pay their rent which would mean there is no rental income to distribute their website requires an account even to “learn more” — when you click on their links of “learn more” or “how it works” you are given the option to create a login if you don’t want to create a login you don’t get to see more about the company summary rich uncles’ reit investing strategy is to buy commercial real estate with at least  cash down rent the spaces to reliable companies with longterm leases and pay out the rental income to their reit shareholders via monthly dividends similar to fundrise which we reviewed a few months ago rich uncles reits give investors access to real estate deals without the high dollar commitment typically needed without being an accredited investor and without paying the high frontend load fees typically charged by reits rich uncles’ business model is an investor’s dream in the sense that unlike brokers who get paid commission whether they make you money or not rich uncles is incentivized to make money for you the company is entitled to profits only after the reit delivers a return of  to shareholders purchasing shares of rich uncles nnn reit inc involves some risk including the fact that rich uncles is a new company with a limited track

performance crosses over the return threshold you may have confused the ‘no commission’ charged by outside bds with the performance fee that is being charged one has nothing to do with the other the

make money online legitimate work at home jobs real online survey companies write a review rich uncle’s reviews – legit or scam   richunclescom from  reviews review it   rich uncle’s found online at richunclescom is a company who says their goal is to create a platform that makes real estate investment accessible for everyone who wants to get involved traditionally speaking real estate investment was thought to only be available to people who had large sums of investment capital that they could translate into large stakes in investment opportunities rich uncle’s has a goal of making this type of investment available to people with different levels of capital available so this type of investment opportunity is no longer off limits to the general public how does it work the whole concept of rich uncle’s rests on something called a real estate investment trust or reit which is a corporation that takes capital from many different investors and uses it to buy and then operate income producing real estate in addition reits are exempt from taxes if certain standards can be met including the distribution of at least  of the taxable income reits make this possible by generating and distributing this income to their shareholders in dividends finally this company does not pay commissions instead choosing to use the internet for advertising and finding investors which reduces their overhead and increases the percentage of returns they distribute to their members is this a legitimate opportunity this company is funding real estate investment opportunities through a specific type of a crowdfunding platform they say that their potential investors can begin purchasing ownership in reits with investments of just  using the crowdfunding platform to raise capital for real estate opportunities is becoming a popular new concept in real estate investing it not only opens up real estate investing to people who only have small amounts of money to invest but it is beneficial for the properties and owners themselves crowdfunding often allows these properties to be funded easier and faster than going through the traditional routes of finding bank funding or investors with large amounts of capital who are interested in the opportunity so this type of real estate investment is growing in acceptability and popularity and people who are interested in it can look at the opportunities available through rich uncle’s or other companies that take a similar approach if youre at reviewopediacom because you are looking for a way to make money online then check out our

many computer glitches it’s rediculous my sales person sidesteps questions and if you look at their audited financials you will see they are not making much money certainly not  perhaps it’s because

auditors ernst  young since inception a further technical response regarding understand your  is listed below the form div that you received from rich uncles nnn reit showed both “total ordinary dividends” and “nondividend distributions” this is primarily due to property depreciation deductions current tax codes allow real estate owners to depreciate or write off the costs of a property’s improvements ie the bricks and mortar but not underlying ground over a certain time frame this is effectively a paper loss and is one of the benefits of owning commercial real estate nnn reit’s business model is to acquire properties in advance of selling reit shares using the reit’s acquisition line of credit as reit shares are sold the line of credit is correspondingly reduced we use this strategy to ensure that the proceeds from reit shares sold are immediately deployed into dividend yieldgenerating real estate ownership and not deposited into an escrow account until enough shares are sold to purchase the next property nnn reit purchased its first properties in june of last year utilizing the reit’s line of credit depreciation deductions began to accrue then prior to selling any reit shares the line of credit was also employed to purchase our dollar general portfolio in november and our dana inc acquisition in december the line of credit balance was reduced to  last week repaid from the proceeds of reit shares sold but we are about to dip into the line again to purchase our next asset a consequence of our buyfirst sell reit sharesnext strategy is that the reit built up depreciation deductions in  that fully “tax sheltered” the dividends that were paid to shareholders these depreciation deductions have reduced your tax or “cost” basis in your reit shares investment and under current irs codes you will be taxed at capital gains rates on the difference between your ultimate sales price of your reit shares and your cost basis we trust that this clarifies any misunderstanding that you may have had it is important to note that no reit share offering proceeds were used to pay dividends all dividend were paid from property rental receipts replyget me out

“ponzi scheme” not dummies like you you should know that people who use fasttalking announcers disclaimers etc who flood the am airwaves are a legitimate class act and you should not worry about your

savvy investors only harold hofer saysoctober th  at  pmi am rich uncles’ ceo just to the extent that it is not otherwise obvious whomever is posting on this site as “rich uncles” is not affiliated

reviews i invested  then i went and did some research of my own and have found that sure enough it is not a dividend the reviews are correct it is a “return of capital ” which is legal but it’s very deceptive this company is set up to make the founders money not the shareholders the return of capital will lower your bases which in turn will cost you money find a publicly traded reit don’t invest

this company will be out of business at some point reply johnny rocket says october st  at  am stay away if their offering was a good deal it would have been snapped up by institutional investors and how can they “guarantee” a  return in a  world and you need to think about why anyone would risk their money buying real estate from a radio commercial or website also it takes up to three months or longer to have your money returned if you decide to sell and they are not a public reit regardless of what they tell you they are “public” to the extent they are registered with the sec so the public can view their offering but they do not trade on the open market such as any legitimate reit would…xlre and many others if you are a novice investor i suggest you contact a certified financial planner cfp who is also a fiduciary which means they are in business to serve you and not their best interests they can review this with you and i am certain they will tell you essentially what i have written you must complete your due diligence before making any decision like this good luck replydouglas j lewis cfp saysoctober th  at  pmyou are correct the nontraded reits are public but not traded on stock exchanges there are private reits also which are not traded on stock exchanges the fact that this one is public tells you the reporting to the sec is required as far as safety the public reits are safer than the private reits however there is another risk in the traded public reits that the nontraded ones avoid this is the daily potential drop in the value of your investment the value of your nontraded reit is not subject to marketability also do not confuse the income your monthly distribution from your reit with your return you should be interested in knowing how much is your monthly income going to be although not guaranteed how long your income period will be how many years and when will there be a liquidity event this liquidity event is the most crucial during the operational period of your reit you are receiving a percentage return on your investment then at liquidity you will find out what percentage receive of your investment if you receive  return upon liquidity this turned out to be a good investment there are some excellent nontraded reits and some lousy ones the prospectus is the best way to understand the risks as a certified financial planner i always begin my due diligence here then i go a lot further utilizing other due diligence attorney firms to get their written evaluations so far the biggest risk i see with this risk is the lack of any information on a liquidity event other risks i have found are with regard to the sponsors mark says september th  at  pm was planning to move some money here from a few bank accounts earning nothing

financial spdr fund and they recently spun off the real estate portion to the xlre exchange traded fund i sold the xlre because i think real estate has seen its best days this cycle my point is that i received xlre yesterday sold it today with a charge pf  and will receive all my funds by tuesday of next week there are several posters below who state it takes up to three months to receive funds from rich uncles when you decide to sell why would anyone invest here when you can do so in a publically traded reit and do it on line in a millisecond and i knew exactly what my sale price was at the instant i sold the fund shares that is something you cannot find out at ru regardless of how often you ask nor will they inform you of the value of your ru shares while you own them and remember as a private reit rich uncles is not under the same rules and regulations as a public reit which means you have no protections no governmental over site or review to ensure they act as a fiduciary and in your best interest stay away from this operation and only invest in a public reit otherwise you are risking you money be careful replywhat the what saysseptember rd  at  pmthey are a public reit look

disbursements should be rolled back into the fund and reinvested am sure this is happening but transparency is critical for newlessknownnonpublic entities  you should disclose to investors ongoing cash flow analyses on each property held  i see more petro secondary market locations and noncredit tenants in the trackrecord portfolio than i am initially comfortable with seems like more dd on your purchase advisors’ part could produce less risk as quality nnn properties are out there…you just have to work harder to find them understand the need to get money out and working but at what cost riskwise  i do not like the radio ads on potus m smerconish’s morning show is only one i have heard as it diminishes in my mind the brand it sounds too much like used car dealership quality…”meet my dog spot” especially the unbelievably fast disclosures at the end of the commercial i get the need to capitalize on time purchased but it enhances suspicions in my mind of rus creditability  finally…i have been involved in re finance  banking in the oc for over years and can assure you that ray wirta has a stellar reputation in the industry is legitimate force and is one of the primary reasons

exchange and thus you should understand that any investment in our reit is generally illiquid early redemption of your shares may be possible each month through a rich uncles program but are subject to limitations and fees discussed in the offering documents including the prospectus or offering circular as these reits are not publicly traded on any securities exchange many factors affect the valuation of nontraded reits including the portfolio of real estate assets owned strength of the balance sheet overhead expenses and cost of capital the payment of any dividends or distributions and

if this is such a great deal why are the negatives so numerous the answer is that this is not a low risk enterprise there are no legal protections for you there is no governmental oversight or review to ensure adherence to industry and fiduciary standards in addition as one commenter stated it took three months to sell his investment and receive the funds if you invest do so with a public reit which ru is not despite the owners comments you can buy a public reit on monday decide its not for you and sell on tuesday and have the funds in your account by friday or early the following week since ru is a non traded reit you must go through them to find a buyer and who knows how long that could take and you do not know at any given time the value of your shares since this is a private business and not subject to the same rules as a pullic reit you must be certain you fully understand exactly what the risks are and decide if they justify lending them your money and remember a public reit is traded in the public stock market just like any other stock and ru is not traded that alone is a giant red flag that something is very wrong here caveat emptor replyuchgo mba yale jd saysaugust th  at  amnever never is correct the reason real estate is such a good investment is because of a very large noncash deduction — depreciation — that serves to reduce the taxable income from the rents in other words real estate has two types of income broadly speaking taxable income — the rents and similar cash flows in excess of deductions — and nontaxable cashflow — from depreciation the investors are only paid out of the taxable income which may be a quite small portion of total cashflow the promoters keep the rest potentially depending on how much cash the offering receives the promoters may buy real estate for  cash all from the investors but receive nearly all of the cashflow another twist on that approach would be for the promoters to take a mortgage on the already purchased real estate and pay those cash proceeds to themselves none would be required to be paid to the investors because mortgage proceeds are not taxable income as never never points out owning a nonpublic reit is kind of like owning a timeshare at a resort you might not be able to sell it rating    stay away says august th  at  pm the president says there are no sales people but the “costumer service people” call over and over asking you to invest i also think it is in bad taste that any employee especially the president would be posting reviews replyrich uncles saysseptember th  at  pmthese calls are made for your benefit perhaps you’ve forgotten to up your investment and miss out of the huge dividends we are currently paying what if you missed out on that you would kick yourself later the more you invest the more you will make it’s that simple we would be remiss if we did not remind you of this rating    skeptical says august th  at  pm if it sounds to good to be true…run away when i look at the prospectus i expect to see a wealth of financial data looking at ru’s that data is scarce and it is bloated with cautions and warnings the main thing of course is that there are no protections for the investor no thanks reply rating    look says august th  at  am the research is easy ask for a copy of the audited financials that they submit to the department of business oversight and you will see that richuncles is not profitable also look at all the prospectus and all fee’s they charge if you do you will run the other way also they were paying  free share for s positive review on their website reply rich uncles says august th  at  pm real people real investors greg hurst human resource manager “very easy to get started i received a phone call to ensure that my experience was positive” robert probert pastor “i really like the idea that my bank is now paying me more to invest than it is to save” justin gutierrez inside sales representative “i love the idea

reply rating    terry says august th  at  pm if you are looking into investing into reits there are some very large companies traded on the us stock exchanges that pay large dividends on a regular basis i own several myself – agnc cys rso wmc but this is more risky and my rso has under performed the general reit market a good alternative is an etf that includes reits like – fty rem mort  kbwd which also pay good dividends on a regular basis replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmif you research any all listed reits over a month period you will find volatility of  up or down depending on the year during that same period if you research the reits income called ffo – funds from operation it is likely stable so why the volatility because publicly traded reits behaves like stocks which defeats the purpose of diversifying into an investment that acts characteristically different rich uncles reit alternatively revalues shares once a year based on net asset value which is essentially an appraised value of the real estate holdings cash dividends are paid monthly along with liquidity allowing people to sell back to company at share price some limitations apply – but overall – we

am as an investor i’ve had many problems first of all they call me and bug me to add more money to my account way to much after i’ve sent an investment they have misplaced it and i’ve had to make numerous calls to have them find my check then when i did an ach they didn’t see it on my account and they had to “sync” my account befor it was credited i’m really almost to my breaking point they have way to many accounting glitches and their sales people are way to aggressive also when i looked at my  from last year there was no income and yes all divideds have been return of capital replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmjoe we did upgrade our accounting system and did indeed experience some issues with ‘syncing’ the data as you stated we also devoted necessary resources to insure that all accounts were properly adjusted and all errors promptly corrected we have absolutely no salespeople or anybody who earns commissions whatsoever our investor relations staff have no incentive for you to invest or not regarding “return of capital” relative to your  – that is a tax statement – and does not suggest your dividend was paid with proceeds other than rental income or profit from sale of real properties rating    mike says august th  at  am why would you risk your money on an unproven company that is not publicly traded and the president of the company is arguing about people’s opinions on reviews it’s ludicrous it’s only  people read the prospectus they charge fees for everything the hidden fee will kill you read the prospectus replybrad saysaugust st  at  amthere not their rich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmunproven we have been around for for years now their are no hidden fees as everything is outlined in the prospectus the fees we charge for asset management and acquisition are frankly not a profit center but rather a reimbursement for actual staff costs and business operation google ray wirta having the opportunity to invest alongside him is anything but ludicrous do your research rating    ben says august th  at  am they seem to be doing a lot of advertising that is not cheap when you call it all seems like a sales pitch to me and it’s to much risk for  interest they are such a small fund there is no way that the company is profitable yet and they have been in business over  years also i think it is in bad tast that the president of the company is posting numerous reviews replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmour expense reimbursement is strictly limited to  one time any other losses are borne by the llc owners not the reit investors the president is taking the time to respond as this site is mostly comprised of noninvestors passing dishonest information it is appropriate to point out we have  registered complaints with the bbb and have hundreds of satisfied investors all of which can be confirmed here httprichunclescomstoriesbextraorgdbextraorgd rating    jake says august th  at  pm i recently had one of my clients ask me my opinion on this investment when i looked at the  my client paid no taxes because there was no income when i look at the dividend it is not a dividend is a return of capital i further looked at the financials and the financials look like they are losing money then i just decided to do simple math i called a friend at clear channel worldwide and they said that before they went to national they were spending about  per month on advertising that’s about   million dollars per year then you add that they have about  employees that’s probably a cost of  million including insurance bonuses time off and special events then from what i understand they have some pretty fancy offices when i look at the location and the square footage of the two offices that they have there probably spending about another million dollars a year minimum on offices these are probably all lowballing the costs are probably much more than this but when i add that all up plus the fact that they’re saying theyre giving a   dividend but they have about  million under management that they have raised over a fouryear period i don’t see sustainability of this company i don’t think that we can really call this a ponzi scheme but it seems like to me there is a mismanagement of money perhaps when they reach about a  million mark or even a  million mark of properties under management they will be profitable but at this point i do not think it’s a very good investment replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmthe reits themselves have always been profitable enough to cover all dividend payments from rental income received and profit from real property sales never have we paid a dividend from return of capital keep in mind we are real estate experts… if you knew the terms of our office space lease you would be impressed offices were built for very little money and our entire operation is very frugal advertising costs are not the responsibility of reit property owners as they are protected by a  cap on all expense contributions instead of paying a  commission we charge  instead of paying a  expense contribution we charge  very fair indeed rating    joe says august th  at  pm full disclosure i have not yet invested but am currently researching this as a way to diversify my investments in k roth ira stock brokerage account  plan and home equity the research i have done i am a finance professional with a degree in finance and an mba is all positive thus far this is a legit opportunity with the same risks as any other investment…what you need to determine is whether or not the risk is worth the potential return of  i must say that the negative reviews on this site seem to be coming from uneducated people who blindly invested or know little about reits andor public exchanges this reit is subject to sec regulation but is done so under relatively new laws pertaining to crowdfunding in other words the sec wanted individuals to be able to invest in opportunities without having to go through institutional investors or brokerage firms this is a good thing for the individual it doesn’t make it a ponzi scheme the sec is in fact regulating this reit which doesn’t eliminate risk but does ensure it is not a “scam” to the point about risk your risk here is that the economy tanks or the commercial real estate market crashes unlikely but more realistic given recent history the value of the properties in the reit would decline your share value would decline and the company may not be able to repurchase your shares if you wanted to “cash out” you have these same exact risks when investing in the stock market if you put  in a dow jones index fund in  and wanted to cash out in  you would only get back  of what you put in and you wouldn’t have received a dividend if you bought citigroup stock in    it was worth less than a dollar in  stock prices even for safe companies go up and down based on nothing but market speculation at least the value of this reit is tied to real property the only added risk of this reit is that the market for share repurchase is completely with the fund they don’t have to buy back your shares but if they don’t their fund would fail last comment anyone who would blindly dump k or any amount into anything without testing it first is not worthy of providing their opinion start with  see how it returns then build it up slowly if you are happy get rich quick doesn’t align with safe investment replymrmatteroffact saysaugust th  at  pmif you have to say “this isn’t a get rich quick scheme” it’s a get rich quick scheme rich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmwe love sophisticated investors google ray wirta – this is your new real estate partner this isn’t a get rich quick scheme but is a prudent way to own a portfolio of income

by the sec and is totally liquid  replybill tea saysdecember th  at  amlet’s be sure we’re distinguishing between equity reits and mortgauge reits big difference and yes big volatility based on many factors especially projected interest rates for mreits for that volatility you are richly rewarded with yield again mreits of  and if you have a long time window as you should with ru you’ll probably be ok based on that i’m unsure as to what advantage this give except that its equity based and is much more than the typical equity reit yield of  rich uncles saysaugust th  at  amgood question we are also regulated by the sec but have elected not to be traded on a stock exchange – for good reason if you research any all listed reits over a month period you will find volatility of  up or down

these guys real deal” douglas hanchar associate at barnes law llp “as a real estate attorney i have seen very few investment vehicles as well organized and thought out as richuncles they have an ideal

it it will take long to get your money back and the return will be minimal very minimal honestly a waste replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmthe return would be  annually and you can reinvest your

over the financials and it is true that rich uncles has never made a profit the money they are paying out is “return of capital” not a divided it definitely is a ponzi scheme at least for now the

exchange as far as the renters go they seem by and large to be companies that seldom fail even when business is slow i do find it a bit strange that a company whose portfolio speaks to its strength is defending itself in online reviews most people who do reviews online either have nothing to do with the company or have built a minor annoyance into a major catastrophe due diligence should not be built on online reviews replyrich uncles saysaugust th  at  pmas stated before tell your account to review our consolidated statement of cash flows this shows a positive number that demonstrates how
