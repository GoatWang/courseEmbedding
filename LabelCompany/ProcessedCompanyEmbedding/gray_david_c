radio programs played a role in collecting signatures to force a recall election california electricity crisisedit main article california electricity crisis soon after taking office davis was able to fasttrack the first power plant construction in twelve years in april  although the plant did not come on line before the electricity crisis according to the subsequent federal energy regulatory commissions investigation and report numerous energy trading companies many based in texas such as enron corporation illegally restricted their supply to the point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts rolling blackouts affecting  customers hit the san francisco bay area on june   and san diego gas  electric company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in august  on december   suffering from low supply and idled power plants the california independent system operator caiso which manages the california power grid declared the first statewide stage  power alert meaning power reserves were below  percent rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity windmill field outside palm springs hot temperatures were thought to be pushing california to rolling blackouts though it was later discovered that market manipulation was the cause on january   davis declared a state of emergency in response to the electricity crisis speculators led by enron corporation were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks and finally suffered rolling blackouts on january  and  davis stepped in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market since the california power companies were technically bankrupt and had no buying power california agreed to pay  billion for power over the next  years newspaper publishers sued davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal during the electricity crisis the davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption these efforts the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a  reduction in electricity usage from june  to june  gray davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that davis did all he could some critics on the left such as arianna huffington alleged that davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers some of davis energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis in addition the democraticcontrolled legislature would sometimes push davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities some conservatives argued that davis signed overpriced energy contracts employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in san diego which they argue could have given davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation the electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to davis recall davis giving a speech on energy in a speech at ucla on august   davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis but then forcefully attacked the houstonbased energy suppliers i inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers we got no help from the federal government in fact when i was fighting enron and the other energy companies these same companies were sitting down with vice president cheney to draft a national energy strategy when the enron verdicts were rendered years later convicting enron and other companies of market manipulation davis responded with the following quote “ ken lay and jeffrey skilling more than anyone are the reason im talking to you now from this law firm ” on november   shortly before leaving office davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on january   the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants during that time california issued licenses to  new power plants amounting to  megawatts of electricity production when completed in  the los angeles times published an article that credited davis signing of the long term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing california a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy in march  the federal energy regulatory commissions longawaited report on the socalled energy crisis was released that report mostly vindicated davis laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of californias treasury on some  energy trading companies most of which were based in texas budget crisisedit during the economic boom years of the davis administration the california budget expanded to cover davis new programs californias low national k education rankings and davis campaign pledge to help education along with the large majority that elected davis to his first term and his early popularity suggest that a majority of californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when california was in budget surplus polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the california voters under the davis administration taxes were cut by over  billion that included a  billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees the cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a  law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed  percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in  and  davis also vetoed  billion in appropriations during that span davis signing the  state budget the  and  budgets would prove much more difficult to balance with a dramatic drop in state revenue while californias economy was expanding california was producing record budget surpluses under davis even after his tax cuts and new spending according to the california department of finance california had a  surplus at the end of  and california was projected to have a  surplus at the end fiscal year  these surplus monies were left in the treasury davis claimed to be cautious with state finances “ i’m trying to chart a prudent course and keep us somewhere in the middle i don’t want to jump the gun on spending i don’t want to jump the gun on tax relief said davis concerning the budget surpluses on october   ” then the dotcom boom that had been fueling californias record tax revenues burst unexpectedly because of the large number of high tech firms in california and californias dependence on state income taxes when the dotcom boom turned to bust state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the states credit rating became unpopular the beginning shortfall for the  state budget was  billion davis announced that the  budget shortfall would be  billion while the

studies claimed that davis fundraising skills were second to none in the political arena while senator john mccain called davis  goal of  million disgraceful one article in the san francisco chronicle

years of his governorship now arnoldwatchorg a project of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both democrats and republicans called davis a pay to play politician and a sellout during the  election campaign davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the republican primaries against los angeles mayor richard riordan davis claimed that riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record polls showed that as a moderate riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate polls even showed that riordan would defeat davis davis attacked riordian with negative ads in the primary the ads questioned riordans prochoice stance by questioning riordans support of prolife politicians and judges the ads pointed out riordans position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of gray davis who strongly supported it daviss negative ads against riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the  election page led to riordans defeat in the republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate bill simon in the first  weeks of  davis spent  million on ads  million on positive ads boasting of his record  million on negative ads against riordan davis was reelected in the november  general election following a long and bitter campaign against simon marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished simons reputation davis campaign touted californias improving test scores environmental protection health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors davis campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted simons financial fraud scandal the  gubernatorial race was the most expensive in california state history with over  million spent davis campaign was better financed davis had over  million in campaign reserves more than simon in august  davis gained reelection with  of the vote to simons  however the simondavis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall davis won the election but the majority of voters disliked davis and did not approve of his job performance other challengesedit while polls attributed davis declining popularity to the energy and budget problems some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal davis a moderate had some disagreements with the more liberal democraticcontrolled legislature democrat john l burton the leader of the california state senate was davis chief antagonist in  republican leader jim brulte told the los angeles times that davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times i never felt i got to know him  i always felt a little sorry for him davis moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the democratic party during the recall davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal democratic base he had the reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them davis leadership and compromisebuilding skills have also been questioned many of the challenges that california faced during his years required a strong force of personality to forge compromise but davis lacked such skill he was also hurt by redistricting in  that made most districts safe for the incumbent party limiting some legislators need and willingness to compromise when davis was inaugurated he said regarding proposition  im a governor not a judge and vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state even the ones with which he personally disagreed davis defended the law initially but when it was declared unconstitutional ninth circuit court of appeals he did not appeal the decision davis personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic his personality forced him to depend more on political skills such as fundraising to win elections davis tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service as davis left office in  the san francisco chronicle published an editorial discussing his legacy the newspaper claimed that he lacked vision allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a robotic governing style that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships the chronicle commented that davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing davis never showed emotion to the voters he spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision second termedit davis signs ab  on september   establishing a

insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people he vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college many of davis opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from hispanics labor union members and liberal democrats ultimately davis did not have as much support from hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his  reelection

buying power california agreed to pay  billion for power over the next  years newspaper publishers sued davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal during the electricity crisis the davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption these efforts the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a  reduction in electricity usage from june  to june  gray davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that davis did all he could some critics on the left such as arianna huffington alleged that davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers some of davis energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis in addition the democraticcontrolled legislature would sometimes push davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities some conservatives argued that davis signed overpriced energy contracts employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in san diego which they argue could have given davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation the electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to davis recall davis giving a speech on energy in a speech at ucla on august   davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis but then forcefully attacked the houstonbased energy suppliers i inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers we got no help from the federal government in fact when i was fighting enron and the other energy companies these same companies were sitting down with vice president cheney to draft a national energy strategy when the enron verdicts were rendered years later convicting enron and other companies of market manipulation davis responded with the following quote “ ken lay and jeffrey skilling more than anyone are the reason im talking to you now from this law firm ” on november   shortly before leaving office davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on january   the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants during that time california issued licenses to  new power plants amounting to  megawatts of electricity production when completed in  the los angeles times published an article that credited davis signing of the long term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing california a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy in march  the federal energy regulatory commissions longawaited report on the socalled energy crisis was released that report mostly vindicated davis laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of californias treasury on some  energy trading companies most of which were based in texas budget crisisedit during the economic boom years of the davis administration the california budget expanded to cover davis new programs californias low national k education rankings and davis campaign pledge to help education along with the large majority that elected davis to his first term and his early popularity suggest that a majority of californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when california was in budget surplus polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the california voters under the davis administration taxes were cut by over  billion that included a  billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees the cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a  law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed  percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in  and  davis also vetoed  billion in appropriations during that span davis signing the  state budget the  and  budgets would prove much more difficult to balance with a dramatic drop in state revenue while californias economy was expanding california was producing record budget surpluses under davis even after his tax cuts and new spending according to the california department of finance california had a  surplus at the end of  and california was projected to have a  surplus at the end fiscal year  these surplus monies were left in the treasury davis claimed to be cautious with state finances “ i’m trying to chart a prudent course and keep us somewhere in the middle i don’t want to jump the gun on spending i don’t want to jump the gun on tax relief said davis concerning the budget surpluses on october   ” then the dotcom boom that had been fueling californias record tax revenues burst unexpectedly because of the large number of high tech firms in california and californias dependence on state income taxes when the dotcom boom turned to bust state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the states credit rating became unpopular the beginning shortfall for the  state budget was  billion davis announced that the  budget shortfall would be  billion while the legislative analyst projected a   reelectionedit main article california gubernatorial election  davis began fundraising for his  reelection campaign early in his governorship davis raised  million in  and  million in  both unprecedented sums at the time so early in an elected term davis  and  contributions included contributions from pacific gas  electric and edison international davis also received large contributions from labor groups environmental groups and individuals daviss fundraising efforts attracted much attention university of california berkeleys institute of government studies claimed that davis fundraising skills were second to none in the political arena while senator john mccain called davis  goal of  million disgraceful one article in the san francisco chronicle claimed that davis was raising  a day although davis fundraising pace was criticized by his many detractors arnold schwarzenegger would later collect contributions at a quicker rate during the early years of his governorship now arnoldwatchorg a project of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both democrats and republicans called davis a pay to play politician and a sellout during the  election campaign davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the republican primaries against los angeles mayor richard riordan davis claimed that riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record polls showed that as a moderate riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate polls even showed that riordan would defeat davis davis attacked riordian with negative ads in the primary the ads questioned riordans prochoice stance by questioning riordans support of prolife politicians and judges the ads pointed out riordans position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of gray davis who strongly supported it daviss negative ads against riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the  election page led to riordans defeat in the republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate bill simon in the first  weeks of  davis spent  million on ads  million on positive ads boasting of his record  million on negative ads against riordan davis was reelected in the november  general election following a long and bitter campaign against simon marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished simons reputation davis campaign touted californias improving test scores environmental protection health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors davis campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted simons financial fraud scandal the  gubernatorial race was the most expensive in california state history with over  million spent davis campaign was better financed davis had over  million in campaign reserves more than simon in august  davis gained reelection with  of the vote to simons  however the simondavis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall davis won the election but the majority of voters disliked davis and did not approve of his job performance other challengesedit while polls attributed davis declining popularity to the energy and budget problems some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal davis a moderate had some disagreements with the more liberal democraticcontrolled legislature democrat john l burton the leader of the california state senate was davis chief antagonist in  republican leader jim brulte told the los angeles times that davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times i never felt i got to know him  i always felt a little sorry for him davis moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the democratic party during the recall davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal democratic base he had the reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them davis leadership and compromisebuilding skills have also been questioned many of the challenges that california faced during his years required a strong force of personality to forge compromise but davis lacked such skill he was also hurt by redistricting in  that made most districts safe for the incumbent party limiting some legislators need and willingness to compromise when davis was inaugurated he said regarding proposition  im a governor not a judge and vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state even the ones with which he personally disagreed davis defended the law initially but when it was declared unconstitutional ninth circuit court of appeals he did not appeal the decision davis personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic his personality forced him to depend more on political skills such as fundraising to win elections davis tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service as davis left office in  the san francisco chronicle published an editorial discussing his legacy the newspaper claimed that he lacked vision allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a robotic governing style that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships the chronicle commented that davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing davis never showed emotion to the voters he spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision second termedit davis signs ab  on september   establishing a student loan repayment program for members of the state military forces davis second term which lasted only ten months was dominated by the recall election davis signed into law several controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign including one granting drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people he vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college many of davis opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from hispanics labor union members and liberal democrats ultimately davis did not have as much support from hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his  reelection governorelect arnold schwarzenegger president george w bush and governor gray davis speak to firefighters on november   davis was governor during the southern california fires of  more commonly known as the cedar fire davis declared a state of emergency in los angeles county san bernardino county san diego county and ventura county in october  and deployed the national guard to help with disaster relief by midnovember the greater south los angeles area had been declared a disaster area this enabled federal funding to help repair flooding and weatherrelated damage including the destruction of thousands of acres of vegetation the cedar fire was the last major event during davis tenure as governor both davis and governorelect schwarzenegger worked to help with disaster relief schwarzenegger went to washington dc and met vice president dick cheney to lobby the federal government for more disaster relief funds recalledit main article california gubernatorial recall election  in july  a sufficient number of citizen signatures were collected for a recall election the initial drive for the recall was fueled by funds from the personal fortune of us rep darrell issa a republican who originally hoped to replace davis himself the  california recall special election was the goal of the dump davis campaign and constituted the first gubernatorial recall in californian history and only the second in us history early in the recall election davis called the recall election an “insult” to the eight million voters who had voted in the  gubernatorial election the davis campaign tried to run against the recall yesno vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him davis tried to depict the recall as a  million waste of money that could allow a candidate with a very small percentage of the vote to become governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative there are no primaries in a recall election davis tried to run “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for california and who had made improvements to education and healthcare early august polls showed that over  supported the recall in september  davis conceded that he had lost touch with the voters and he was trying to correct that with numerous townhall meetings poll numbers in september showed a  drop in the number of california voters who were planning to vote yes on the recall according to some analysts and campaign aides davis town hall meetings and conversations with voters were softening his image many political insiders remarked that davis had made several comebacks and that he should not be counted out of the race despite poll numbers that showed over  planning to vote yes on the recall headlines of gray davis defeat in uc berkeleys newspaper the daily californian the papers headlines read davis terminated a reference to one of then governorelect arnold scharzeneggers movie characters the terminator during the recall davis blamed some of the states problems on his predecessor pete wilson davis claimed that he would have rather raised taxes on the upper tax brackets instead of restoring vehicle registration fees and college student tuition davis called the recall a rightwing effort to rewrite history after losing the fall election last year in a major  minute campaign address that was broadcast statewide davis said the recall was a rightwing power grab by republicans and he blamed republicans in the legislature and in washington for many of the states problems while at the same time he tried to take some of the responsibility for the states problems “ its like the oakland raiders saying to tampa bay we know you beat us but we want to play the super bowl again said davis about the recall ” on october   davis was recalled with  of the votes in favor of the recall and republican arnold schwarzenegger was elected to replace him as governor the bay area and los angeles county were the only regions in california to vote no on the recall davis joined lynn frazier of north dakota who was ousted in  as the only governors in american history to be recalled on the night of the recall davis conceded defeat and thanked california for having elected him in  statewide elections davis mentioned what he defined as the accomplishments of his administration such as improvements in education environmental protection and health insurance for children davis said he would help schwarzenegger in the transition and he later urged his staff to do the same life after politicsedit after leaving public office davis appeared on several shows such as the tonight show with jay leno and the late show with david letterman as well as a cameo on the cbs sitcom yes dear in december  he announced that he was joining the law firm of loeb  loeb davis spends  of his workdays practicing corporate law as of counsel to loeb  loeb in century city a firm where all attorneys wear casual attire even davis american lawyer magazine called the firm one of the best places in the country for legal staff to work davis has done several media interviews about his legacy he appeared prominently in the documentary enron the smartest guys in the room the debate about his legacy and role in the energy woes that proved to be his downfall remains in a cnn interview on august   davis expressed that he feels complete vindication because of the revelation that enron manipulated the california energy market and because of schwarzeneggers thenlow approval ratings he also indicated that he had no interest in running for governor again although he had been urged to run by some democrats he was a guest lecturer at uclas school of public policy in  alongside former republican state

sentiment was expressed on talk radio the john and ken show in los angeles called davis gumby in response to his changing positions on issues while mr kabc and al rantel also in los angeles coined the

fasttrack the first power plant construction in twelve years in april  although the plant did not come on line before the electricity crisis according to the subsequent federal energy regulatory commissions investigation and report numerous energy trading companies many based in texas such as enron corporation illegally restricted their supply to the point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts rolling blackouts affecting  customers hit the san francisco bay area on june   and san diego gas  electric company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in august  on december   suffering from low supply and idled power plants the california independent system operator caiso which manages the california power grid declared the first statewide stage  power alert meaning power reserves were below  percent rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity windmill field outside palm springs hot temperatures were thought to be pushing california to rolling blackouts though it was later discovered that market manipulation was the cause on january   davis declared a state of emergency in response to the electricity crisis speculators led by enron corporation were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks and finally suffered rolling blackouts on january  and  davis stepped in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market since the california power companies were technically bankrupt and had no buying power california agreed to pay  billion for power over the next  years newspaper publishers sued davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal during the electricity crisis the davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption these efforts the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a  reduction in electricity usage from june  to june  gray davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that davis did all he could some critics on the left such as arianna huffington alleged that davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers some of davis energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis in addition the democraticcontrolled legislature would sometimes push davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities some conservatives argued that davis signed overpriced energy contracts employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in san diego which they argue could have given davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation the electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to davis recall davis giving a speech on energy in a speech at ucla on august   davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis but then forcefully attacked the houstonbased energy suppliers i inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers we got no help from the federal government in fact when i was fighting enron and the other energy companies these same companies were sitting down with vice president cheney to draft a national energy strategy when the enron verdicts were rendered years later convicting enron and other companies of market manipulation davis responded with the following quote “ ken lay and jeffrey skilling more than anyone are the reason im talking to you now from this law firm ” on november   shortly before leaving office davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on january   the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants during that time california issued licenses to  new power plants amounting to  megawatts of electricity production when completed in  the los angeles times published an article that credited davis signing of the long term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing california a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy in march  the federal energy regulatory commissions longawaited report on the socalled energy crisis was released that report mostly vindicated davis laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of californias treasury on some  energy trading companies most of which were based in texas budget crisisedit during the economic boom years of the davis administration the california budget expanded to cover davis new programs californias low national k education rankings and davis campaign pledge to help education along with the large majority that elected davis to his first term and his early popularity suggest that a majority of californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when california was in budget surplus polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the california voters under the davis administration taxes were cut by over  billion that included a  billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees the cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a  law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed  percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in  and  davis also vetoed  billion in appropriations during that span davis signing the  state budget the  and  budgets would prove much more difficult to balance with a dramatic drop in state revenue while californias economy was expanding california was producing record budget surpluses under davis even after his tax cuts and new spending according to the california department of finance california had a  surplus at the end of  and california was projected to have a  surplus at the end fiscal year  these surplus monies were left in the treasury davis claimed to be cautious with state finances “ i’m trying to chart a prudent course and keep us somewhere in the middle i don’t want to jump the gun on spending i don’t want to jump the gun on tax relief said davis concerning the budget surpluses on october   ” then the dotcom boom that had been fueling californias record tax revenues burst unexpectedly because of the large number of high tech firms in california and californias dependence on state income taxes when the dotcom boom turned to bust state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the states credit rating became unpopular the beginning shortfall for the  state budget was  billion davis announced that the  budget shortfall would be  billion while the

years of his governorship now arnoldwatchorg a project of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both democrats and republicans called davis a pay to play politician and a sellout during the  election campaign davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the republican primaries against los angeles mayor richard riordan davis claimed that riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record polls showed that as a moderate riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate polls even showed that riordan would defeat davis davis attacked riordian with negative ads in the primary the ads questioned riordans prochoice stance by questioning riordans support of prolife politicians and judges the ads pointed out riordans position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of gray davis who strongly supported it daviss negative ads against riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the  election page led to riordans defeat in the republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate bill simon in the first  weeks of  davis spent  million on ads  million on positive ads boasting of his record  million on negative ads against riordan davis was reelected in the november  general election following a long and bitter campaign against simon marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished simons reputation davis campaign touted californias improving test scores environmental protection health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors davis campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted simons financial fraud scandal the  gubernatorial race was the most expensive in california state history with over  million spent davis campaign was better financed davis had over  million in campaign reserves more than simon in august  davis gained reelection with  of the vote to simons  however the simondavis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall davis won the election but the majority of voters disliked davis and did not approve of his job performance other challengesedit while polls attributed davis declining popularity to the energy and budget problems some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal davis a moderate had some disagreements with the more liberal democraticcontrolled legislature democrat john l burton the leader of the california state senate was davis chief antagonist in  republican leader jim brulte told the los angeles times that davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times i never felt i got to know him  i always felt a little sorry for him davis moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the democratic party during the recall davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal democratic base he had the reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them davis leadership and compromisebuilding skills have also been questioned many of the challenges that california faced during his years required a strong force of personality to forge compromise but davis lacked such skill he was also hurt by redistricting in  that made most districts safe for the incumbent party limiting some legislators need and willingness to compromise when davis was inaugurated he said regarding proposition  im a governor not a judge and vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state even the ones with which he personally disagreed davis defended the law initially but when it was declared unconstitutional ninth circuit court of appeals he did not appeal the decision davis personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic his personality forced him to depend more on political skills such as fundraising to win elections davis tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service as davis left office in  the san francisco chronicle published an editorial discussing his legacy the newspaper claimed that he lacked vision allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a robotic governing style that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships the chronicle commented that davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing davis never showed

insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people he vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college many of davis opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support

davis had a  approval rating and  disapproval rating voters cited disapproval of the states record  billion budget shortfall growing unemployment and dubious campaign contributor connections davis had tried to maintain a middleoftheroad approach but ultimately alienated many of the states liberals who viewed him as too conservative and many conservatives who viewed him as too liberal many were upset that in trying to balance the budget davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons some critics attributed the proposal to the california correctional peace officers associations donations to davis reelection campaign negative sentiment was expressed on talk radio the john and ken show in los angeles called davis gumby in response to his changing positions on issues while mr kabc and al rantel also in los angeles coined the term governor lowbeam as a reference to his alleged mishandling of the electricity crisis and his term as chief of staff for jerry brown who was often mocked as governor moonbeam many talk radio programs played a role in collecting signatures to force a recall election california electricity crisisedit main article california electricity crisis soon after taking office davis was able to fasttrack the first power plant construction in twelve years in april  although the plant did not come on line before the electricity crisis according to the subsequent federal energy regulatory commissions investigation and report numerous energy trading companies many based in texas such as enron corporation illegally restricted their supply to the point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts rolling blackouts affecting  customers hit the san francisco bay area on june   and san diego gas  electric company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in august  on december   suffering from low supply and idled power plants the california independent system operator caiso which manages the california power grid declared the first statewide stage  power alert meaning power reserves were below  percent rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity windmill field outside palm springs hot temperatures were thought to be pushing california to rolling blackouts though it was later discovered that market manipulation was the cause on january   davis declared a state of emergency in response to the electricity crisis speculators led by enron corporation were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks and finally suffered rolling blackouts on january  and  davis stepped in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market since the california power companies were technically bankrupt and had no buying power california agreed to pay  billion for power over the next  years newspaper publishers sued davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal during the electricity crisis the davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption these efforts the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a  reduction in electricity usage from june  to june  gray davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that davis did all he could some critics on the left such as arianna huffington alleged that davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers some of davis energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis in addition the democraticcontrolled legislature would sometimes push davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities some conservatives argued that davis signed overpriced energy contracts employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in san diego which they argue could have given davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation the electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to davis recall davis giving a speech on energy in a speech at ucla on august   davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis but then forcefully attacked the houstonbased energy suppliers i inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers we got no help from the federal government in fact when i was fighting enron and the other energy companies these same companies were sitting down with vice president cheney to draft a national energy strategy when the enron verdicts were rendered years later convicting enron and other companies of market manipulation davis responded with the following quote “ ken lay and jeffrey skilling more than anyone are the reason im talking to you now from this law firm ” on november   shortly before leaving office davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on january   the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants during that time california issued licenses to  new power plants amounting to  megawatts of electricity production when completed in  the los angeles times published an article that credited davis signing of the long term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing california a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy in march  the federal energy regulatory commissions longawaited report on the socalled energy crisis was released that report mostly vindicated davis laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of californias treasury on some  energy trading companies most of which were based in texas budget crisisedit during the economic boom years of the davis administration the california budget expanded to cover davis new programs californias low national k education rankings and davis campaign pledge to help education along with the large majority that elected davis to his first term and his early popularity suggest that a majority of californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when california was in budget surplus polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the california voters under the davis administration taxes were cut by over  billion that included a  billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees the cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a  law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed  percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in  and  davis also vetoed  billion in appropriations during that span davis signing the  state budget the  and  budgets would prove much more difficult to balance with a dramatic drop in state revenue while californias economy was expanding california was producing record budget surpluses under davis even after his tax cuts and new spending according to the california department of finance california had a  surplus at the end of  and california was projected to have a  surplus at the end fiscal year  these surplus monies were left in the treasury davis claimed to be cautious with state finances “ i’m trying to chart a prudent course and keep us somewhere in the middle i don’t want to jump the gun on spending i don’t want to jump the gun on tax relief said davis concerning the budget surpluses on october   ” then the dotcom boom that had been fueling californias record tax revenues burst unexpectedly because of the large number of high tech firms in california and californias dependence on state income taxes when the dotcom boom turned to bust state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the states credit rating became unpopular the beginning shortfall for the  state budget was  billion davis announced that the  budget shortfall would be  billion while the legislative analyst projected a   reelectionedit main article california gubernatorial election  davis began fundraising for his  reelection campaign early in his governorship davis raised  million in  and  million in  both unprecedented sums at the time so early in an elected term davis  and  contributions included contributions from pacific gas  electric and edison international davis also received large contributions from labor groups environmental groups and individuals daviss fundraising efforts attracted much attention university of california berkeleys institute of government studies claimed that davis fundraising skills were second to none in the political arena while senator john mccain called davis  goal of  million disgraceful one article in the san francisco chronicle claimed that davis was raising  a day although davis fundraising pace was criticized by his many detractors arnold schwarzenegger would later collect contributions at a quicker rate during the early years of his governorship now arnoldwatchorg a project of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both democrats and republicans called davis a pay to play politician and a sellout during the  election campaign davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the republican primaries against los angeles mayor richard riordan davis claimed that riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record polls showed that as a moderate riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate polls even showed that riordan would defeat davis davis attacked riordian with negative ads in the primary the ads questioned riordans prochoice stance by questioning riordans support of prolife politicians and judges the ads pointed out riordans position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of gray davis who strongly supported it daviss negative ads against riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the  election page led to riordans defeat in the republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate bill simon in the first  weeks of  davis spent  million on ads  million on positive ads boasting of his record  million on negative ads against riordan davis was reelected in the november  general election following a long and bitter campaign against simon marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished simons reputation davis campaign touted californias improving test scores environmental protection health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors davis campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted simons financial fraud scandal the  gubernatorial race was the most expensive in california state history with over  million spent davis campaign was better financed davis had over  million in campaign reserves more than simon in august  davis gained reelection with  of the vote to simons  however the simondavis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall davis won the election but the majority of voters disliked davis and did not approve of his job performance other challengesedit while polls attributed davis declining popularity to the energy and budget problems some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal davis a moderate had some disagreements with the more liberal democraticcontrolled legislature democrat john l burton the leader of the california state senate was davis chief antagonist in  republican leader jim brulte told the los angeles times that davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times i never felt i got to know him  i always felt a little sorry for him davis moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the democratic party during the recall davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal democratic base he had the reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them davis leadership and compromisebuilding skills have also been questioned many of the challenges that california faced during his years required a strong force of personality to forge compromise but davis lacked such skill he was also hurt by redistricting in  that made most districts safe for the incumbent party limiting some legislators need and willingness to compromise when davis was inaugurated he said regarding proposition  im a governor not a judge and vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state even the ones with which he personally disagreed davis defended the law initially but when it was declared unconstitutional ninth circuit court of appeals he did not appeal the decision davis personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic his personality forced him to depend more on political skills such as fundraising to win elections davis tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service as davis left office in  the san francisco chronicle published an editorial discussing his legacy the newspaper claimed that he lacked vision allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a robotic governing style that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships the chronicle commented that davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing davis never showed emotion to the voters he spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision second termedit davis signs ab  on september   establishing a student loan repayment program for members of the state military forces davis second term which lasted only ten months was dominated by the recall election davis signed into law several controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign including one granting drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people he vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college many of davis opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from hispanics labor union members and liberal democrats ultimately davis did not have as much support from hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his  reelection governorelect arnold schwarzenegger president george w bush and governor gray davis speak to firefighters on november   davis was governor during the southern california fires of  more commonly known as the cedar fire davis declared a state of emergency in los angeles county san bernardino county san diego county and ventura county in october  and deployed the national guard to help with disaster relief by midnovember the greater south los angeles area had been declared a disaster area this enabled federal funding to help repair flooding and weatherrelated damage including the destruction of

sufficient number of citizen signatures were collected for a recall election the initial drive for the recall was fueled by funds from the personal fortune of us rep darrell issa a republican who originally hoped to replace davis himself the  california recall special election was the goal of the dump davis campaign and constituted the first gubernatorial recall in californian history and only the second in us history early in the recall election davis called the recall election an “insult” to the eight million voters who had voted in the  gubernatorial election the davis campaign tried to run against the recall yesno vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him davis tried to depict the recall as a  million waste of money that could allow a candidate with a very small percentage of the vote to become governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative there are no primaries in a recall election davis tried to run “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for california and who had made improvements to education and healthcare early august polls showed that over  supported the recall in september  davis conceded that he had lost touch with the voters and he was trying to correct that with numerous townhall meetings poll numbers in september showed a  drop in the number of california voters who were planning to vote yes on the recall according to some analysts and campaign aides davis town hall meetings and conversations with voters were softening his image many political insiders remarked that davis had made several comebacks and that he should not be counted out of the race despite poll numbers that showed over  planning to vote yes on the recall headlines of gray davis defeat in uc berkeleys newspaper the daily californian the papers headlines read davis terminated a reference to one of then governorelect arnold scharzeneggers movie characters the terminator during the recall davis blamed some of the states problems on his predecessor pete wilson davis claimed that he would have rather raised taxes on the upper tax brackets instead of restoring vehicle registration fees and college student tuition davis called the recall a rightwing effort to rewrite history after losing the fall election last year in a major  minute campaign address that was broadcast statewide davis said the recall was a rightwing power grab by republicans and he blamed republicans in the legislature and in washington for many of the states problems while at the same time he tried to take some of the responsibility for the states problems “ its like the oakland raiders saying to tampa bay we know you beat us but we want to play the super bowl again said davis about the recall ” on october   davis was recalled with  of the votes in favor of the recall and republican arnold schwarzenegger was elected to replace him as governor the bay area and los angeles

electricity crisis soon after taking office davis was able to fasttrack the first power plant construction in twelve years in april  although the plant did not come on line before the electricity crisis according to the subsequent federal energy regulatory commissions investigation and report numerous energy trading companies many based in texas such as enron corporation illegally restricted their supply to the point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts rolling blackouts affecting  customers hit the san francisco bay area on june   and san diego gas  electric company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in august  on december   suffering from low supply and idled power plants the california independent system operator caiso which manages the california power grid declared the first statewide stage  power alert meaning power reserves were below  percent rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity windmill field outside palm springs hot temperatures were thought to be pushing california to rolling blackouts though it was later discovered that market manipulation was the cause on january   davis declared a state of emergency in response to the electricity crisis speculators led by enron corporation were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks and finally suffered rolling blackouts on january  and  davis stepped in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market since the california power companies were technically bankrupt and had no buying power california agreed to pay  billion for power over the next  years newspaper publishers sued davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal during the electricity crisis the davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption these efforts the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a  reduction in electricity usage from june  to june  gray davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that davis did all he could some critics on the left such as arianna huffington alleged that davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers some of davis energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis in addition the democraticcontrolled legislature would sometimes push davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities some conservatives argued that davis signed overpriced energy contracts employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in san diego which they argue could have given davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation the electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to davis recall davis giving a speech on energy in a speech at ucla on august   davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis but then forcefully attacked the houstonbased energy suppliers i inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers we got no help from the federal government in fact when i was fighting enron and the other energy companies these same companies were sitting down with vice president cheney to draft a national energy strategy when the enron verdicts were rendered years later convicting enron and other companies of market manipulation davis responded with the following quote “ ken lay and jeffrey skilling more than anyone are the reason im talking to you now from this law firm ” on november   shortly before leaving office davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on january   the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants during that time california issued licenses to  new power plants amounting to  megawatts of electricity production when completed in  the los angeles times published an article that credited davis signing of the long term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing california a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy in march  the federal energy regulatory commissions longawaited report on the socalled energy crisis was released that report mostly vindicated davis laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of californias treasury on some  energy trading companies most of which were based in texas budget crisisedit during the economic boom years of the davis administration the california budget expanded to cover davis new programs californias low national k education rankings and davis campaign pledge to help education along with the large majority that elected davis to his first term and his early popularity suggest that a majority of californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when california was in budget surplus polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the california voters under the davis administration taxes were cut by over  billion that included a  billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees the cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a  law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed  percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in  and  davis also vetoed  billion in appropriations during that span davis signing the  state budget the  and  budgets would prove much more difficult to balance with a dramatic drop in state revenue while californias economy was expanding california was producing record budget surpluses under davis even after his tax cuts and new spending according to the california department of finance california had a  surplus at the end of  and california was projected to have a  surplus at the end fiscal year  these surplus monies were left in the treasury davis claimed to be cautious with state finances “ i’m trying to chart a prudent course and keep us somewhere in the middle i don’t want to jump the gun on spending i don’t want to jump the gun on tax relief said davis concerning the budget surpluses on october   ” then the dotcom boom that had been fueling californias record tax revenues burst unexpectedly because of the large number of high tech firms in california and californias dependence on state income taxes when the dotcom boom turned to bust state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the states credit rating became unpopular the beginning shortfall for the  state budget was  billion davis announced that the  budget shortfall would be  billion while the legislative analyst projected a   reelectionedit main article california gubernatorial election  davis began fundraising for his  reelection campaign early in his governorship davis raised  million in  and  million in  both unprecedented sums at the time so early in an elected term davis  and  contributions included contributions from pacific gas  electric and edison international davis also received large contributions from labor groups environmental groups and individuals daviss fundraising efforts attracted much attention university of california berkeleys institute of government studies claimed that davis fundraising skills were second to none in the political arena while senator john mccain called davis  goal of  million disgraceful one article in the san francisco chronicle claimed that davis was raising  a day although davis fundraising pace was criticized by his many detractors arnold schwarzenegger would later collect contributions at a quicker rate during the early years of his governorship now arnoldwatchorg a project of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both democrats and republicans called davis a pay to play politician and a sellout during the  election campaign davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the republican primaries against los angeles mayor richard riordan davis claimed that riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record polls showed that as a moderate riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate polls even showed that riordan would defeat davis davis attacked riordian with negative ads in the primary the ads questioned riordans prochoice stance by questioning riordans support of prolife politicians and judges the ads pointed out riordans position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of gray davis who strongly supported it daviss negative ads against riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the  election page led to riordans defeat in the republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate bill simon in the first  weeks of  davis spent  million on ads  million on positive ads boasting of his record  million on negative ads against riordan davis was reelected in the november  general election following a long and bitter campaign against simon marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished simons reputation davis campaign touted californias improving test scores environmental protection health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors davis campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted simons financial fraud scandal the  gubernatorial race was the most expensive in california state history with over  million spent davis campaign was better financed davis had over  million in campaign reserves more than simon in august  davis gained reelection with  of the vote to simons  however the simondavis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall davis won the election but the majority of voters disliked davis and did not approve of his job performance other challengesedit while polls attributed davis declining popularity to the energy and budget problems some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal davis a moderate had some disagreements with the more liberal democraticcontrolled legislature democrat john l burton the leader of the california state senate was davis chief antagonist in  republican leader jim brulte told the los angeles times that davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times i never felt i got to know him  i always felt a little sorry for him davis moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the democratic party during the recall davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal democratic base he had the reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them davis leadership and compromisebuilding skills have also been questioned many of the challenges that california faced during his years required a strong force of personality to forge compromise but davis lacked such skill he was also hurt by redistricting in  that made most districts safe for the incumbent party limiting some legislators need and willingness to compromise when davis was inaugurated he said regarding proposition  im a governor not a judge and vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state even the ones with which he personally disagreed davis defended the law initially but when it was declared unconstitutional ninth circuit court of appeals he did not appeal the decision davis personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic his personality forced him to depend more on political skills such as fundraising to win elections davis tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service as davis left office in  the san francisco chronicle published an editorial discussing his legacy the newspaper claimed that he lacked vision allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a robotic governing style that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships the chronicle commented that davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing davis never showed emotion to the voters he spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision second termedit davis signs ab  on september

controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign including one granting drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people he vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college many of davis opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from hispanics labor union members and liberal democrats ultimately davis did not have as much support from hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his  reelection governorelect arnold schwarzenegger president george w bush and governor gray davis speak to firefighters on november   davis was governor during the southern california fires of  more commonly known

the second in us history early in the recall election davis called the recall election an “insult” to the eight million voters who had voted in the  gubernatorial election the davis campaign tried to run against the recall yesno vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him davis tried to depict the recall as a  million waste of money that could allow a candidate with a very small percentage of the vote to become governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative there are no primaries in a recall election davis tried to run “outside the recall circus”

the us in july  to require automakers to limit auto emissions the law required the california air resources board to obtain the maximum feasible cuts in greenhouse gases emitted by all noncommercial vehicles in  and beyond automakers claimed the law would lead smaller and more expensive cars sold in california on march   davis issued an executive order calling for the removal of mtbe a toxic gasoline additive from gasoline sold in the state in  in order for gas prices to remain reasonable in california while removing mtbe davis asked president george w bush to order the epa to grant california a waiver on the federal minimum oxygen requirement without a waiver california would have to import a much larger amount of ethanol per year and gas prices were projected to increase drastically bush did not grant the waiver and in  davis issued an executive order reversing his earlier executive order daviss actions when it came to regulating business suggested that davis was a more moderate governor he worked to kill a comprehensive bill opposed by banks and insurance companies to protect consumers personal financial information what you saw in the campaign was what you got said uc berkeley professor bruce cain hes tried to negotiate a course between the different interest groups and keep democrats on a more centrist businessoriented track davis approved  billion over five years for more than  transit and highway projects one of those projects was construction on the new eastern section of the bay bridge during  and  california spent millions on onetime projects like buying new rail cars and track improvements declining popularityedit in may  in the middle of the california electricity crisis his numbers declined to  approval and  disapproval by december  davis approval ratings spiked up to  his numbers declined back to the may  level and remained about the same over the next year in april  davis had a  approval rating and  disapproval rating voters cited disapproval of the states record  billion budget shortfall growing unemployment and dubious campaign contributor connections davis had tried to maintain a middleoftheroad approach but ultimately alienated many of the states liberals who viewed him as too conservative and many conservatives who viewed him as too liberal many were upset that in trying to balance the budget davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons some critics attributed the proposal to the california correctional peace officers associations donations to davis reelection campaign negative sentiment was expressed on talk radio the john and ken show in los angeles called davis gumby in response to his changing positions on issues while mr kabc and al rantel also in los angeles coined the term governor lowbeam as a reference to his alleged mishandling of the electricity crisis and his term as chief of staff for jerry brown who was often mocked as governor moonbeam many talk radio programs played a role in collecting signatures to force a recall election california electricity crisisedit main article california electricity crisis soon after taking office davis was able to fasttrack the first power plant construction in twelve years in april  although the plant did not come on line before the electricity crisis according to the subsequent federal energy regulatory commissions investigation and report numerous energy trading companies many based in texas such as enron corporation illegally restricted their supply to the point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts rolling blackouts affecting  customers hit the san francisco bay area on june   and san diego gas  electric company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in august  on december   suffering from low supply and idled power plants the california independent system operator caiso which manages the california power grid declared the first statewide stage  power alert meaning power reserves were below  percent rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity windmill field outside palm springs hot temperatures were thought to be pushing california to rolling blackouts though it was later discovered that market manipulation was the cause on january   davis declared a state of emergency in response to the electricity crisis speculators led by enron corporation were collectively making large profits while the state teetered on the edge for weeks and finally suffered rolling blackouts on january  and  davis stepped in to buy power at highly unfavorable terms on the open market since the california power companies were technically bankrupt and had no buying power california agreed to pay  billion for power over the next  years newspaper publishers sued davis to force him to make public the details of the energy deal during the electricity crisis the davis administration implemented a power conservation program that included television ads and financial incentives to reduce energy consumption these efforts the fear of rolling blackouts and the increased cost of electricity resulted in a  reduction in electricity usage from june  to june  gray davis critics often charge that he did not respond properly to the crisis while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that davis did all he could some critics on the left such as arianna huffington alleged that davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers some of davis energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis in addition the democraticcontrolled legislature would sometimes push davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities some conservatives argued that davis signed overpriced energy contracts employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in san diego which they argue could have given davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation the electricity crisis is considered one of the major factors that led to davis recall davis giving a speech on energy in a speech at ucla on august   davis apologized for being slow to act during the energy crisis but then forcefully attacked the houstonbased energy suppliers i inherited the energy deregulation scheme which put us all at the mercy of the big energy producers we got no help from the federal government in fact when i was fighting enron and the other energy companies these same companies were sitting down with vice president cheney to draft a national energy strategy when the enron verdicts were rendered years later convicting enron and other companies of market manipulation davis responded with the following quote “ ken lay and jeffrey skilling more than anyone are the reason im talking to you now from this law firm ” on november   shortly before leaving office davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on january   the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants during that time california issued licenses to  new power plants amounting to  megawatts of electricity production when completed in  the los angeles times published an article that credited davis signing of the long term projects for preventing future blackouts and providing california a cheap supply of energy with the increasing costs of energy in march  the federal energy regulatory commissions longawaited report on the socalled energy crisis was released that report mostly vindicated davis laying the blame for the energy disruption and raiding of californias treasury on some  energy trading companies most of which were based in texas budget crisisedit during the economic boom years of the davis administration the california budget expanded to cover davis new programs californias low national k education rankings and davis campaign pledge to help education along with the large majority that elected davis to his first term and his early popularity suggest that a majority of californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when california was in budget surplus polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the california voters under the davis administration taxes were cut by over  billion that included a  billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees the cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a  law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed  percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in  and  davis also vetoed  billion in appropriations during that span davis signing the  state budget the  and  budgets would prove much more difficult to balance with a dramatic drop in state revenue while californias economy was expanding california was producing record budget surpluses under davis even after his tax cuts and new spending according to the california department of finance california had a  surplus at the end of  and california was projected to have a  surplus at the end fiscal year  these surplus monies were left in the treasury davis claimed to be cautious with state finances “ i’m trying to chart a prudent course and keep us somewhere in the middle i don’t want to jump the gun on spending i don’t want to jump the gun on tax relief said davis concerning the budget surpluses on october   ” then the dotcom boom that had been fueling californias record tax revenues burst unexpectedly because of the large number of high tech firms in california and californias dependence on state income taxes when the dotcom boom turned to bust state revenues fell while ongoing spending commitments created deficits restoring the licensing fees to pre tax cut levels to close the budget gap and stabilize the states credit rating became unpopular the beginning shortfall for the  state budget was  billion davis announced that the  budget shortfall would be  billion while the legislative analyst projected a   reelectionedit main article california gubernatorial election  davis began fundraising for his  reelection campaign early in his governorship davis raised  million in  and  million in  both unprecedented sums at the time so early in an elected term davis  and  contributions included contributions from pacific gas  electric and edison international davis also received large contributions from labor groups environmental groups and individuals daviss fundraising efforts attracted much attention university of california berkeleys institute of government studies claimed that davis fundraising skills were second to none in the political arena while senator john mccain called davis  goal of  million disgraceful one article in the san francisco chronicle claimed that davis was raising  a day although davis fundraising pace was criticized by his many detractors arnold schwarzenegger would later collect contributions at a quicker rate during the early years of his governorship now arnoldwatchorg a project of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights which is a nonpartisan organization that is critical of both democrats and republicans called davis a pay to play politician and a sellout during the  election campaign davis took the unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the republican primaries against los angeles mayor richard riordan davis claimed that riordan had attacked his record and that his campaign was defending his record polls showed that as a moderate riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate polls even showed that riordan would defeat davis davis attacked riordian with negative ads in the primary the ads questioned riordans prochoice stance by questioning riordans support of prolife politicians and judges the ads pointed out riordans position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of gray davis who strongly supported it daviss negative ads against riordan and a variety of other equally important factors explained on the  election page led to riordans defeat in the republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate bill simon in the first  weeks of  davis spent  million on ads  million on positive ads boasting of his record  million on negative ads against riordan davis was reelected in the november  general election following a long and bitter campaign against simon marked by accusations of ethical lapses on both sides and widespread voter apathy simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished simons reputation davis campaign touted californias improving test scores environmental protection health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors davis campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted simons financial fraud scandal the  gubernatorial race was the most expensive in california state history with over  million spent davis campaign was better financed davis had over  million in campaign reserves more than simon in august  davis gained reelection with  of the vote to simons  however the simondavis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall davis won the election but the majority of voters disliked davis and did not approve of his job performance other challengesedit while polls attributed davis declining popularity to the energy and budget problems some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal davis a moderate had some disagreements with the more liberal democraticcontrolled legislature democrat john l burton the leader of the california state senate was davis chief antagonist in  republican leader jim brulte told the los angeles times that davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times i never felt i got to know him  i always felt a little sorry for him davis moderate record made it difficult for him to appeal to the core constituency of the democratic party during the recall davis failed to gain the full support he needed from his more liberal democratic base he had the reputation of being beholden to supporters yet unable to satisfy them davis leadership and compromisebuilding skills have also been questioned many of the challenges that california faced during his years required a strong force of personality to forge compromise but davis lacked such skill he was also hurt by redistricting in  that made most districts safe for the incumbent party limiting some legislators need and willingness to compromise when davis was inaugurated he said regarding proposition  im a governor not a judge and vowed to uphold all of the laws of the state even the ones with which he personally disagreed davis defended the law initially but when it was declared unconstitutional ninth circuit court of appeals he did not appeal the decision davis personality was often described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic his personality forced him to depend more on political skills such as fundraising to win elections davis tendency to micromanage his administration made it difficult for people to present opposing views and even drove some out of service as davis left office in  the san francisco chronicle published an editorial discussing his legacy the newspaper claimed that he lacked vision allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a robotic governing style that focused on fundraising instead of personal relationships the chronicle commented that davis was often on the right side of the issues but that being on the right side of the issues alienated the electorate davis lacked charisma and seemed to be more passionate about winning campaigns than governing davis never showed emotion to the voters he spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision second termedit davis signs ab  on september   establishing a student loan repayment program for members of the state military forces davis second term which lasted only ten months was dominated by the recall election davis signed into law several controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign including one granting drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners many of the same rights as married people he vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college many of davis opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from hispanics labor union members and liberal democrats ultimately davis did not have as much support from hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his  reelection governorelect arnold schwarzenegger president george w bush and governor gray davis speak to firefighters on november   davis was governor during the southern california fires of  more commonly known as the cedar fire davis declared a state of emergency in los angeles county san bernardino county san diego county and ventura county in october  and deployed the national guard to help with disaster relief by midnovember the greater south los angeles area had been declared a disaster area this enabled federal funding to help repair flooding and weatherrelated damage including the destruction of thousands of acres of vegetation the cedar fire was the last major event during davis tenure as governor both davis and governorelect schwarzenegger worked to help with disaster relief schwarzenegger went to washington dc and met vice president dick cheney to lobby the federal government for more disaster relief funds recalledit main article california gubernatorial recall election  in july  a sufficient number of citizen signatures were collected for a recall election the initial drive for the recall was fueled by funds from the personal fortune of us rep darrell issa a republican who originally hoped to replace davis himself the  california recall special election was the goal of the dump davis campaign and constituted the first gubernatorial recall in californian history and only the second in us history early in the recall election davis called the recall election an “insult” to the eight million voters who had voted in the  gubernatorial election the davis campaign tried to run against the recall yesno vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him davis tried to depict the recall as a  million waste of money that could allow a candidate with a very small percentage of the vote to become governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative there are no primaries in a recall election davis tried to run “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for california and who had made improvements to education and healthcare early august polls showed that over  supported the recall in september  davis conceded that he had lost touch with the voters and he was trying to correct that with numerous townhall meetings poll numbers in september showed a  drop in the number of california voters who were planning to vote yes on the recall according to some analysts and campaign aides davis town hall meetings and conversations with voters were softening his image many political insiders remarked that davis had made several comebacks and that he should not be counted out of the race despite poll numbers that showed over  planning to vote yes on the recall headlines of gray davis defeat in uc berkeleys newspaper the daily californian the papers headlines read davis terminated a reference to one of then governorelect arnold scharzeneggers movie characters the terminator during the recall davis blamed some of the states problems on his predecessor pete wilson davis claimed that he would have rather raised taxes on the upper tax brackets instead of restoring vehicle registration fees and college student tuition davis called the recall a rightwing effort to rewrite history after losing the fall election last year in a major  minute campaign address that was broadcast statewide davis said the recall was a rightwing power grab by republicans and he blamed republicans in the legislature and in washington for many of the states problems while at the same time he tried to take some of the responsibility for the states problems “ its like the oakland raiders saying to tampa bay we know you beat us but we want to play the super bowl again said davis about the recall ” on october   davis was recalled with  of the votes in favor of the recall and republican arnold schwarzenegger was elected to replace him as governor the bay area and los angeles county were the only regions in california to vote no on the recall davis joined lynn frazier of north dakota who was ousted in  as the only governors in american history to be recalled on the night of the recall davis conceded defeat and thanked california for having elected him in  statewide elections davis mentioned what he defined as the accomplishments of his administration such as improvements in education environmental protection and health insurance for children davis said he would help schwarzenegger in the transition and he later urged his staff to do the same life after politicsedit after leaving public office davis appeared on several shows such as the tonight show with jay leno and the late show with david letterman as well as a cameo on the cbs sitcom yes dear in december  he announced that he was joining the law firm of loeb  loeb davis spends  of his workdays practicing corporate law as of counsel to loeb  loeb in century city a firm where all attorneys wear casual attire even davis american lawyer magazine called the firm one of the best places in the country for legal staff to work davis has done several media interviews about his legacy he appeared prominently in the documentary enron the smartest guys in the room the debate about his legacy and role in the energy woes that proved to be his downfall remains in a cnn interview on august   davis

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
