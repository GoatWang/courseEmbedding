partner of mckinsey  company over the past  years he has spoken and written extensively on strategy organization and financial services bryan has been a frequent contributor to the wall street journal editorial page has had articles published in numerous periodicals including the harvard business review and the mckinsey quarterly and has authored or coauthored several books claudia joyce is a principal of mckinsey  company and a core member of the strategy and organization practices her work has been published on mckinseys knowledge web and in the mckinsey quarterly their new book mobilizing minds aims to deliver a new forward thinking management strategy for creating wealth and uncovering complexity in today’s highgrowth economy the authors take a bold stand companies need to put the same energy and focus into designing their organizations as they have devoted to the design of new products processes or entry into new markets the ideas in the book are based on years of analysis of the world’s highest performing firms and concentrate on a new organizational model with which to generate tens of thousands of dollars of profit per employee by improving how firms mobilize talent improve worker satisfaction and leverage intangible assets hello and welcome what is the message behind your concept of “mobilizing minds” lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce the core message of mobilizing minds is that corporate leaders can consciously design and build organizations that better nurture talent and knowledge leading to substantial increases in returns most companies were designed for the industrial age of the past century when capital was the scarce resource interaction costs where high and hierarchical authority and vertically integrated structures were the keys to efficient operation today superior performance flows from the ability to fit these structures into the present century’s very different sources of wealth creation by remaking the organization to mobilize the mind power of the workforce and tap into its underutilized talents knowledge relationships and skills companies can both help their people to undertake more rewarding productive work and create sources of significant new wealth at relatively low risk you point out that today’s technology while an enabler can also add massive and unnecessary complexity to a company why is this so lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce for a while in the s we thought that digital technology would enable us to overcome our communication challenges – technology would provide new ways that organizations of increasing scale and scope could be managed it was believed that technology would efficiently and effectively facilitate the constant connection of professionals and managers it is true that today’s technology has led to a substantial fall in interaction costs and as such has enabled professionals and managers at well managed companies to interact more cost effectively with one another while digital technology has enabled this interaction eg widespread use of email to simultaneously communicate with multiple parties the decrease in interaction costs has lead to an explosion of communications volume the problem is that this explosion in volume has resulted in a lot of extraneous communication that has wound up wasting energy and creating busywork a recent mckinsey survey of global executives underscored this point highlighting that indeed more time is spent time in interactions  per cent felt the volume of emails voicemails and meetings had significantly increased over the last five years the volume of communications had become unmanageable  per cent of respondents and ineffective  per cent therefore in our view it is less that today’s technology adds complexity as it is that technology reinforces rather than resolves the inherent complexity of today’s companies you talk about organization design as a centerpiece of corporate strategy can you elaborate on this lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce we believe the time has come for corporate leaders to view organizational design as a strategic imperative and highreturn lowrisk opportunity for investment the classic definition of “strategy” is a plan for actions to be taken with which to gain competitive advantage using this definition we believe corporate leaders need to invest more energy than they have invested in the past in taking actions needed to create the strategic organizational capabilities that will enable their companies to thrive we are convinced that in the digital age if you want to create wealth there is almost no better use of the ceo’s time and energy than making the organization work better so if corporate strategy is about preparing the corporation to gain competitive advantage designing a more effective organization is certainly central to this endeavour you espouse an organizational structure along the lines of a military model with a more direct chain of command what are the benefits of this approach lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce we believe that nearly all organizations are replete with opportunities to streamline and simplify the use of hierarchical authority to remove unproductive complexities – while simultaneously increasing that authority’s effectiveness the approach we advocate involves redesigning a company’s hierarchical order thereby improving management’s ability to use hierarchical authority to power a company’s performance the effort centres on defining a “backbone” or central management structure and developing general line management or clear decision authority and accountability for operating performance by a “backbone line structure” we mean a chain of command that puts authority to make tactical decisions close to the front lines by “frontline manager” we mean someone with the authority to set aspirations define tasks and roles assign people and hold them accountable mobilize resources and make decisions for frontline workers we have used military analogies to illustrate both aspects of the model in terms of a backbone line structure in the military there is no ambiguity about who a soldier’s commanding officer is we believe the corporations should move more toward this model than the traditional multiple bosses matrix approach we also believe that the frontline manager should have more authority and accountability to make decisions at the front line as do frontline military officers many organizations will identify with the “silo mentality” you refer to in the book you encourage leaders to eliminate silos but can this really be achieved in practice isn’t it fair to say that an element of competition between departments or functions will always exist lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce your question raises the need to make an important clarification we are not encouraging leaders to eliminate silos rather to develop ways to systematically cross silo walls so that departments functions or business units can find ways to collaborate with one another we believe that individual businesses should be under pressure to perform and peer based competition helps drive performance however this should not come at the expense of collaboration between the units “to let employees unlock knowledge some companies have relied exclusively on big investments in document management systems shared servers and other technology solutions while technology is certainly an important component of knowledge management the solution must also focus on the supply side” we believe that by incorporating a number of “one company” governance approaches outlined in the book such as parallel structure partnership at the top formal networks talent markets and knowledge markets companies can effectively drive collaboration across silos limiting the destructive aspects of silo mentality you state that today’s companies need to be redesigned to remove unproductive complexity can you give us some indication of exactly how big a job this is for a typical corporation as studied in your research lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce designing and successfully completing major organizational change initiatives is difficult and requires enormous commitment focus and patience from top leadership major organizational change is usually a multiyear journey we recommend beginning with a “master plan” that integrates the elements of the organizational design into a holistic mental model the model describes at a highlevel how your organization should operate at a point in the future ie three to five years from now think of yourself as an urban planner one who must deal with the city as it exists undertaking an enterprisewide organizational diagnostic is usually the first step and involves understanding how all the elements of the organization work – what works well and what works poorly at the end of the diagnostic you should be able to sketch out a direction design of the target organization and a game plan rough timing and sequencing for putting it in place once the directional design is approved the target organization design is designed at an increasing level of detail including standardization of roles detailed new backbone line structure installation of new management processes eg performance management in the book you refer to the chequered success rate of knowledge management initiatives what would you cite as the most common mistakes made in this area lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce the most common mistake is to drive knowledge management as a technology initiative most companies have pursued one or more of three unsuccessful paths  build it and they will come to let employees unlock knowledge some companies have relied exclusively on big investments in document management systems shared servers and other technology solutions while technology is certainly an important component of knowledge management the solution must also focus on the supply side are the documents on the system the right quality how can we encourage knowledge submission the demand side will people turn to the system and the market enablers eg knowledge brokers facilitators the typical result a great system with poor quality content and a small user population  tell them what they need to know some companies particularly those with large corporate staffs have tried to push knowledge to users often via internal websites such efforts can be worthwhile as for example when the idea is to distribute topdown messages such as information or new product features still the limitations of any central planning approach apply do the people writing the documents know what knowledge seers really want to know or are they just guessing are the real experts on the topics actually those who are producing the content the typical result most of the knowledge pushed out this way is not very valuable to most frontline employees  let a thousand websites bloom a third approach is to let various organizational units or informal networks solve their knowledge problems by themselves what large company doesn’t have pockets of a few hundred people who are part of an informal network with a common interest in these informal networks those who create knowledge and those who seek it usually know each other and exchange ideas easily usually some senior person in the group cares enough about the knowledge exchange to invest in the supporting technology andor administrative staff to build or maintain a portal while this approach does lead to success in pockets the obvious flaw is that that proliferation of approaches and technological tools with few common protocols or standards typically remains useful only to a small group of workers as a result this approach will provide just a fraction of the potential benefit of exchanging knowledge on a companywide scale along the lines of wikipedia you suggest that a wellrun “companypedia” can be an effective way to disseminate formerly siloed knowledge throughout a large and complex organization why is this so do you have any examples of this idea in action lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce we believe that a companypedia could provide an innovative way for employees to collaborate and share knowledge across the corporation without regard to bureaucracy and reporting lines the companypedia allows the creation of a dynamic work product with multiple contributors that isn’t out of date as soon as it is posted but reflects the latest and best thinking of the collaborators also posting on the companypedia would likely be far less timeconsuming than posting an entry on a traditional knowledge management site we recognize that the use of companypedias is new and as such the risks eg security content qualityaccuracy have not been fully addressed businessweek’s recent article cited several examples of companypedias in action  march 007 “no rest for the wiki the online tools for building collective info banks are making deeper inroads in corporations and rewriting the rules of collaboration” by rachael king these companypedias focused on managing projects tracking news setting meeting agendas posting corporate policies and creating strategy documents at a number of large and complex organizations such as intel ibm sony xerox disney and microsoft for example the article described ibm’s wikicentral which was the forum used by 0 experts from around the corporation to author an “intellectualproperty manifesto” interestingly you suggest that individual employees should be evaluated not only on their personal achievements but also on their contributions to the success of others how could this “contribution” be measured lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce the short answer is it takes some work to incorporate measures of collaboration into the evaluation process in reality we expect there to be multiple sources for developing a “collaboration score” first traditional 60degree feedback or anonymous upward feedback forums can provide solid quantitative input while not perfect they are directionally accurate particularly in highlighting those with distinctively good and those with distinctively bad relative performance secondly a self assessment can be an important input not only does the form itself reinforce what talents and behaviours constitute superior performance it establishes standards for the role it requires the individual to think hard about what he or she has done well and what he or she could have done better finally we believe that personnel committees can play important role in gathering independent input ie confidential interviews with a crosssection of coworkers and superiors and interpreting all sources of input personnel committees which are common in many professional services companies should be created for every significantly sized population of talent in the enterprise we understand that establishing this sort of an approach is incredibly time consuming but we believe it is critical to institutionalize performance evaluations and effectively incorporate collaborative metrics in the evaluation processes according to your final chapter most people “hate” change obviously much of your book promotes changing structures and systems within organizations what do you think are some of the biggest mistakes companies and their leaders make in communicating and implementing change lowell l bryan  claudia i joyce yes much of our book does promote rethinking the structures and systems within organizations in our experience there are three mistakes that we have seen repeated across many situations first in the diagnosis phase we find that very few leaders really understand how their organizations work at the front line and are not willing to release their preconceived notions yes they certainly have some familiarity with hierarchical roles but usually they have very little real knowledge about how key processes work how people acquire knowledge how people are evaluated and so on without a thorough understanding of an organization’s challenges the solutions will likely not address the root causes of complexity “personnel committees which are common in many professional services companies should be created for every significantly sized population of talent in the enterprise…we believe it is critical to institutionalize performance evaluations and effectively incorporate collaborative metrics in the evaluation processes” second in the design phase we find that most companies complete the design at too high of a level when the design is left at the high level eg joint responsibility for hiring it is likely that consensus can be achieved while the underlying questions remain unresolved until implementation at which point disagreements will be blamed on the design and slow implementation finally communication and consistent rolemodelling from the top of the house needs to reinforce why the organization needs to change what changes are expected what the penalties are for not changing leadership needs to celebrate success stories needs to explain midcourse corrections reinforce the logic of change explain the process and manage expectations while all this may seem obvious managers often fail to spend the time and energy to win the hearts and minds of their people in this way june 007 you can order mobilizing minds from wwwamazoncom or wwwamazoncouk about emerald about us company information working for emerald contact us how to find us

read preview academic journal article the mckinsey quarterly the forces reshaping global banking by bryan lowell l read preview article excerpt technology and demography are changing the deep foundations on which traditional financial services rest we find ourselves at a critical midpoint in the halfcenturylong transformation of the worlds financial markets that began in the 970s and will continue well into the next century the last decade has been one of extraordinary upheavals for financial institutions in the united states the next looks as if it may well bring much the same disruption to the markets and institutions of europe and japan many of the defining features of the financial sphere and the players that populate it are in the midst of profound and unstoppable change  change in how financial firms make money in how and by whom they are regulated in where they raise capital in which markets they serve and in what role they play in society it is of course impossible to see exactly what lies at the end of this process of transformation but an understanding of the forces that are driving it  technology globalization emerging markets demographics and the increased willingness of financial firms to compete with one another  can provide some glimpses of where this transformation is heading the limits of banking lets begin with technology since changing technology is in many ways the most fundamental of these forces the first thing to understand about any technology and the production techniques associated with it is that all technologies have limits it is easy to see how these limits will affect the performance and sales of a product when technology and product are closely associated for example the advantages of large graphite tennis racquets over wooden ones are apparent to anyone who has played the game but limits are less apparent in something like banking which draws on thousands of individual technologies yet one of the thoughts id like to stress is that i believe we are beginning to reach the limits of the technology we call banking when funds and effort are first put into developing a new product or process progress is very slow then everything gains momentum as the key knowledge and infrastructure necessary to make advances are put in place finally as more dollars and activity are invested in developing a product or process it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive to make further technical progress as the technology approaches its natural limits as my colleague dick foster has noted no matter how much is invested sailing ships cant be made to go much faster vacuum tubes cant be made to switch on and off much quicker mechanical cash registers cant be made to work a lot better and then along comes a steam ship to replace the sailing ship or a semiconductor arrives to replace the vacuum tube or an electronic cash register turns up to replace the mechanical one in manufacturing businesses the resulting discontinuity usually wipes out the existing producers and the new manufacturers quickly ride a new scurve of performance improvement until that too approaches its limits the rise of securitization what does any of this have to do with banking simply put there is an enormous variety of new hard and soft technologies at work within the banking industry hard technologies include advances in telecommunications computers anlytics software tools and video communications which are enabling participants to have better information at lower cost to integrate this information with thinking communication and analysis and finally to use the resulting knowledge along with other technologies to distribute services to clients more efficiently effectively and economically soft technologies or financial innovation  things like say the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate and currency swaps  often use these hard technologies to rethink the delivery of services
