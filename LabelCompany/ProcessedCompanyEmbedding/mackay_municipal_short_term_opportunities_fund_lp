insights for  “liquidity wars” require active management and may create investment opportunities in  january    am eastern standard time princeton njbusiness wiremackay municipal managers™ the municipal bond team of fixed income investment advisory firm mackay shields llc today delivered its top five municipal market insights for  key highlights include market disruptions likely – both probability and severity will be elevatedactive management of municipal assets will be essential as we expect market volatility to rise we believe uncertainty tied to the timing and degree of the federal reserve board’s policy adjustments will cause disruptions along the yield curve global economic conditions will likely blur the outlook in the united states and further contribute to market dislocations in our view selected credit events in the municipal market while anticipated will generate incremental volatility market technicals to drive returns  technical conditions to play a greater rolewe believe supply demand and bond structure will impact returns to a much greater degree than in the recent past we expect the municipal market to feel the effects of technical conditions in other markets as investors react to changing conditions across their entire portfolios revenue bonds outperform – defined revenue streams preferred over pension uncertaintywe believe investors will gravitate to the welldefined cash flow streams securing revenue bonds and away from general obligation debt pension issues will likely continue to cause uncertainty over the fiscal health of general obligation issuers new governmental accounting standards board reporting standards may reveal that state and local governments even those that have previously addressed their pension issues still face risks or remain under funded transportation sector outperforms – spending and usage to increasethe  federal transportation bill provides five years of funding for muchneeded infrastructure programs electionyear positioning should motivate congressional support for legislation that promotes jobheavy projects in addition we believe continued economic growth and low energy prices will lead to higher usage of toll roads airports and other port facilities highyield municipals to spring ahead but then investors should fall back to investment gradewe believe high yield municipal bonds should outperform during the first half of the year as investor demand for yield continues however in the latter part of the year we believe investment grade should outperform as the flattening yield curve causes refundings to accelerate active management will be essential to capturing the performance in the relativevalue shift “the key to managing municipal portfolios in  is being cognizant of the movements that influence municipal liquidity we must take into account factors such as more aggressive cash flow demands on municipal mutual funds and the credit implications of lesser liquidity that will impact trading behavior given these market dynamics we believe our approach to managing liquidity in  will create investment opportunities” explained mackay municipal managers™ coheads john
