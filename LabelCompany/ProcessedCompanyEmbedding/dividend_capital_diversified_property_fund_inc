with this offering is found in the section of the prospectus entitled “risk factors” investors should read and understand all of the risk factors before making a decision to invest in shares of dpfs common stock an investment in shares of dpfs common stock involves significant risks including among others there is no public trading market for shares of dpf’s common stock and dpf does not expect that there will ever be a public trading market for its shares so redemption of shares by them will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares dpf’s class a class w and class i share redemption program generally imposes a quarterly cap on aggregate net redemptions of its class a class w and class i share classes equal to the amount of such share classes with a value of up to  of the aggregate net asset value nav of the outstanding shares of such classes as of the last day of the previous quarter dpf may also amend suspend or terminate its share redemption program at any time as a result dpf’s shares have only limited liquidity and may become illiquid a portion of the proceeds received in the public offering of class a class w and class i shares is intended to be used to redeem class e shares which will reduce the net proceeds available to retire debt or acquire additional properties which may reduce its liquidity and profitability the purchase and redemption price for shares of dpf’s common stock will be based on the nav of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market dpf’s nav will not represent dpf’s enterprise value and may not accurately reflect the actual prices at which dpf’s assets could be liquidated on any given day the value a third party would pay for all or substantially all of dpf’s shares or the price that dpf’s shares would trade at on a national stock exchange the board of directors may amend dpf’s nav procedures from time to time some of dpf’s executive officers and directors and other key personnel are also officers directors managers key personnel and  or holders of an ownership interest in its advisor its dealer manager its property manager and  or other entities related to its advisor as a result they face conflicts of interest including but not limited to conflicts arising from time constraints allocation of investment opportunities and the fact that the fees its advisor will receive for services rendered to dpf will be based on dpf’s nav the procedures for which its advisor will assist its board of directors in developing overseeing implementing and coordinating if dpf fails to maintain its status as a reit it would adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders dpfs use of leverage increases the risk of loss on its investments the amount of distributions dpf may make is uncertain are not guaranteed and may be modified at the program’s discretion dpf may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations including without limitation the sale of assets borrowings or offering proceeds including the return of principal amounts invested the use of these sources for distributions would decrease the amount of cash dpf has available for new investments repayment of debt share redemptions and other corporate purposes and could potentially reduce your overall return and dilute the value of your investment in shares of dpf common stock because borrowed funds were used to pay distributions the distribution rate may not be sustainable prior to  dpf’s distributions have historically exceeded its cash flow from operations however for each year from  through  and for the quarters ended june   september   december   and march   distributions were funded solely from cash flow from operations the distributions for the three months ended march   were funded  from cash flow from operations and  from other sources the payment of fees by dpf to its advisor its property manager and its dealer manager will reduce the cash available for distribution and will increase the likelihood that investors are unable to recover the amount of their investment in dpf in connection with dpf’s offering it incurs fees and expenses in particular dpf expects to incur a dealer manager and distribution fee which are expected to reduce the amount of distributions received by certain investors and as a result
