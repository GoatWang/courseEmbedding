biblical commentary series written by david l turner and darrel l bock includes the entire nlt text of the books of matthew and mark it provides students pastors and laypeople with uptodate evangelical scholarship designed to increase their exegetical and theological knowledge as the first gospel in the christian canon and the first book of the new testament matthew has attracted significant attention it contains the sermon on the mount the lord’s prayer the beatitudes and end times parables and prophecies it describes the nature of the kingdom of heaven and reveals the messiah to a jewish audience in his accessible commentary david l turner explores the central themes of the gospel of matthew along with interpretive challenges and the relationship between matthew and the other synoptic gospels this commentary also includes a detailed outline of the gospel and an extensive bibliography the gospel of mark contains the shortest and most succinct account of the life of jesus in fact says darrell l bock in the introduction to his commentary “mark is more a gospel of action than of teaching” jesus and his disciples move from city to city and the stories are punctuated by little more than the favorite markan transition “immediately” yet mark more than any other gospel highlights jesus as the suffering son of man and provides rich parallels to old testament themes and the end of the gospel shows that the experience of rejection and suffering challenged even the apostle’s commitment to discipleship both the original and modern readers have much to learn from the gospel of mark and darrell l bocks commentary and exposition with the logos edition of the matthew mark cornerstone biblical commentary you can read the commentary on the text

of the best scholars working today it is an essential tool for pastors students church leaders and lay people who want to understand the text and know how it relates to our lives today like the new

published on inccom the huffington post thought catalog observer and more he is best known for his writings on holistic selfdevelopment mtthewjones contributor inccommtthewjones write a comment credit getty images the energy you bring to each moment is your most valuable asset because it empowers you to make the most out of your time knowing that your time on earth is limited but being unaware of how much time you have places much more value on being able to discern the difference between behaviors that add value and the actions that arent worth the effort and while all people struggle with time management leaders in particular need to be efficient so they can continue inspiring others as a life coach and licensed therapist ive had the privilege of working with many leaders who are passionate about changing themselves and the world part of our work together is deciding which actions are aligned with their master plan and which behaviors are not aligned with their values through our work ive identified several things that are not worth the time energy and effort that all successful leaders avoid below are  actions that all of the best leaders avoid to maximize their efficiency  always being the first person to speak and share their opinion its easy to get locked into social patterns and when people value your thoughts its quickly established that your opinion matters more than others however collaborative teams are more efficient when you listen more than you speak allow the group to run itself and itll save you time and energy  telling other people what to do rather than embodying the characteristics you value in the long run being the change that you want to see in the world is more efficient than pretending to be someone or something youre not it wastes energy constantly telling everyone to do something that you are unwilling to do yourself because as the leader you dont set the exampleyou are the exampleand people follow actions not words  buying expensive material items to impress people you dont like when you start buying things with the intention of showing others instead of enjoying yourself you need to check in with yourself often trying to impress others is rooted in feelings of inferiority and unfortunately buying things to impress others is an expensive neverending habit a much more efficient strategy is to address the root cause with a therapist or coach  pretending to like thingslike alcohol or sportsto fit in rather than standing out some of my young entrepreneurial clients once pretended to enjoy alcohol despite having celiac disease because they were afraid of being the only one not drinking later in life these clients realized that they wasted years of their lives being miserable when they couldve embraced their individuality dont be afraid to stand out  trying to please other people at the expense of your own wellbeing set appropriate boundaries with yourself and others stop sacrificing your mental physical and emotional health to appease other peopleits not worth it the most effective leaders are the ones that know how to say no  focusing too much on the past or worrying about the future rather than being present the fastest way to waste energy is to live in the past or dream about the future the more present you are the more effective you become because you can only take action in the hereandnow practice being present by reestablishing a meditation practice even if its short  agreeing with other peoples opinions instead of critically thinking for yourself it wastes time to blindly follow others because you end up doing things that arent aligned with the things you value most think critically about yourself and the world around you so that you can make appropriate decisions and be responsible for your actions  sacrificing quality for speed whether were discussing the quality of a product or the quality of employees when you start focusing too much on output you end up wasting energy at one time or another youll have to go back and correct the numerous shortcomings of a hyperfocus on speed rather than careful consideration of quality  comparing yourself to others instead of maximizing your talents no matter what you do someone in this worldprobably a  year old geniusis better than you theres plenty of opportunity to go around so stop wasting time and energy feeling sorry for yourself and start taking action you are your most valuable asset so invest in your own personal and professional growth  avoiding issuesemotional and businessrather than confronting them immediately putting difficult conversations on hold seems efficient at first but can be extremely problematic over time the less you deal with them up front the greater their impact later instead of avoiding uncomfortable dialogues confront them headon if you value your time and want to maximize your energy then as a leader you need to stand outyou need to be the person youve always wanted to become the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on jul   matthew perry puts his la home on the market for m  fox news fox news entertainment
