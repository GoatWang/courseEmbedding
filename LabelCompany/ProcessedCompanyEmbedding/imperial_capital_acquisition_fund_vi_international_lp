imperial obtained more commitments from both categories with repeat lps getting “the first kick at the can” rosenthal said the fund finished with about  percent of its capital coming from wealthy investors and  percent from institutions stephen lister managing partner imperial capital group rosenthal says imperial “could have raised a lot more” especially from the institutional community but not without straying beyond its longstanding market strategy fund vi will show continuity with that strategy making control or minority investments in north american midmarket companies with ebitda of

“it opened our eyes to the opportunities out there and encouraged us to pursue more of them with confidence” he said the ackerman and dental corp deals also confirmed the importance of having strong “valueadding” coinvestment partners like optrust rosenthal said he expects these partners which “augment our tool kit” to play a continued role in fund vi’s dealmaking liquidity windfall along with helping to break new ground for imperial fund v earlier this year realized a major portfolio win in february sti technologies an outsourced pharma services and tech provider was sold to quintilesims

 million target set for its fifth fund imperial capital acquisition fund v pehub canada has learned that’s double the capital committed to the firm’s previous fund which closed in  but imperial is not done yet in an exclusive interview with pehub canada the firm’s cofounder and managing partner jeff rosenthal said “a considerable number” of outstanding commitments are likely to further increase the size of fund v he expects a final close nearer to  million before the end of  that’s not a small achievement in one of the toughest fundraising markets on record what make imperial’s success all the more impressive is that the investor base of its latest fund made up primarily of highnet wealth hnw investors and family offices totals  – a number that might cause heads to spin in the back offices of other pe firms but rosenthal says imperial has since its founding in  had a close rapport with hnw investors that rapport has contributed to an entrepreneurial and partneroriented culture that he and cofounder and managing partner steve lister have cultivated at the firm over the years it’s reflected in imperial’s governance its market relationships and its investment style rosenthal calls it “feel and fit” “steve and i both have entrepreneurial backgrounds and we cut our teeth in the private equity business by working with hnw investors” said rosenthal “these are very creative very successful people” who bring more than just capital commitments he noted they “add value in a host of ways” which includes an important contribution to the firm’s dealmaking opportunities imperial typically makes controlstake investments in lower midmarket companies located across canada and the us enterprises most often have ebitda in the range of  million and  million they also tend to be led by managers with strong entrepreneurial instincts who feel a special resonance with imperial “because they recognize that we are fellow entrepreneurs rather than coming from a large institutional environment” said rosenthal imperial also resonates with business leaders because the firm’s investment pros know a thing or two about the sectors in which they operate long before the current pe trend favouring specialization imperial staked out a niche focus on three key sectors – branded consumer products business services and healthcare rosenthal said this process was “evolutionary not revolutionary” he nonetheless acknowledged that imperial’s accumulated sector knowledge and ability to undertake “deep dive” proprietary research has probably given it a competitive edge when it comes to sourcing opportunities making acquisitions and creating value the firm’s sector practice is evident in kenra an indianapolis indianabased producer of professional hair care products – bought in  following research facilitated by imperial’s ceo partner program an initiative that allows its deal team to tap the expertise of seasoned executives partnering with a revamped company management team imperial helped create a more profitable and focused kenra and solidified its market position at a time of severe economic downturn said rosenthal the enterprise’s sale in  generated a multiple of x invested capital in another example the firm in  acquired cincinnati ohio’s schulman associates irb a provider of clinical research review services to the pharmaceutical sector schulman is perhaps emblematic of the type of companies that most appeal to imperial – the business is necessitybased and recessionresistant and its growth potential is supported by emerging demographic trends imperial saw similar potential in markham ontbased aim health group a healthcare services provider taken private in  with founder and ceo dr lu barbuto the deal freed aim from a “liquidity trap” and gave it new strategic direction said rosenthal within two years two of aim’s divisions were spun out this included the clinical services division which was acquired by a strategic buyer in july thereafter the partners have been able to concentrate on the company’s corporate services unit now operating as workplace health and cost solutions imperial has to date made a dozen platform investments and completed around  addon acquisitions the firm usually aims for a  percent net irr on its deals though its track record has shown net irrs “considerably in excess of that” said rosenthal realizations have tended to triple the firm’s original capital investment there will be no “strategy drift” with fund v despite its larger capital pool imperial will instead undertake a few more sectorspecific investments at consistent size ranges keeping resources available for followons the firm made its first fund v investment in may and is currently planning for two new acquisitions and another exit in the coming months imperial’s year history began when rosenthal and lister met in a real estate transaction in their s at the time “we didn’t know what we didn’t know” said rosenthal but the duo found they had a lot in common in the early s he and lister resolved to raise a pe fund and ended up knocking on the doors of “approximately ” hnw investors the result was a  million close on the firm’s debut fund rosenthal said the firm was really put on the map in an early deal involving engineering consulting specialist stantec founded in  by dr don stanley the company was by  contending with succession issues an “elephant” from imperial’s perspective it was bought with the help of institutional coinvestors and taken public in  the edmonton altabased stantec is today a multibillion dollar corporation with close to  employees and over  locations worldwide photo of jeff rosenthal courtesy of imperial capital group photo of businessman crossing finish line courtesy of shutterstock print
