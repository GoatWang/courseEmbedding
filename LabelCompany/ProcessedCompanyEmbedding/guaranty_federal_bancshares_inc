the first quarter of  and the second quarter of            quarter ended   june    march     june                    dollar amounts in thousands except per share data  net income available to common

same quarter in  and the financial condition results compared to december   interest income – total interest income increased   during the quarter  the average balance of interestearning assets increased   while the yield on average interest earning assets increased  basis points to   the company experienced strong loan activity during the second quarter in which loan balances increased  million however pricing on loans remains very competitive on new and renewing credits this pricing pressure has impacted the ability to maintain loan yield compared to   the yield on loans declined  basis points to  for the second quarter when compared to the same quarter in     interest expense  total interest expense increased   during the quarter  the average balance of interestbearing liabilities increased   while the average cost of interestbearing liabilities increased  basis points to   to fund its asset growth going forward the company will continue to utilize a cost effective mix of retail and commercial deposits along with noncore wholesale funding provision for loan loss expense and allowance for loan losses –based on its reserve analysis and methodology the company recorded a provision for loan loss expense of  during the quarter an increase from the  recognized during the prior year quarter  the provision for the quarter was primarily due to the increased loan balances and increased reserves on a few small problem credits at june   the allowance for loan losses of  million was  of gross loans outstanding excluding mortgage loans held for sale management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a sufficient level to provide for loan losses in the bank’s existing loan portfolio noninterest income –noninterest income increased  during the quarter compared to the same quarter in  primarily due to the company’s mortgage division experiencing another strong quarter resulting in an increase of  in gains on sales of fixedrate mortgage loans  the company also had an increase of  in gains on sale of small business administration “sba” loans compared to the same quarter in   noninterest expense – noninterest expenses increased  over the prior year quarter  this was primarily due to salaries and employee benefits increasing   the company’s recent expansion in the joplin missouri market has created the need for additions of commercial and mortgage staff  the company has also experienced increases in other key areas of operations technology and healthretirement benefits  provision for income taxes – the increase in the provision for income taxes for the quarter is a direct result of the company’s increase in taxable income capital – at june   stockholders’ equity increased to  million compared to  million at december    net income for the six months ended june   exceeded dividends paid or declared by  million  the equity portion of the company’s unrealized losses on availableforsale securities and derivatives improved by  million at june   as compared to december    on a per common share basis stockholders’ equity increased to  at june   as compared to  as of december   from a regulatory capital standpoint all capital ratios for both the company and the bank remain strong and above regulatory requirements asset quality – the company’s nonperforming assets decreased to  million as of june   as compared to  million as of december   nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to  as of june   as compared to  as of december    nongenerally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measures in addition to the gaap financial results presented in this press release the company presents nongaap financial measures discussed below  these nongaap measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the company’s current financial performance  additionally company management believes that this presentation enables meaningful comparison of financial performance in various periods  however the nongaap financial results presented should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with gaap  a limitation of the nongaap financial measures presented is that the adjustments concern gains losses or expenses that the company does expect to continue to recognize the adjustments of these items should not be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual infrequent or nonrecurring  therefore company management believes that both gaap measures of its financial performance and the respective nongaap measures should be considered together  operating incomeoperating income is a nongaap financial measure that adjusts net income for the following nonoperating items gains on sales of availableforsale
