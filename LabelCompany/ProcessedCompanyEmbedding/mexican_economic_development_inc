porfirio díaz – in whose presidency rapid industrialization took place with foreign capital mexican president porfirio díaz brought unprecedented economic growth during the last quarter of the nineteenth century this growth was accompanied by foreign investment and european immigration the development of an efficient railroad network and the exploitation of the countrys natural resources annual economic growth between  and  averaged  political repression and fraud as well as huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions led to the mexican revolution – an armed conflict that drastically transformed mexicos

the year period between  and citation needed the reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades the period from  to  was dubbed by economic historians as the mexican miracle a period of economic growth that followed the end of the mexican revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during peacetime during this period the nation adopted the economic model of import substitution industrialization isi which protected and promoted the development of national industries mexico experienced an economic boom through which industries rapidly expanded their production important changes in the economic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the concept of ejido the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies the introduction of social rights into the constitution the birth of large and influential labor unions and the upgrading of infrastructure while population doubled from  to  gdp increased sixfold during the same period president josé lópez portillo  during whose administration the economy soared with the discovery of oil and then crashed when the price dropped growth while under the isi model had reached its peak in the late s during the s the presidential administrations of echeverría – and lópez portillo – tried to include social development in their policies an effort that entailed more public spending with the discovery of vast oil fields in a time in which oil prices were surging and international interest rates were low and even negative the government decided to borrow from international capital markets to invest in the stateowned oil company which in turn seemed to provide a longrun income source to promote social welfare this method produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure and

president lópez portillo – just before ending his administration suspended payments of foreign debt devalued the peso and nationalized the banking system along with many other industries that were severely affected by the crisis among them the steel industry while import substitution had been in use during an era of industrialization by the s it was evident that the protracted protection had produced an uncompetitive industrial sector with low productivity gains president de la madrid – was the first of a series of presidents that began to implement neoliberal reforms after the crisis of  lenders were unwilling to return to mexico and in order to keep the current account in balance the government resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked unprecedented inflation which reached a historic high in  at  the first step toward the liberalization of trade was mexicos signature of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in  under president de la madrid during the salinas administration – many stateowned companies were privatized the telephone company telmex a government monopoly became a private monopoly sold to carlos slim also not opened to private investors were the government oil company pemex or the energy sector furthermore the banking system that had been nationalized in the waning hours of the lópez portillo administration in  were privatized but with the exclusion of foreign banks salinas pushed for mexicos inclusion in the north american free trade agreement expanding it from a uscanada agreement the expanded nafta was signed in  after the signature of two additional supplements on environments and labor standards it came into effect on january   salinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum wage increments with the labor union movement under the aging fidel velázquez with the aim of curbing inflation while his strategy was successful in reducing inflation growth averaged only  percent a year by fixing the exchange rate the peso became rapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased causing the current account deficit to reach  of gdp in  the deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars the january  chiapas uprising and the assassinations of the ruling partys presidential candidate in march  luis donaldo colosio and the secretarygeneral of the party and brother of the assistantattorney general josé francisco ruiz massieu in  sent a disquieting message to investors public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos depleting the central banks reserves while portfolio investments which had made up  of total investment flows left the country as fast as they had come in this unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant zedillo administration to abandon the fixed exchange rate the peso sharply devalued and the country entered into an economic crisis in december  the boom in exports as well as an international rescue package crafted by us president bill clinton  helped cushion the crisis in less than  months the economy was growing again and annual rate growth averaged  percent between  and

of mexicos total population living below the national poverty line the huge gap might be explained by the governments adopting the multidimensional poverty method as a way to measure poverty so a person who has an income higher than the international poverty line or well being income line set by the mexican government might fall in the moderate poverty category if he or she has one or more deficiencies related to social rights such as education did not complete studies nutrition malnutrition or obesity or living standards including elemental such as water or electricity and secondary

th article of the mexican constitution than included transfer of land andor free land distribution to peasants and small farmers under the concept of the ejido this program was further extended during president cárdenas administration during the s and continued into the s at varying rates the cooperative agrarian reform which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment since commonly held land could not be used as collateral in an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards this constitutional article was amended in  to allow for the transfer of property rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it with the ability to rent or sell it a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states mainly in sinaloa however privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence up until the s the government encouraged the production of basic crops mainly corn and beans by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the national company for popular subsistence conasupo with trade liberalization however conasupo was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented alianza and procampo alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers this support program provides  million farmers who produce basic commodities mostly corn and which represent  of all farmers with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland this subsidy increased substantially during president foxs administration mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce the amount of imports from the united states this program has been successful and in  roughly only  of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in mexico– as opposed to  of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock and which is barely produced in mexico cropsedit in spite of being a staple in the mexican diet mexicos comparative advantage in agriculture is not in corn but in horticulture tropical fruits and vegetables negotiators of nafta expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture twothirds of mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other laborintensive crops such as fruits nuts vegetables coffee and sugar cane while horticultural trade has drastically increased due to nafta it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production estimated at around  corn production has remained stable at  million metric tons arguably as a result of income support to farmers or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in mexico not only have peasants grown corn for millennia corn originated in mexico mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world potatoesedit the area dedicated to potatoes has changed little since  and

currency policyedit mexico has a floating exchange rate regime the floating exchange originated with reforms initiated after the december  peso crash which had followed an unsustainable adherence to a short band under the new system banco de méxico now makes no commitment to the level of the peso exchange rate although it does employ an automatic mechanism to accumulate foreign reserves it also possesses tools aimed at smoothing out volatility the exchange rate commission sets policy it is made up of six members—three each from the ministry of finance and public credit secretaría de hacienda y crédito publico—shcp and the central bank with the shcp holding the deciding vote in august  banco de méxico initiated a mechanism to acquire foreign reserves when the peso is strong without giving the market signals about a target range for the exchange rate the resulting high levels of reserves mostly from petroleum revenues have helped to improve the terms and conditions on debt mexico places on foreign markets however there is concern that the government relies too heavily on oil income in order to build a healthy base of reserves according to the central bank international reserves stood at us  billion in  in may  banco de méxico launched a program that sells us dollars via a monthly auction with the goal of maintaining a stable but moderate level of reserves from april   through

reference to the growing economies of brazil russia india and china for marketing purposes believe that mexico is going to be the th or th biggest economy in the world by the year  behind china united states india brazil and possibly russia monetary systemedit mexico’s monetary policy was revised following the – financial crisis when officials decided that maintaining general price stability was the best way to contribute to the sustained growth of employment and economic activity as a result banco de méxico has as its primary objective maintaining stability in the purchasing power of the peso it sets an inflation target which requires it to establish corresponding quantitative targets for the growth of the monetary base and for the expansion of net domestic credit the central bank also monitors the evolution of several economic indicators such as the exchange rate differences between observed and projected inflation the results of surveys on the public and specialists’ inflation expectations revisions on collective employment contracts producer prices and the balances of the current and capital accounts a debate continues over whether mexico should switch to a usstyle interest ratetargeting system government officials in favor of a change say that the new system would give them more control over interest rates which are becoming more important as consumer credit levels rise until citation needed mexico used a unique system amongst the oecd countries to control inflation in a mechanism known as the corto lit shortage a mechanism that allowed the central bank to influence market interest rates by leaving the banking system short of its daily demand for money by a predetermined amount if the central bank wanted to push interest rates higher it increased the corto if it wished to lower interest rates it decreased the corto source banxico in april  the central bank began setting a referential overnight interest rate as its monetary policy business regulationedit corruptionedit further information corruption in mexico petty corruption based on exercise of administrative discretion in matters of zoning and business permits is endemic in mexico adding about  to the cost of consumer goods and services an april  article in the new york times reporting payment of bribes to officials throughout mexico in order to obtain construction permits information and other favors resulted in investigations in both the united states and mexico using relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with gross county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant  of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an istatistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macroregional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in  by  this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues tradeedit international trade world

start negotiations with australia for a trade agreement between the two countries north american trade agreementedit main article north american free trade agreement the nafta emblem the north american trade agreement nafta is by far the most important trade agreement mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade with its partners as well as in its scope unlike the rest of the free trade agreements that mexico has signed nafta is more comprehensive in its scope and was complemented by the north american agreement for environmental cooperation naaec and the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc the naaec agreement was a response to environmentalists concerns that companies would relocate to mexico or the united states would lower its standards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the environment the naaec in an aim to be more than a set of environmental regulations established the north american commission for environmental cooperation nacec a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental issues the north american development bank nadbank for assisting and financing investments in pollution reduction and the border environmental cooperation commission becc the nadbank and the becc have provided economic benefits to mexico by financing  projects mostly in the water sector by complementing nafta with the naaec it has been labeled the greenest trade agreement the naalc supplement to nafta aimed to create a foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the naalc it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in north america given its limitations however naalc has not produced and in fact was not intended to achieve convergence in employment productivity and salary trend in north america the agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries in a limited way however immigration of skilled mexican and canadian workers to the united states was permitted under the tn status nafta allows for a wide list of professions most of which require at least a bachelors degree for which a mexican or a canadian citizen can request tn status and temporarily immigrate to the united states unlike the visas available to other countries tn status requires no sponsorship but simply a job offer letter the overall benefits of nafta have been quantified by several economists whose findings have been reported in several publications like the world banks lessons from nafta for la and the caribbean naftas impact on north america and nafta revisited by the institute for international economics they assess that nafta has been positive for mexico whose poverty rates have fallen and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the – economic crisis nonetheless they also state that it has not been enough or fast enough to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in mexico gained open access to the american market promoting exports to the united states the value of mexican cotton and apparel exports to the us grew from  billion in  to  billion in  a record high of  billion in  at the same time the share of mexico’s cotton textile market the us has increased from  percent in  to  percent in citation needed some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture contrary to popular belief the maquiladora program was in place far before nafta in some sense dating all the way back to  a maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into mexico either tariff free nafta or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis  months and then using mexicos relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export prior to nafta maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the mexican government so long as the finished good was for export the us prior to nafta allowed maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the us with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non us raw materials used to produce the good thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries nafta has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of nafta given the overall size of trade between mexico and the united states there are remarkably few trade disputes involving relatively small dollar amounts these disputes are generally settled in wto or nafta panels or through negotiations between the two countries the most significant areas of friction involve trucking sugar high fructose corn syrup and a number of other agricultural products mexican trade facilitation and competitivenessedit a research brief published by the world bank as part of its trade costs and facilitation project suggests that mexico has the potential to substantially increase trade flows and economic growth through trade facilitation reform the study examines the potential impacts of trade facilitation reforms in four areas port efficiency customs administration information technology and regulatory environment including standards the study projects overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of  billion equivalent to  percent of total mexican manufacturing exports for – on the imports side the corresponding figures are  billion and  percent respectively increases in exports including textiles would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment on the imports side mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor although for imports of transport equipment improvements in service sector infrastructure would also be of relative importance see alsoedit small and medium enterprises in mexico list of companies of mexico list of hotels in mexico list of mexican brands referencesedit

historyedit main article economic history of mexico porfirio díaz – in whose presidency rapid industrialization took place with foreign capital mexican president porfirio díaz brought unprecedented economic growth during the last quarter of the nineteenth century this growth was accompanied by foreign investment and european immigration the development of an efficient railroad network and the exploitation of the countrys natural resources annual economic growth between  and  averaged  political repression and fraud as well as huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions led to the mexican revolution – an armed conflict that drastically transformed mexicos political social cultural and economical structure during the twentieth century under a premise of social democracy the war itself left a harsh toll on the economy and population which decreased over the year period between  and citation needed the reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades the period from  to  was dubbed by economic historians as the mexican miracle a period of economic growth that followed the end of the mexican revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during peacetime during this period the nation adopted the economic model of import substitution industrialization isi which protected and promoted the development of national industries mexico experienced an economic boom through which industries rapidly expanded their production important changes in the economic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the concept of ejido the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies the introduction of social rights into the constitution the birth of large and influential labor unions and the upgrading of infrastructure while population doubled from  to  gdp increased sixfold during the same period president josé lópez portillo  during whose administration the economy soared with the discovery of oil and then crashed when the price dropped growth while under the isi model had reached its peak in the late s during the s the presidential administrations of echeverría – and lópez portillo – tried to include social development in their policies an effort that entailed more public spending with the discovery of vast oil fields in a time in which oil prices were surging and international interest rates were low and even negative the government decided to borrow from international capital markets to invest in the stateowned oil company which in turn seemed to provide a longrun income source to promote social welfare this method produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure and president lópez portillo announced that the time had come to manage prosperity as mexico multiplied its oil production to become the worlds fourth largest exporter average annual gdp growth by period –  –  –  –  –   debt crisis   peso crisis  –   us recession   great recession  sources in the period of – the international panorama changed abruptly oil prices plunged and interest rates rose in  president lópez portillo – just before ending his administration suspended payments of foreign debt devalued the peso and nationalized the banking system along with many other industries that were severely affected by the crisis among them the steel industry while import substitution had been in use during an era of industrialization by the s it was evident that the protracted protection had produced an uncompetitive industrial sector with low productivity gains president de la madrid – was the first of a series of presidents that began to implement neoliberal reforms after the crisis of  lenders were unwilling to return to mexico and in order to keep the current account in balance the government resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked unprecedented inflation which reached a historic high in  at  the first step toward the liberalization of trade was mexicos signature of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in  under president de la madrid during the salinas administration – many stateowned companies were privatized the telephone company telmex a government monopoly became a private monopoly sold to carlos slim also not opened to private investors were the government oil company pemex or the energy sector furthermore the banking system that had been nationalized in the waning hours of the lópez portillo administration in  were privatized but with the exclusion of foreign banks salinas pushed for mexicos inclusion in the north american free trade agreement expanding it from a uscanada agreement the expanded nafta was signed in  after the signature of two additional supplements on environments and labor standards it came into effect on january   salinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum wage increments with the labor union movement under the aging fidel velázquez with the aim of curbing inflation while his strategy was successful in reducing inflation growth averaged only  percent a year by fixing the exchange rate the peso became rapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased causing the current account deficit to reach  of gdp in  the deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars the january  chiapas uprising and the assassinations of the ruling partys presidential candidate in march  luis donaldo colosio and the secretarygeneral of the party and brother of the assistantattorney general josé francisco ruiz massieu in  sent a disquieting message to investors public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos depleting the central banks reserves while portfolio investments which had made up  of total investment flows left the country as fast as they had come in this unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant zedillo administration to abandon the fixed exchange rate the peso sharply devalued and the country entered into an economic crisis in december  the boom in exports as well as an international rescue package crafted by us president bill clinton  helped cushion the crisis in less than  months the economy was growing again and annual rate growth averaged  percent between  and  more critical interpretations argue that the crisis and subsequent public bailout preserved renewed and intensified the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of financeled neoliberal capitalism in forms institutionally specific to mexican society president zedillo – and president fox – of the national action party mexico the first opposition party candidate to win a presidential election since the founding of the precursor of the institutional revolutionary party in  continued with trade liberalization during foxs administrations several ftas were signed with latin american and european countries japan and israel and both strove to maintain macroeconomic stability thus mexico became one of the most open countries in the world to trade and the economy base shifted accordingly total trade with the united states and canada tripled and total exports and imports almost quadrupled between  and  the

and extreme poverty while less than  of mexicos population lives below the international poverty line set by the world bank as of  mexicos government estimates that  of mexicos population lives in moderate poverty and  lives in extreme poverty which leads to  of mexicos total population living below the national poverty line the huge gap might be explained by the governments adopting the multidimensional poverty method as a way to measure poverty so a person who has an income higher than the international poverty line or well being income line set by the mexican government might fall in the moderate poverty category if he or she has one or more deficiencies related to social rights such as education did not complete studies nutrition malnutrition or obesity or living standards including elemental such as water or electricity and secondary domestic assets such as refrigerators extreme poverty is defined by the mexican government as persons who have deficiencies in both social rights and an income lower than the well being income line additional figures from sedesol mexicos social development agency estimates that   millions of people live in extreme poverty and suffer from food insecurity recently extensive changes in government economic policy and attempts at reducing government interference through privatization of several sectors for better or worse allowed mexico to remain the biggest economy in latin america until  when it became the secondlargest and a socalled trillion dollar club member despite these changes mexico continues to suffer great

hundreds of cities and counties as well as banking institutions the main states receiving remittances in  were michoacán guanajuato jalisco the state of mexico and puebla which jointly captured  of total remittances in that year several state governments with the support of the federal government have implemented programs to use part of the remittances to finance public works this program called

distribution to peasants and small farmers under the concept of the ejido this program was further extended during president cárdenas administration during the s and continued into the s at varying rates the cooperative agrarian reform which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment since commonly held land could not be used as collateral in an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards this constitutional article was amended in  to allow for the transfer of property rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it with the ability to rent or sell it a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states mainly in sinaloa however privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence up until the s the government encouraged the production of basic crops mainly corn and beans by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the national company for popular subsistence conasupo with trade liberalization however conasupo was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented alianza and procampo alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers this support program provides  million farmers who produce basic commodities mostly corn and which represent  of all farmers with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland this subsidy increased substantially during president foxs administration mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce the amount of imports from the united states this program has been successful and in  roughly only  of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in mexico– as opposed to  of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock and which is barely produced in mexico cropsedit in spite of being a staple in the mexican diet mexicos comparative advantage in agriculture is not in corn but in horticulture tropical fruits and vegetables negotiators of nafta expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture twothirds of mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other laborintensive crops such as fruits nuts vegetables coffee and sugar cane while horticultural trade has drastically increased due to nafta it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production estimated at around  corn production has remained stable at  million metric tons arguably as a result of income support to farmers or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in mexico not only have peasants grown corn for millennia corn originated in mexico mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world potatoesedit the area dedicated to potatoes has changed little since  and average yields have almost tripled since  production reached a record  million tonnes in  per capita consumption of potato in mexico stands at  kg a year very low compared to its maize intake of  kg on average potato farms in mexico are larger than those devoted to more basic food crops potato production in mexico is mostly for commercial purposes the production for household consumption is very small sugar caneedit approximately  mediumsized farmers grow sugar cane in  mexican states currently there are  sugar mills around the country that produced  million tons of sugar in the  crop compared to  million tons in  mexicos sugar industry is characterized by high

that in other latin american countries and developing nations in that it does not function as a mere assembly manufacturer the industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities an example of that is the new volkswagen jetta model with up to  of parts designed in mexico the big three general motors ford and chrysler have been operating in mexico since the s while volkswagen and nissan built their plants in the s later toyota honda bmw and mercedesbenz joined in given the high requirements of north american components in the industry many european and asian parts suppliers have also moved to mexico in puebla alone  industrial partmakers cluster around volkswagen the relatively small domestic car industry is represented by dina

foreign companies have become the landmark of trade in mexico this sector has benefited from nafta in that real income in the maquiladora sector has increased  since  though from the nonmaquiladora sector has grown much faster contrary to popular belief this should be no surprise since maquiladoras products could enter the us dutyfree since the s industry agreement other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement and the share of exports from nonborder states has increased in the last  years while the share of exports from maquiladoraborder states has decreased currently mexico is focusing in developing an aerospace industry and the assembly of helicopter and regional jet aircraft fuselages is taking place foreign firms such as md helicopters bell cessna and bombardier build helicopter aircraft and regional jets fuselages in mexico although the mexican aircraft industry is mostly foreign as is its car industry mexican firms have been founded such as aeromarmi which builds light propeller airplanes and hydra technologies which builds unmanned aerial vehicles such as the s ehécatl other important companies are frisa aerospace that manufactures jet engine parts for the new mitsubishi regional jet and supplies pratwhittney and rolls royce jet engine manufacturers of casings for jet engines and kuo aerospace that builds parts for aircraft landing gear and supplies bombardier plant in querétaro as compared with the united states or countries in western europe a larger sector of mexicos industrial economy is food manufacturing which includes several world class

large number of oem and odm manufactures both foreign and domestic among them include foxconn celestica sanminasci jabil elcoteq falco kimball international compal benchmark electronics plexus lanix and flextronics these companies assemble finished electronics or design and manufacture electronic components on behalf of larger companies such as sony or microsoft using locally sourced components for example the odm flextronics manufactures xbox video games systems in guadalajara mexico for microsoft using components such as power systems and printed circuit boards from a local company falco electronics which acts as the oem engineering and designedit the monterrey institute of technology and higher education is one of mexicos most prestigious technology and engineering universities and is ranked one of the leading engineering institutions in latin america the success and rapid growth of the mexican electronics sector is driven primarily by the relatively low cost of manufacturing and design in mexico its strategic position as a major consumer electronics market coupled with its proximity to both the large north american and south american markets whom mexico shares free trade agreements with government support in the form of low business taxes simplified access to loans and capital for both foreign multinational and domestic startup techbased firms and a very large pool of highly skilled educated labor across all sectors of the tech industry for example german multinational engineering and electronics conglomerate siemens has a significant mexican base which also serves as its business and strategy hub for central american countries and the caribbean region there are almost half a million  students enrolled in electronics engineering programs with an additional  electronics engineers entering the mexican workforce each year and mexico had over half a million  certified electronic engineering professionals employed in  from the late s the mexican electronics industry began to shift away from simple line assembly to more advanced work such as research design and the manufacture of advanced electronics systems such as lcd panels semiconductors printed circuit boards microelectronics microprocessors chipsets and heavy electronic industrial equipment and in  the number of certified engineers being graduated annually in mexico surpassed that of the united states many korean japanese and american appliances sold in the us are actually of mexican design and origin but sold under the oems client names in  one out of every four consumer appliances sold in the united states was of mexican design joint productionedit while many foreign companies like phillips vizio and lg simply install wholly owned factories in mexico a number of foreign companies have set up semiindependent joint venture companies with mexican businesses to manufacture and design components in mexico these companies are independently operated from their foreign parent companies and are registered in mexico these local companies function under mexican law and retain a sizable portion of the revenue these companies typically function dually as incompany oem development and design facilities and manufacturing centers and usually produce most components needed to manufacture the finished products an example would by sharp which has formed semex semex was founded as a joint venture between sharp and mexican investors which acts as an autonomous independent company which sharp only maintains partial control over the company manufactures whole products such televisions and designs individual components on behalf of sharp such as lcd modules and in return semex is granted access to sharp capital technology research capacity and branding notable foreign companies which have set up joint venture entities in mexico include samsung which formed samex a local designer and manufacturer of finished televisions white goods and individual electronic components like printed circuit boards lcd panels and semiconductors toshiba who formed toshiba de méxico sa de cv an administratively autonomous subsidiary which produces electronics parts televisions and heavy industrial equipment some of these subsidiaries have grown to expand into multiple branches effectively becoming autonomous conglomerates within their own parent companies sony for example started operations in mexico in  with a group of mexican investors and founded the joint venture sony de mexico which produces led panels lcd modules automotive electronics appliances and printed circuit boards amongst other products for its japanese parent company sony kg sony de mexico has research facilities in monterrey and mexico city designs many of the sony products manufactured in mexico and has now expanded to create its own finance music and entertainment subsidiaries which are mexican registered and independent of their japanese parent corporation domestic industryedit lanix w ilium tablet pc although much of mexicos electronics industry is driven by foreign companies mexico also has a sizeable domestic electronics industry and a number of electronics companies including mabe a major appliance manufacturer and oem which has been functioning since the nineteen fifties and has expanded into the global market meebox a designer and manufacturer desktop and tablet computers solar power panels and electronics components texa which manufactures computers laptops and servers falco a major international manufacturer of electronic components such as printed

banamex one of the oldest surviving financial institutions in mexico by citigroup was the largest usmexico corporate merger at us  billion in spite of that the largest financial institution in mexico is bancomer associated to the spanish bbva the process of institution building in the financial sector in mexico has evolved hand in hand with the efforts of financial liberalization and of inserting the economy more fully into world markets over the recent years there has been a wave of acquisitions by foreign institutions such as usbased citigroup spain’s bbva and the uk’s hsbc their presence along with a better regulatory framework has allowed mexico’s banking system to recover from the – peso devaluation lending to the public and private sector is increasing and so is activity in the

terms of value volume and number of trades mexico’s stockmarket is closely linked to developments in the us thus volatility in the new york and nasdaq stock exchanges as well as interestrate changes and economic expectations in the us can steer the performance of mexican equities this is both because of mexico’s economic dependence on the us and the high volume of trading in mexican equities

stability in the purchasing power of the national currency it is also the lender of last resort currency policyedit mexico has a floating exchange rate regime the floating exchange originated with reforms initiated after the december  peso crash which had followed an unsustainable adherence to a short band under the new system banco de méxico now makes no commitment to the level of the peso exchange rate although it does employ an automatic mechanism to accumulate foreign reserves it also possesses tools aimed at smoothing out volatility the exchange rate commission sets policy it is made up of six members—three each from the ministry of finance and public credit secretaría de hacienda y crédito publico—shcp and the central bank with the shcp holding the deciding vote in august  banco de méxico initiated a mechanism to acquire foreign reserves when the peso is strong without giving the market signals about a target range for the exchange rate the resulting high levels of reserves mostly from petroleum revenues have helped to improve the terms and conditions on debt mexico places on foreign markets however there is concern that the government relies too heavily on oil income in order to build a healthy base of reserves according to the central bank international reserves stood at us  billion in  in may  banco de méxico launched a program that sells us dollars via a

– financial crisis when officials decided that maintaining general price stability was the best way to contribute to the sustained growth of employment and economic activity as a result banco de méxico has as its primary objective maintaining stability in the purchasing power of the peso it sets an inflation target which requires it to establish corresponding quantitative targets for the growth of the monetary base and for the expansion of net domestic credit the central bank also monitors the evolution of several economic indicators such as the exchange rate differences between observed and projected inflation the results of surveys on the public and specialists’ inflation expectations revisions on collective employment contracts producer prices and the balances of the current and capital accounts a debate continues over whether mexico should switch to a usstyle interest ratetargeting system government officials in favor of a change say that the new system would give them more control over interest rates which are becoming more important as consumer credit levels rise until citation needed mexico used a unique system amongst the oecd countries to control inflation in a mechanism known as the corto lit shortage a mechanism that allowed the central bank to influence market interest rates by leaving the banking system short of its daily demand for money by a predetermined amount if the central bank wanted to push interest rates higher it increased the corto if it wished to lower interest rates it decreased the corto source banxico in april  the central bank began setting a referential overnight interest rate as its monetary policy business regulationedit corruptionedit further information corruption in mexico petty corruption based on exercise of administrative discretion in matters of zoning and business permits is endemic in mexico adding about  to the cost of consumer goods and services an april  article in the new york times reporting payment of bribes to officials throughout mexico in order to obtain construction permits information and other favors resulted in investigations in both the united states and mexico using relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with gross county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant  of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an istatistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macroregional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in  by  this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will

countries mexican trade is fully integrated with that of its north american partners close to  of mexican exports and  of its imports are traded with the united states and canada nonetheless nafta has

also started negotiations with south korea singapore and peru and also wishes to start negotiations with australia for a trade agreement between the two countries north american trade agreementedit main article north american free trade agreement the nafta emblem the north american trade agreement nafta is by far the most important trade agreement mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade with its partners as well as in its scope unlike the rest of the free trade agreements that mexico has signed nafta is more comprehensive in its scope and was complemented by the north american agreement for environmental cooperation naaec and the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc the naaec agreement was a response to environmentalists concerns that companies would relocate to mexico or the united states would lower its standards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the environment the naaec in an aim to be more than a set of environmental regulations established the north american commission for environmental cooperation nacec a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental issues the north american development bank nadbank for assisting and financing investments in pollution reduction and the border environmental cooperation commission becc the nadbank and the becc have provided economic benefits to mexico by financing  projects mostly in the water sector by complementing nafta with the naaec it has been labeled the greenest trade agreement the naalc supplement to nafta aimed to create a foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the naalc it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in north america given its limitations however naalc has not produced and in fact was not intended to achieve convergence in employment productivity and salary trend in north america the agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries in a limited way however immigration of skilled mexican and canadian workers to the united states was permitted under the tn status nafta allows for a wide list of professions most of which require at least a bachelors degree for which a mexican or a canadian citizen can request tn status and temporarily immigrate to the united states unlike the visas available to other countries tn status requires no sponsorship but simply a job offer letter the overall benefits of nafta have been quantified by several economists whose findings have been reported in several publications like the world banks lessons from nafta for la and the caribbean naftas impact on north america and nafta revisited by the institute for international economics they assess that nafta has been positive for mexico whose poverty rates have fallen and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the – economic crisis nonetheless they also state that it has not been enough or fast enough to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in mexico gained open access to the american market promoting exports to the united states the value of mexican cotton and apparel exports to the us grew from  billion in  to  billion in  a record high of  billion in  at the same time the share of mexico’s cotton textile market the us has increased from  percent in  to  percent in citation needed some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture contrary to popular belief the maquiladora program was in place far before nafta in some sense dating all the way back to  a maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into mexico either tariff free nafta or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis  months and then using mexicos relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export prior to nafta maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the mexican government so long as the finished good was for export the us prior to nafta allowed maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the us with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non us raw materials used to produce the good thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries nafta has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of nafta given the overall size of trade between mexico and the united states there are remarkably few trade disputes involving relatively small dollar amounts these disputes are generally settled in wto or nafta panels or through negotiations between the two countries the most significant areas of friction involve trucking sugar high fructose corn syrup and a number of other agricultural products mexican trade facilitation and competitivenessedit a research brief published by the world bank as part of its trade costs and facilitation project suggests that mexico has the potential to substantially increase trade flows and economic growth through trade facilitation reform the study examines the potential impacts of trade facilitation reforms in four areas port efficiency customs administration information technology and regulatory environment including standards the study projects overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of  billion equivalent to  percent of total mexican manufacturing exports for – on the imports side the corresponding figures are  billion and  percent respectively increases in exports including textiles would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment on the imports side mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor although for imports of transport equipment improvements in service sector infrastructure would also be of relative importance see alsoedit small and medium enterprises in mexico list of companies of mexico

foreign capital mexican president porfirio díaz brought unprecedented economic growth during the last quarter of the nineteenth century this growth was accompanied by foreign investment and european immigration the development of an efficient railroad network and the exploitation of the countrys natural resources annual economic growth between  and  averaged  political repression and fraud as well as huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions led to the mexican revolution – an armed conflict that drastically transformed mexicos political social cultural and economical structure during the twentieth century under a premise of social democracy the war itself left a harsh toll on the economy and population which decreased over the year period between  and citation needed the reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades the period from  to  was dubbed by economic historians as the mexican miracle a period of economic growth that followed the end of the mexican revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during peacetime during this period the nation adopted the economic model of import substitution industrialization isi which protected and promoted the development of national industries mexico experienced an economic boom through which industries rapidly expanded their production important changes in the economic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the concept of ejido the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies the introduction of social rights into the constitution the birth of large and influential labor unions and the upgrading of infrastructure while population doubled from  to  gdp increased sixfold during the same period president josé lópez portillo  during whose administration the economy soared with the discovery of oil and then crashed when the price dropped growth while under the isi model had reached its peak in the late s during the s the presidential administrations of echeverría – and lópez portillo – tried to include social development in their policies an effort that entailed more public spending with the discovery of vast oil fields in a time in which oil prices were surging and international interest rates were low and even negative the government decided to borrow from international capital markets to invest in the stateowned oil company which in turn seemed to provide a longrun income source to promote social welfare this method produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure and president lópez portillo announced that the time had come to manage prosperity as mexico multiplied its oil production to become the worlds fourth largest exporter average annual gdp growth by period –  –  –  –  –   debt crisis   peso crisis  –   us recession   great recession  sources in the period of – the international panorama changed abruptly oil prices plunged and interest rates rose in  president lópez portillo – just before ending his administration suspended payments of foreign debt devalued the peso and nationalized the banking system along with many other industries that were severely affected by the crisis among them the steel industry while import substitution had been in use during an era of industrialization by the s it was evident that the protracted protection had produced an uncompetitive industrial sector with low productivity gains president de la madrid – was the first of a series of presidents that began to implement neoliberal reforms after the crisis of  lenders were unwilling to return to mexico and in order to keep the current account in balance the government resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked unprecedented inflation which reached a historic high in  at  the first step toward the liberalization of trade was mexicos signature of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in  under president de la madrid during the salinas administration – many stateowned companies were privatized the telephone company telmex a government monopoly became a private monopoly sold to carlos slim also not opened to private investors were the government oil company pemex or the energy sector furthermore the banking system that had been nationalized in the waning hours of the lópez portillo administration in  were privatized but with the exclusion of foreign banks salinas pushed for mexicos inclusion in the north american free trade agreement expanding it from a uscanada agreement the expanded nafta was signed in  after the signature of two additional supplements on environments and labor standards it came into effect on january   salinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum wage increments with the labor union movement under the aging fidel velázquez with the aim of curbing inflation while his strategy was successful in reducing inflation growth averaged only  percent a year by fixing the exchange rate the peso became rapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased causing the current account deficit to reach  of gdp in  the deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars the january  chiapas uprising and the assassinations of the ruling partys presidential candidate in march  luis donaldo colosio and the secretarygeneral of the party and brother of the assistantattorney general josé francisco ruiz massieu in  sent a disquieting message to investors public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos depleting the central banks reserves while portfolio investments which had made up  of total investment flows left the country as fast as they had come in this unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant zedillo administration to abandon the fixed exchange rate the peso sharply devalued and the country entered into an economic crisis in december  the boom in exports as well as an international rescue package crafted by us president bill clinton  helped cushion the crisis in less than  months the economy was growing again and annual rate growth averaged  percent between  and  more critical interpretations argue that the crisis and subsequent public bailout preserved renewed and intensified the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of financeled neoliberal capitalism in forms institutionally specific to mexican society president zedillo – and president fox – of the national action party mexico the first opposition party candidate to win a presidential election since the founding of the precursor of the institutional revolutionary party in  continued with trade liberalization during foxs administrations several ftas were signed with latin american and european countries japan and israel and both strove to maintain macroeconomic stability thus mexico became one of the most open countries in the world to trade and the economy base shifted accordingly total trade with the united states and

world bank as of  mexicos government estimates that  of mexicos population lives in moderate poverty and  lives in extreme poverty which leads to  of mexicos total population living below the national poverty line the huge gap might be explained by the governments adopting the multidimensional poverty method as a way to measure poverty so a person who has an income higher than the international poverty line or well being income line set by the mexican government might fall in the moderate poverty category if he or she has one or more deficiencies related to social rights such as education did not complete studies nutrition malnutrition or obesity or living standards including elemental such as water or electricity and secondary domestic assets such as refrigerators extreme poverty is defined by the mexican government as persons who have deficiencies in both social rights and an income lower than the well being income line additional figures from sedesol mexicos social development agency estimates that   millions of people live in extreme poverty and suffer from food insecurity recently extensive changes in government economic policy and attempts at reducing government

constitution than included transfer of land andor free land distribution to peasants and small farmers under the concept of the ejido this program was further extended during president cárdenas administration during the s and continued into the s at varying rates the cooperative agrarian reform which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment since commonly held land could not be used as collateral in an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards this constitutional article was amended in  to allow for the transfer of property rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it with the ability to rent or sell it a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states mainly in sinaloa however privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence up until the s the government encouraged the production of basic crops mainly corn and beans by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the national company for popular subsistence conasupo with trade liberalization however conasupo was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented alianza and procampo alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers this support program provides  million farmers who produce basic commodities mostly corn and which represent  of all farmers with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland this subsidy increased substantially during president foxs administration mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce the amount of imports from the united states this program has been successful and in  roughly only  of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in mexico– as opposed to  of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock and which is barely produced in mexico cropsedit in spite of being a staple in the mexican diet mexicos comparative advantage in agriculture is not in corn but in horticulture tropical fruits and vegetables negotiators of nafta expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture twothirds of mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other laborintensive crops such as fruits nuts vegetables coffee and sugar cane while horticultural trade has drastically increased due to nafta it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production estimated at around  corn production has remained stable at  million metric tons arguably as a result of income support to farmers or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in mexico not only have peasants grown corn for millennia corn originated in mexico mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world potatoesedit the area dedicated to potatoes has changed little since  and average yields have almost tripled since  production reached a record  million tonnes in  per capita consumption of potato in mexico stands at  kg a year very low compared to its maize intake of  kg on

manufacturer the industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities an example of that is the new volkswagen jetta model with up to  of parts designed in mexico the big three general motors ford and chrysler have been operating in mexico since the s while volkswagen and nissan built their plants in the s later toyota honda bmw and

nafta in that real income in the maquiladora sector has increased  since  though from the nonmaquiladora sector has grown much faster contrary to popular belief this should be no surprise since maquiladoras products could enter the us dutyfree since the s industry agreement other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement and the share of exports from nonborder states has increased in

success and rapid growth of the mexican electronics sector is driven primarily by the relatively low cost of manufacturing and design in mexico its strategic position as a major consumer electronics market coupled with its proximity to both the large north american and south american markets whom mexico shares free trade agreements with government support in the form of low business taxes simplified access to loans and capital for both foreign multinational and domestic startup techbased firms and a very large pool of highly skilled educated labor across all sectors of the tech industry for example german multinational engineering and electronics conglomerate siemens has a significant mexican base which also serves as its business and strategy hub for central american countries and the caribbean region there are almost half a million  students enrolled in electronics engineering programs with an additional  electronics engineers entering the mexican workforce each year and mexico had over half a million  certified electronic engineering professionals employed in  from the late s the mexican electronics industry began to shift away from simple line assembly to more advanced work such as research design and the manufacture of advanced electronics systems such as lcd panels semiconductors printed circuit boards microelectronics microprocessors chipsets and heavy electronic industrial equipment and in  the number of certified engineers being graduated annually in mexico surpassed that of the united states many korean japanese and american appliances sold

productionedit while many foreign companies like phillips vizio and lg simply install wholly owned factories in mexico a number of foreign companies have set up semiindependent joint venture companies with mexican businesses to manufacture and design components in mexico these companies are independently operated from their foreign parent companies and are registered in mexico these local companies function under mexican law and retain a sizable portion of the revenue these companies typically function dually as incompany oem development and design facilities and manufacturing centers and usually produce most components needed to manufacture the finished products an example would by sharp which has formed semex semex was founded as a joint venture between sharp and mexican investors which acts as an autonomous independent company which sharp only maintains partial control over the company manufactures whole products such televisions and designs individual components on behalf of sharp such as lcd modules and in return semex is granted access to sharp capital technology research capacity and branding notable foreign companies which have set up joint venture entities in mexico include samsung which formed samex a local designer and manufacturer of finished televisions white goods and individual electronic components like printed circuit boards lcd panels and semiconductors toshiba who formed toshiba de méxico sa de cv an administratively autonomous subsidiary which produces electronics parts televisions and heavy industrial equipment some of these subsidiaries have

the market signals about a target range for the exchange rate the resulting high levels of reserves mostly from petroleum revenues have helped to improve the terms and conditions on debt mexico places

also monitors the evolution of several economic indicators such as the exchange rate differences between observed and projected inflation the results of surveys on the public and specialists’ inflation expectations revisions on collective employment contracts producer prices and the balances of the current and capital accounts a debate continues over whether mexico should switch to a usstyle interest ratetargeting system government officials in favor of a change say that the new system would give them more control over interest rates which are becoming more important as consumer credit levels rise until citation needed mexico used a unique system amongst the oecd countries to control inflation in a mechanism known as the corto lit shortage a mechanism that allowed the central bank to influence market interest rates by leaving the banking system short of its daily demand for money by a predetermined amount if the central bank wanted to push interest rates higher it increased the corto if it wished to lower interest rates it decreased the corto source banxico in april  the central bank began setting a referential overnight interest rate as its monetary policy

county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant  of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an istatistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macroregional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in  by  this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the

american trade agreement nafta is by far the most important trade agreement mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade with its partners as well as in its scope unlike the rest of the free trade agreements that mexico has signed nafta is more comprehensive in its scope and was complemented by the north american agreement for environmental cooperation naaec and the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc the naaec agreement was a response to environmentalists concerns that companies would relocate to mexico or the united states would lower its standards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the environment the naaec in an aim to be more than a set of environmental regulations established the north american commission for environmental cooperation nacec a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental issues the north american development bank nadbank for assisting and financing investments in pollution reduction and the border environmental cooperation commission becc the nadbank and the becc have provided economic benefits to mexico by financing  projects mostly in the water sector by complementing nafta with the naaec it has been labeled the greenest trade agreement the naalc supplement to nafta aimed to create a foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the naalc it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in north america given its limitations however naalc has not produced and in fact was not intended to achieve convergence in employment productivity and salary trend in north america the agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries in a limited way however immigration of skilled mexican and canadian workers to the united states was permitted under the tn status nafta allows for a wide list of professions most of which require at least a bachelors degree for which a mexican or a canadian citizen can request tn status and temporarily immigrate to the united states unlike the visas available to other countries tn status requires no sponsorship but simply a job offer letter the overall benefits of nafta have been quantified by several economists whose findings have been reported in several publications like the world banks lessons from nafta for la and the caribbean naftas impact on north america and nafta revisited by the institute for international economics they assess that nafta has been positive for mexico whose poverty rates have fallen and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the – economic crisis nonetheless they also state that it has not been enough or fast enough to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in mexico gained open access to the american market promoting exports to the united states the value of mexican cotton and apparel exports to the us grew from  billion in  to  billion in  a record high of  billion in  at the same time the share of mexico’s cotton textile market the us has increased from  percent in  to  percent in citation needed some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture contrary to popular belief the maquiladora program was in place far before nafta in some sense dating all the way back to  a maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into mexico either tariff free nafta or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis  months and then using mexicos relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export prior to nafta maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the mexican government so long as the finished good was for export the us prior to nafta allowed maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the us with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non us raw materials used to produce the good thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries nafta has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of nafta given the overall size of trade between mexico and the united states there are remarkably few trade disputes involving relatively small dollar amounts these disputes are generally settled in wto or nafta panels or through negotiations between the two countries the most significant areas of friction involve trucking sugar high fructose corn syrup and a number of other agricultural products mexican trade facilitation and competitivenessedit a research brief published by the world bank as part of its trade costs and facilitation project suggests that mexico has the potential to substantially increase trade flows and economic growth through trade facilitation reform the study examines the potential impacts of trade facilitation reforms in four areas port efficiency customs administration information technology and regulatory environment including standards the study projects overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of  billion equivalent to  percent of total mexican manufacturing exports for – on the imports side the corresponding figures are  billion and  percent respectively increases in exports including textiles would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment on the imports side mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor although for imports of transport equipment improvements in service sector infrastructure would also be of relative importance see alsoedit small and medium enterprises in mexico list of companies of mexico list of hotels in mexico list of mexican brands referencesedit

historyedit main article economic history of mexico porfirio díaz – in whose presidency rapid industrialization took place with foreign capital mexican president porfirio díaz brought unprecedented economic growth during the last quarter of the nineteenth century this growth was accompanied by foreign investment and european immigration the development of an efficient railroad network and the exploitation of the countrys natural resources annual economic growth between  and  averaged  political repression and fraud as well as huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions led to the mexican revolution – an armed conflict that drastically transformed mexicos political social cultural and economical structure during the twentieth century under a premise of social democracy the war itself left a harsh toll on the economy and population which decreased over the year period between  and citation needed the reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades the period from  to  was dubbed by economic historians as the mexican miracle a period of economic growth that followed the end of the mexican revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during peacetime during this period the nation adopted the economic model of import substitution industrialization isi which protected and promoted the development of national industries mexico experienced an economic boom through which industries rapidly expanded their production important changes in the economic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the concept of ejido the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies the introduction of social rights into the constitution the birth of large and influential labor unions and the upgrading of infrastructure while population doubled from  to  gdp increased sixfold during the same period president josé lópez portillo  during whose administration the economy soared with the discovery of oil and then crashed when the price dropped growth while under the isi model had reached its peak in the late s during the s the presidential administrations of echeverría – and lópez portillo – tried to include social development in their policies an effort that entailed more public spending with the discovery of vast oil fields in a time in which oil prices were surging and international interest rates were low and even negative the government decided to borrow from international capital markets to invest in the stateowned oil company which in turn seemed to provide a longrun income source to promote social welfare this method produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure and president lópez portillo announced that the time had come to manage prosperity as mexico multiplied its oil production to become the worlds fourth largest exporter average annual gdp growth by period –  –  –  –  –   debt crisis   peso crisis  –   us recession   great recession  sources in the period of – the international panorama changed abruptly oil prices plunged and interest rates rose in  president lópez portillo – just before ending his administration suspended payments of foreign debt devalued the peso and nationalized the banking system along with many other industries that were severely affected by the crisis among them the steel industry while import substitution had been in use during an era of industrialization by the s it was evident that the protracted protection had produced an uncompetitive industrial sector with low productivity gains president de la madrid – was the first of a series of presidents that began to implement neoliberal reforms after the crisis of  lenders were unwilling to return to mexico and in order to keep the current account in balance the government resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked unprecedented inflation which reached a historic high in  at  the first step toward the liberalization of trade was mexicos signature of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in  under president de la madrid during the salinas administration – many stateowned companies were privatized the telephone company telmex a government monopoly became a private monopoly sold to carlos slim also not opened to private investors were the government oil company pemex or the energy sector furthermore the banking system that had been nationalized in the waning hours of the lópez portillo administration in  were privatized but with the exclusion of foreign banks salinas pushed for mexicos inclusion in the north american free trade agreement expanding it from a uscanada agreement the expanded nafta was signed in  after the signature of two additional supplements on environments and labor standards it came into effect on january   salinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum wage increments with the labor union movement under the aging fidel velázquez with the aim of curbing inflation while his strategy was successful in reducing inflation growth averaged only  percent a year by fixing the exchange rate the peso became rapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased causing the current account deficit to reach  of gdp in  the deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars the january  chiapas uprising and the assassinations of the ruling partys presidential candidate in march  luis donaldo colosio and the secretarygeneral of the party and brother of the assistantattorney general josé francisco ruiz massieu in  sent a disquieting message to investors public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos depleting the central banks reserves while portfolio investments which had made up  of total investment flows left the country as fast as they had come in this unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant zedillo administration to abandon the fixed exchange rate the peso sharply devalued and the country entered into an economic crisis in december  the boom in exports as well as an international rescue package crafted by us president bill clinton  helped cushion the crisis in less than  months the economy was growing again and annual rate growth averaged  percent between  and  more critical interpretations argue that the crisis and subsequent public bailout preserved renewed and intensified the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of financeled neoliberal capitalism in forms institutionally specific to mexican society president zedillo – and president fox – of the national action party mexico the first opposition party candidate to win a presidential election since the founding of the precursor of the institutional revolutionary party in  continued with trade liberalization during foxs administrations several ftas were signed with latin american and european countries japan and israel and both strove to maintain macroeconomic stability thus mexico became one of the most open countries in the world to trade and the economy base shifted accordingly total trade with the united states and canada tripled and total exports and imports almost quadrupled between  and  the

and extreme poverty while less than  of mexicos population lives below the international poverty line set by the world bank as of  mexicos government estimates that  of mexicos population lives in moderate poverty and  lives in extreme poverty which leads to  of mexicos total population living below the national poverty line the huge gap might be explained by the governments adopting the multidimensional poverty method as a way to measure poverty so a person who has an income higher than the international poverty line or well being income line set by the mexican government might fall in the moderate poverty category if he or she has one or more deficiencies related to social rights such as education did not complete studies nutrition malnutrition or obesity or living standards including elemental such as water or electricity and secondary domestic assets such as refrigerators extreme poverty is defined by the mexican government as persons who have deficiencies in both social rights and an income lower than the well being income line additional figures from sedesol mexicos social development agency estimates that   millions of people live in extreme poverty and suffer from food insecurity recently extensive changes in government economic policy and attempts at reducing government interference through privatization of several sectors for better or worse allowed mexico to remain the biggest economy in latin america until  when it became the secondlargest and a socalled trillion dollar club member despite these changes mexico continues to suffer great social inequality and lack of opportunities the current administration has made an attempt at reducing poverty in the country to provide more opportunities to its citizens such as jobs education and

hundreds of cities and counties as well as banking institutions the main states receiving remittances in  were michoacán guanajuato jalisco the state of mexico and puebla which jointly captured  of total remittances in that year several state governments with the support of the federal government have implemented programs to use part of the remittances to finance public works this program called

distribution to peasants and small farmers under the concept of the ejido this program was further extended during president cárdenas administration during the s and continued into the s at varying rates the cooperative agrarian reform which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment since commonly held land could not be used as collateral in an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards this constitutional article was amended in  to allow for the transfer of property rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it with the ability to rent or sell it a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states mainly in sinaloa however privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence up until the s the government encouraged the production of basic crops mainly corn and beans by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the national company for popular subsistence conasupo with trade liberalization however conasupo was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented alianza and procampo alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers this support program provides  million farmers who produce basic commodities mostly corn and which represent  of all farmers with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland this subsidy increased substantially during president foxs administration mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce the amount of imports from the united states this program has been successful and in  roughly only  of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in mexico– as opposed to  of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock and which is barely produced in mexico cropsedit in spite of being a staple in the mexican diet mexicos comparative advantage in agriculture is not in corn but in horticulture tropical fruits and vegetables negotiators of nafta expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture twothirds of mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other laborintensive crops such as fruits nuts vegetables coffee and sugar cane while horticultural trade has drastically increased due to nafta it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production estimated at around  corn production has remained stable at  million metric tons arguably as a result of income support to farmers or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in mexico not only have peasants grown corn for millennia corn originated in mexico mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world potatoesedit the area dedicated to potatoes has changed little since  and average yields have almost tripled since  production reached a record  million

research and development activities an example of that is the new volkswagen jetta model with up to  of parts designed in mexico the big three general motors ford and chrysler have been operating in mexico since the s while volkswagen and nissan built their plants in the s later toyota honda bmw and mercedesbenz joined in given the high requirements of north american components in the industry many european and asian parts suppliers have also moved to mexico in puebla alone  industrial partmakers cluster around volkswagen the relatively small domestic car industry is represented by dina camiones sa de cv a manufacturer of trucks busses and military vehicles which through domestic production and purchases of foreign bus manufacturers has become the largest bus manufacturer in the world vehizero that builds hybrid trucks and the new car companies mastretta design that builds the mastretta mxt sports car and autobuses king that plans to build  microbuses by  nevertheless new car companies are emerging among them cimex that has developed a sport utility truck the conin and it is to be released in september  in mexicos national auto show and the new electric car maker grupo electrico motorizado some large industries of mexico include cemex the worlds largest construction company and the third largest cement producer the alcohol beverage industries including worldrenowned players like grupo modelo conglomerates like femsa which apart from being the largest single producer of alcoholic beverages and owning multiple commercial interests such oxxo convenience store chain is also the secondlargest cocacola bottler in the world gruma the largest producer of corn flour and tortillas in the world and grupo bimbo telmex televisa among many others in  according to the world bank hightech industrial production represented  of total exports maquiladoras mexican factories which take in imported raw materials and produce goods for domestic consumption and export on behalf of foreign companies have become the landmark of trade in mexico this sector has benefited from nafta in that real income in the maquiladora sector has increased  since  though from the nonmaquiladora sector has grown much faster contrary to popular belief this should be no surprise since maquiladoras products could enter the us dutyfree since the s industry agreement other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement and the share of exports from nonborder states has increased in the last  years while the share of exports from maquiladoraborder states has decreased currently mexico is focusing in developing an aerospace industry and the assembly of helicopter and regional jet aircraft fuselages is taking place foreign firms such as md helicopters bell cessna and bombardier build helicopter aircraft and regional jets fuselages in mexico although the mexican aircraft industry is mostly foreign as is its car industry mexican firms have been founded such as aeromarmi which builds light propeller airplanes and hydra technologies which builds unmanned aerial vehicles such as the s ehécatl other important companies are frisa aerospace that manufactures jet engine parts for the new mitsubishi regional jet and supplies pratwhittney and rolls royce jet engine manufacturers of casings for jet engines and kuo aerospace that builds parts for aircraft landing gear and supplies bombardier plant in querétaro as compared with the united states or countries in western europe a larger sector of mexicos industrial economy is food manufacturing which includes several world class

large number of oem and odm manufactures both foreign and domestic among them include foxconn celestica sanminasci jabil elcoteq falco kimball international compal benchmark electronics plexus lanix and flextronics these companies assemble finished electronics or design and manufacture electronic components on behalf of larger companies such as sony or microsoft using locally sourced components for example the odm flextronics manufactures xbox video games systems in guadalajara mexico for microsoft using components such as power systems and printed circuit boards from a local company falco electronics which acts as the oem engineering and designedit the monterrey institute of technology and higher education is one of mexicos most prestigious technology and engineering universities and is ranked one of the leading engineering institutions in latin america the success and rapid growth of the mexican electronics sector is driven primarily by the relatively low cost of manufacturing and design in mexico its strategic position as a major consumer electronics market coupled with its proximity to both the large north american and south american markets whom mexico shares free trade agreements with government support in the form of low business taxes simplified access to loans and capital for both foreign multinational and domestic startup techbased firms and a very large pool of highly skilled educated labor across all sectors of the tech industry for example german multinational engineering and electronics conglomerate siemens has a significant mexican base which also serves as its business and strategy hub for central american countries and the caribbean region there are almost half a million  students enrolled in electronics engineering programs with an additional  electronics engineers entering the mexican workforce each year and mexico had over half a million  certified electronic engineering professionals employed in  from the late s the mexican electronics industry began to shift away from simple line assembly to more advanced work such as research design and the manufacture of advanced electronics systems such as lcd panels semiconductors printed circuit boards microelectronics microprocessors chipsets and heavy electronic industrial equipment and in  the number of certified engineers being graduated annually in mexico surpassed that of the united states many korean japanese and american appliances sold in the us are actually of mexican design and origin but sold under the oems client names in  one out of every four consumer appliances sold in the united states was of mexican design joint productionedit while many foreign companies like phillips vizio and lg simply install wholly owned factories in mexico a number of foreign companies have set up semiindependent joint venture companies with mexican businesses to manufacture and design components in mexico these companies are independently operated from their foreign parent companies and are registered in mexico these local companies function under mexican law and retain a sizable portion of the revenue these companies typically function dually as incompany oem development and design facilities and manufacturing centers and usually produce most components needed to manufacture the finished products an example would by sharp which has formed semex semex was founded as a joint venture between sharp and mexican investors which acts as an autonomous independent company which sharp only maintains partial control over the company manufactures whole products such televisions and designs individual components on behalf of sharp such as lcd modules and in return semex is granted access to sharp capital technology research capacity and branding notable foreign companies which have set up joint venture entities in mexico include samsung which formed samex a local designer and manufacturer of finished televisions white goods and individual electronic components like printed circuit boards lcd panels and semiconductors toshiba who formed toshiba de méxico sa de cv an administratively autonomous subsidiary which produces electronics parts televisions and heavy industrial equipment some of these subsidiaries have grown to expand into multiple branches effectively becoming autonomous conglomerates within their own parent companies sony for example started operations in mexico in  with a group of mexican investors and founded the joint venture sony de mexico which produces led panels lcd modules automotive electronics appliances and printed circuit boards amongst other products for its japanese parent company sony kg sony de mexico has research facilities in monterrey and mexico city designs many of the sony products manufactured in mexico and has now expanded to create its own finance music and entertainment subsidiaries which are mexican registered and independent of their japanese parent corporation domestic industryedit lanix w ilium tablet pc although much of mexicos electronics industry is driven by foreign companies mexico also has a sizeable domestic electronics industry and a number of electronics companies including mabe a major appliance manufacturer and oem which has been functioning since the nineteen fifties and has expanded into the global market meebox a designer and manufacturer desktop and tablet computers solar power panels and electronics components texa which manufactures computers laptops and servers falco a major international manufacturer of electronic components such as printed

istatistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macroregional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence

main article north american free trade agreement the nafta emblem the north american trade agreement nafta is by far the most important trade agreement mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade with its partners as well as in its scope unlike the rest of the free trade agreements that mexico has signed nafta is more comprehensive in its scope and was complemented by the north american agreement for environmental cooperation naaec and the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc the naaec agreement was a response to environmentalists concerns that companies would relocate to mexico or the united states would lower its standards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the environment the naaec in an aim to be more than a set of environmental regulations established the north american commission for environmental cooperation nacec a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental issues the north american development bank nadbank for assisting and financing investments in pollution reduction and the border environmental cooperation commission becc the nadbank and the becc have provided economic benefits to mexico by financing  projects mostly in the water sector by complementing nafta with the naaec it has been labeled the greenest trade agreement the naalc supplement to nafta aimed to create a foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the naalc it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in north america given its limitations however naalc has not produced and in fact was not intended to achieve convergence in employment productivity and salary trend in north america the agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries in a limited way however immigration of skilled mexican and canadian workers to the united states was permitted under the tn status nafta allows for a wide list of professions most of which require at least a bachelors degree for which a mexican or a canadian citizen can request tn status and temporarily immigrate to the united states unlike the visas available to other countries tn status requires no sponsorship but simply a job offer letter the overall benefits of nafta have been quantified by several economists whose findings have been reported in several publications like the world banks lessons from nafta for la and the caribbean naftas impact on north america and nafta revisited by the institute for international economics they assess that nafta has been positive for mexico whose poverty rates have fallen and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the – economic crisis nonetheless they also state that it has not been enough or fast enough to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in mexico gained open access to the american market promoting exports to the united states the value of mexican cotton and apparel exports to the us grew from  billion in  to  billion in  a record high of  billion in  at the same time the share of mexico’s cotton textile market the us has increased from  percent in  to  percent in citation needed some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture contrary to popular belief the maquiladora program was in place far before nafta in some sense dating all the way back to  a maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into mexico either tariff free nafta or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis  months and then using mexicos relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export prior to nafta maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the mexican government so long as the finished good was for export the us prior to nafta allowed maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the us with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non us raw materials used to produce the good thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries nafta has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of nafta given the overall size of trade between mexico and the united states there are remarkably few trade disputes involving relatively small dollar amounts these disputes are generally settled in wto or nafta panels or through negotiations between the two countries the most significant areas of friction involve trucking sugar high fructose corn syrup and a number of other agricultural products mexican

information technology and regulatory environment including standards the study projects overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of  billion equivalent to  percent of total mexican manufacturing exports for – on the imports side the corresponding figures are  billion and  percent respectively increases in exports including textiles would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment on the imports side mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor although

immigration the development of an efficient railroad network and the exploitation of the countrys natural resources annual economic growth between  and  averaged  political repression and fraud as well as huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions led to the mexican revolution – an armed conflict that drastically transformed mexicos political social cultural and economical structure during the twentieth century under a premise of social democracy the war itself left a harsh toll on the economy and population which decreased over the year period between  and citation needed the reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades the period from  to  was dubbed by economic historians as the mexican miracle a period of economic growth that followed the end of the mexican revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during peacetime during this period the nation adopted the economic model of import substitution industrialization isi which protected and promoted the development of national industries mexico experienced an economic boom through which industries rapidly expanded their production important changes in the economic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the concept of ejido the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies the introduction of social rights into the constitution the birth of large and influential labor unions and the upgrading of infrastructure while population doubled from  to  gdp increased sixfold during the same period president josé lópez portillo  during whose administration the economy soared with the discovery of oil and then crashed when the price dropped growth while under the isi model had reached its peak in the late s during the s the presidential administrations of echeverría – and lópez portillo – tried to include social development in their policies an effort that entailed more public spending with the discovery of vast oil fields in a time in which oil prices were surging and international interest rates were low and even negative the government decided to borrow from international capital markets to invest in the stateowned oil company which in turn seemed to provide a longrun income source to promote social welfare this method produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure and president lópez portillo announced that the time had come to manage prosperity as

payments of foreign debt devalued the peso and nationalized the banking system along with many other industries that were severely affected by the crisis among them the steel industry while import substitution had been in use during an era of industrialization by the s it was evident that the protracted protection had produced an uncompetitive industrial sector with low productivity gains president de la madrid – was the first of a series of presidents that began to implement neoliberal reforms after the crisis of  lenders were unwilling to return to mexico and in order to keep the current account in balance the government resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked unprecedented inflation which reached a historic high in  at  the first step toward the liberalization of trade was mexicos signature of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in  under president de la madrid during the salinas administration – many stateowned companies were privatized the telephone company telmex a government monopoly became a private monopoly sold to carlos slim also not opened to private investors were the government oil company pemex or the energy sector furthermore the banking system that had been nationalized in the waning hours of the lópez portillo administration in  were privatized but with the exclusion of foreign banks salinas pushed for mexicos inclusion in the north american free trade agreement expanding it from a uscanada agreement the expanded nafta was signed in  after the signature of two additional supplements on environments and labor standards it came into effect on january   salinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum wage increments with the labor union movement under the aging fidel velázquez with the aim of curbing inflation while his strategy was successful in reducing inflation growth averaged only  percent a year by fixing the exchange rate the peso became rapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased causing the current account deficit to reach  of gdp in  the deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars the

general josé francisco ruiz massieu in  sent a disquieting message to investors public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos depleting the central banks reserves while portfolio investments which had made up  of total investment flows left the country as fast as they had come in this unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant zedillo administration to abandon the fixed exchange rate the peso sharply devalued and the country entered into an economic crisis in december  the boom in exports as well as an international rescue package crafted by us president bill clinton  helped cushion the crisis in less than  months the economy was growing again and annual rate growth averaged  percent between  and  more critical interpretations argue that the crisis and subsequent public bailout preserved renewed and intensified the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of financeled neoliberal capitalism in forms institutionally specific to mexican

constitution than included transfer of land andor free land distribution to peasants and small farmers under the concept of the ejido this program was further extended during president cárdenas administration during the s and continued into the s at varying rates the cooperative agrarian reform which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment since commonly held land could not be used as collateral in an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards this constitutional article was amended in  to allow for the transfer of property rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it with the ability to rent or sell it a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states mainly in sinaloa however privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence up until the s the government encouraged the production of basic crops mainly corn and beans by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the national company for popular subsistence conasupo with trade liberalization however conasupo was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented alianza and procampo alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers this support program provides  million farmers who produce basic commodities mostly corn and which represent  of all farmers with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland this subsidy increased substantially during president foxs administration mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce the amount of imports from the united states this program has been successful and in  roughly only  of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in mexico– as opposed to  of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock and which is barely produced in mexico cropsedit in spite of being a staple in the mexican diet mexicos comparative advantage in agriculture is not in corn but in horticulture tropical fruits and vegetables negotiators of nafta expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture twothirds of mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other laborintensive crops such as fruits nuts vegetables coffee and sugar cane while horticultural trade has drastically increased due to nafta it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production estimated at around  corn production has remained stable at  million metric tons arguably as a result of income support to farmers or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in mexico not only have peasants grown corn for millennia corn originated in mexico mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world potatoesedit the area dedicated to potatoes has changed little since  and average

american trade agreement nafta is by far the most important trade agreement mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade with its partners as well as in its scope unlike the rest of the free trade agreements that mexico has signed nafta is more comprehensive in its scope and was complemented by the north american agreement for environmental cooperation naaec and the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc the naaec agreement was a response to environmentalists concerns that companies would relocate to mexico or the united states would lower its standards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the environment the naaec in an aim to be more than a set of environmental regulations established the north american commission for environmental cooperation nacec a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental issues the north american development bank nadbank for assisting and financing investments in pollution reduction and the border environmental cooperation commission becc the nadbank and the becc have provided economic benefits to mexico by financing  projects mostly in the water sector by complementing nafta with the naaec it has been labeled the greenest trade agreement the naalc supplement to nafta aimed to create a foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the naalc it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in north america given its limitations however naalc has not produced and in fact was not intended to achieve convergence in employment productivity and salary trend in north america the agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries in a limited way however immigration of skilled mexican and canadian workers to the united states was permitted under the tn status nafta allows for a wide list of professions most of which require at least a bachelors degree for which a mexican or a canadian citizen can request tn status and temporarily immigrate to the united states unlike the visas available to other countries tn status requires no sponsorship but simply a job offer letter the overall benefits of nafta have been quantified by several economists whose findings have been reported in several publications like the world banks lessons from nafta for la and the caribbean naftas impact on north america and nafta revisited by the institute for international economics they assess that nafta has been positive for mexico whose poverty rates have fallen and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the – economic crisis nonetheless they also state that it has not been enough or fast enough to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in mexico gained open access to the american market promoting exports to the united states the value of mexican cotton and apparel exports to the us grew from  billion in  to  billion in  a record high of  billion in  at the same time the share of mexico’s cotton textile market the us has increased from  percent in  to  percent in citation needed some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture contrary to popular belief the maquiladora program was in place far before nafta in some sense dating all the way back to  a maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into mexico either tariff free nafta or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis  months and then using mexicos relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export prior to nafta maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the mexican government so long as the finished good was for export the us prior to nafta allowed maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the us with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non us raw materials used to produce the good thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries nafta has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of nafta given the overall size of trade between mexico and the united states there are remarkably few trade disputes involving relatively small dollar amounts these disputes are generally settled in wto or nafta panels or through negotiations between the two countries the most significant areas of friction involve trucking sugar high fructose corn syrup and a number of other agricultural products mexican trade facilitation and competitivenessedit a research brief published

the study examines the potential impacts of trade facilitation reforms in four areas port efficiency customs administration information technology and regulatory environment including standards the study projects overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of  billion equivalent to  percent of total mexican manufacturing exports for – on the imports side the corresponding figures are  billion and  percent respectively increases in exports including textiles would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment on the imports side mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor although for imports of transport equipment improvements in service sector

economic growth during the last quarter of the nineteenth century this growth was accompanied by foreign investment and european immigration the development of an efficient railroad network and the exploitation of the countrys natural resources annual economic growth between  and  averaged  political repression and fraud as well as huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions led to the mexican revolution – an armed conflict that drastically transformed mexicos political social cultural and economical structure during the twentieth century under a premise of social democracy the war itself left a harsh toll on the economy and population which decreased over the year period between  and citation needed the reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades the period from  to  was dubbed by economic historians as the mexican miracle a period of economic growth that followed the end of the mexican revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during peacetime during this period the nation adopted the economic model of import substitution industrialization isi which protected and promoted the development of national industries mexico experienced an economic boom through which industries rapidly expanded their production important changes in the economic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the concept of ejido the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies the introduction of social rights into the constitution the birth of large and influential labor unions and the upgrading of infrastructure while population doubled from  to  gdp increased sixfold during the same period president josé lópez portillo  during whose administration the economy soared with the discovery of oil and then crashed when the price dropped growth while under the isi model had reached its peak in the late s during the s the presidential administrations of echeverría – and lópez portillo – tried to include social development in their policies an effort that entailed more public spending with the discovery of vast oil fields in a time in which oil prices were surging and international interest rates were low and even negative the government decided to borrow from international capital markets to invest in the stateowned oil company which in turn seemed to provide a longrun income source to promote social welfare this method produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure and president lópez portillo announced that the time had come to manage prosperity as mexico multiplied its oil production to become the worlds fourth largest exporter average annual gdp growth by period –  –  –  –  –   debt crisis   peso crisis  –   us recession   great recession  sources in the period of – the international panorama changed abruptly oil prices plunged and interest rates rose in  president lópez portillo – just before ending his administration suspended payments of foreign debt devalued the peso and nationalized the banking system along with many other industries that were severely affected by the crisis among them the steel industry while import substitution had been in use during an era of industrialization by the s it was evident that the protracted protection had produced an uncompetitive industrial sector with low productivity gains president de la madrid – was the first of a series of presidents that began to implement neoliberal reforms after the crisis of  lenders were unwilling to return to mexico and in order to keep the current account in balance the government resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked unprecedented inflation which reached a historic high in  at  the first step toward the liberalization of trade was mexicos signature of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in  under president de la madrid during the salinas administration – many stateowned companies were privatized the telephone company telmex a government monopoly became a private monopoly sold to carlos slim also not opened to private investors were the government oil company pemex or the energy sector furthermore the banking system that had been nationalized in the waning hours of the lópez portillo administration in  were privatized but with the exclusion of foreign banks salinas pushed for mexicos inclusion in the north american free trade agreement expanding it from a uscanada agreement the expanded nafta was signed in  after the signature of two additional supplements on environments and labor standards it came into effect on january   salinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum wage increments with the labor union movement under the aging fidel velázquez with the aim of curbing inflation while his strategy was successful in reducing inflation growth averaged only  percent a year by fixing the exchange rate the peso became rapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased causing the current account deficit to reach  of gdp in  the deficit was financed through tesobonos a type of public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars the january  chiapas uprising and the assassinations of the ruling partys presidential candidate in march  luis donaldo colosio and the secretarygeneral of the party and brother of the assistantattorney general josé francisco ruiz massieu in  sent a disquieting message to investors public debt holders rapidly sold their tesobonos depleting the central banks reserves while portfolio investments which had made up  of total investment flows left the country as fast as they had come in this unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant zedillo administration to abandon the fixed exchange rate the peso sharply devalued and the country entered into an economic crisis in december  the boom in exports as well as an international rescue package crafted by us president bill clinton  helped cushion the crisis in less than  months the economy was growing again and annual rate growth averaged  percent between  and  more critical interpretations argue that the crisis and subsequent public bailout preserved renewed and intensified the structurally unequal social

and extreme poverty while less than  of mexicos population lives below the international poverty line set by the world bank as of  mexicos government estimates that  of mexicos population lives in moderate poverty and  lives in extreme poverty which leads to  of mexicos total population living below the national poverty line the huge gap might be explained by the governments adopting the multidimensional poverty method as a way to measure poverty so a person who has an income higher than the international poverty line or well being income line set by the mexican government might fall in the moderate poverty category if he or she has one or more deficiencies related to social rights such as education did not complete studies nutrition malnutrition or obesity or living standards including elemental such as water or electricity and secondary domestic assets such as refrigerators extreme poverty is defined by the mexican government as persons who have deficiencies in both

distribution to peasants and small farmers under the concept of the ejido this program was further extended during president cárdenas administration during the s and continued into the s at varying rates the cooperative agrarian reform which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment since commonly held land could not be used as collateral in an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards this constitutional article was amended in  to allow for the transfer of property rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it with the ability to rent or sell it a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states mainly in sinaloa however privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence up until the s the government encouraged the production of basic crops mainly corn and beans by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the national company for popular subsistence conasupo with trade liberalization however conasupo was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented alianza and procampo alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers this support program provides  million farmers who produce basic commodities mostly corn and which represent  of all farmers with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland this subsidy increased substantially during president foxs administration mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce the amount of imports from the united states this program has been successful and in  roughly only  of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in mexico– as opposed to  of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock and which is barely produced in mexico cropsedit in spite of being a staple in the mexican diet mexicos comparative advantage in agriculture is not in corn but in horticulture tropical fruits and vegetables negotiators of nafta expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture twothirds of mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other laborintensive crops such as fruits nuts vegetables coffee and sugar cane while horticultural trade has drastically increased due to nafta it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production estimated at around  corn production has remained stable at  million metric tons arguably as a result of income support to farmers or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in mexico not only have peasants grown corn for millennia corn originated in mexico mexico is the

cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the naalc it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in north america given its limitations however naalc has not produced and in fact was not intended to achieve convergence in employment productivity and salary trend in north america the agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries in a limited way however immigration of skilled mexican and canadian workers to the united states was permitted under the tn status nafta allows for a wide list of professions most of which require at least a bachelors degree for which a mexican or a canadian citizen can request tn status and temporarily immigrate to the united states unlike the visas available to other countries tn status requires no sponsorship but simply a job offer letter the overall benefits of nafta have been quantified by several economists whose findings have been reported in several publications like the world banks lessons from nafta for la and the caribbean naftas impact on north america and nafta revisited by the institute for international economics they assess that nafta has been positive for mexico whose poverty rates have fallen and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the – economic crisis nonetheless they also state that it has not been enough or fast enough to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in mexico gained open access to the american market promoting exports to the united states the value of mexican cotton and apparel exports to the us grew from  billion in  to  billion in  a record high of  billion in  at the same time the share of mexico’s cotton textile market the us has increased from  percent in  to  percent in citation needed some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture contrary to popular belief the maquiladora program was in place far before nafta in some sense dating all the way back to  a maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into mexico either tariff free nafta or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis  months and then using mexicos relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export prior to nafta maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the mexican government so long as the finished good was for export the us prior to nafta allowed maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the us with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non us raw materials used to produce the good thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries nafta has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of nafta given the overall size of trade between mexico and the united states there are remarkably few trade disputes involving relatively small dollar amounts these disputes are generally settled in wto or nafta panels or through negotiations between the two countries the most significant areas of friction involve trucking sugar high fructose corn syrup and a number of other agricultural products mexican trade facilitation and competitivenessedit a research brief published by the world bank as part of its trade costs and facilitation project suggests that mexico has the potential to substantially increase trade flows and economic growth through trade facilitation reform the study examines the potential impacts of trade facilitation reforms in four areas port efficiency customs administration information technology and regulatory environment including standards the study projects overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of  billion equivalent to  percent of total mexican manufacturing exports for – on the imports side the corresponding figures are  billion and  percent respectively increases in exports including textiles would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment on the imports side mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor although for imports of transport equipment improvements in service sector infrastructure would also be of relative importance see alsoedit small and medium enterprises in mexico list of companies of mexico

administration during the s and continued into the s at varying rates the cooperative agrarian reform which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood also caused land fragmentation

economies of scale large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states mainly in sinaloa however privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence up until the s the government encouraged the production of basic crops mainly corn and beans by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the national company for popular subsistence conasupo with trade liberalization however conasupo was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented alianza and procampo alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers this support program provides  million farmers who produce basic commodities mostly corn and which represent  of all farmers with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland this subsidy increased substantially during president foxs administration mainly to white corn producers in order to reduce the amount of imports from the united states this program has been successful and in  roughly only  of corn

of nafta expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture twothirds of mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other laborintensive crops such as fruits nuts vegetables coffee and sugar cane while horticultural trade has drastically increased due to nafta it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production estimated at

county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant  of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an istatistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macroregional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in  by  this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the

mexico is an exportoriented economy it is an important trade power as measured by the value of merchandise traded and the country with the greatest number of free trade agreements in  mexico was the worlds fifteenth largest merchandise exporter and twelfth largest merchandise importer with a  annual percentage increase in overall trade from  to  mexican trade increased fivefold mexico is the biggest exporter and importer in latin america in  mexico alone exported us  billion roughly equivalent to the sum of the exports of brazil argentina venezuela uruguay and paraguay by  mexico ranked once again number  on worlds leading exporters with us  billion and amongst the top ten excluding intraeu countries mexican trade is fully integrated with that of its north american partners close to  of mexican exports and  of its imports are traded with the united states and canada nonetheless nafta has not produced trade diversion while trade with the united states increased  from  to  and that with canada  other trade agreements have shown even more impressive results trade with chile increased  with costa rica  and honduras  trade with the european union increased  over the same time

start negotiations with australia for a trade agreement between the two countries north american trade agreementedit main article north american free trade agreement the nafta emblem the north american trade agreement nafta is by far the most important trade agreement mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade with its partners as well as in its scope unlike the rest of the free trade agreements that mexico has signed nafta is more comprehensive in its scope and was complemented by the north american agreement for environmental cooperation naaec and the north american agreement on labor cooperation naalc the naaec agreement was a response to environmentalists concerns that companies would relocate to mexico or the united states would lower its standards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the environment the naaec in an aim to be more than a set of environmental regulations established the north american commission for environmental cooperation nacec a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental issues the north american development bank nadbank for assisting and financing investments in pollution reduction and the border environmental cooperation commission becc the nadbank and the becc have provided economic benefits to mexico by financing  projects mostly in the water sector by complementing nafta with the naaec it has been labeled the greenest trade agreement the naalc supplement to nafta aimed to create a foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems as well as to promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions though most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact of the naalc it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in north america given its limitations however naalc has not produced and in fact was not intended to achieve convergence in employment productivity and salary trend in north america the agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three countries in a limited way however immigration of skilled mexican and canadian workers to the united states was permitted under the tn status nafta allows for a wide list of professions most of which require at least a bachelors degree for which a mexican or a canadian citizen can request tn status and temporarily immigrate to the united states unlike the visas available to other countries tn status requires no sponsorship but simply a job offer letter the overall benefits of nafta have been quantified by several economists whose findings have been reported in several publications like the world banks lessons from nafta for la and the caribbean naftas impact on north america and nafta revisited by the institute for international economics they assess that nafta has been positive for mexico whose poverty rates have fallen and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the – economic crisis nonetheless they also state that it has not been enough or fast enough to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in mexico gained open access to the american market promoting exports to the united states the value of mexican cotton and apparel exports to the us grew from  billion in  to  billion in  a record high of  billion in  at the same time the share of mexico’s cotton textile market the us has increased from  percent in  to  percent in citation needed some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture contrary to popular belief the maquiladora program was in place far before nafta in some sense dating all the way back to  a maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into mexico either tariff free nafta or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis  months and then using mexicos relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export prior to nafta maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the mexican government so long as the finished good was for export the us prior to nafta allowed maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the us with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non us raw materials used to produce the good thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries nafta has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of nafta given the overall size of trade between mexico and the united states there are remarkably few trade disputes involving relatively small dollar amounts these disputes are generally settled in wto or nafta panels or through negotiations between the two countries the most significant areas of friction involve trucking sugar high fructose corn syrup and a number of other agricultural products mexican trade facilitation and competitivenessedit a research brief published by the world bank as part of its trade costs and facilitation project suggests that mexico has the potential to substantially increase trade flows and economic growth through trade facilitation reform the study examines the potential impacts of trade facilitation reforms in four areas port efficiency customs administration information technology and regulatory environment including standards the study projects overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the order of  billion equivalent to  percent of total mexican manufacturing exports for – on the imports side the corresponding figures are  billion and  percent respectively increases in exports including textiles would result primarily from improvements in port efficiency and the regulatory environment exports of transport equipment would be expected to increase by the greatest increment from improvements in port efficiency whereas exports of food and machinery would largely be the result of improvements in the regulatory environment on the imports side mexican improvements in port efficiency would appear to be the most important factor although for imports of transport equipment improvements in service sector infrastructure would also be of relative importance see alsoedit small and medium enterprises in mexico list of companies of mexico list of hotels in mexico list of mexican brands referencesedit

for most of  and  with an annual average of consumer price inflation of  and  percent respectively nevertheless additional currency weakness and possible nonlinear effects in the passthrough to inflation led to a strong monetary policy response raising the overnight interest rate by a total of  basis points over the past  months to  percent by march  an increase in domestic fuel prices by some  percent in january  raised annual consumer price inflation by february  to  percent a structural change in domestic fuel pricing policies shifting among others to a fixed excise tax on fuels may
