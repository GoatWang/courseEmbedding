rory o’connell sito’s interim ceo rory o’connell thanks joe and thanks to those joining us on the call today i want to emphasize three key points number one is that sito mobile is now hitting our stride  as a focused well organized highly energetic company producing strong revenue growth that will lead to strong operating results number two is that we are wellpositioned to continue building on this momentum and number three is that sito mobile continues to find new applications within mobile media and beyond that further expand our serviceable market and our capabilities as a company providing actionable business intelligence solutions around consumer movement and behavior since taking the reins of sito mobile the management team and i have been focused on implementing the right strategy to deliver value for all stakeholders we have made excellent progress on a number of fronts including restructuring the organization to better align management talent to strategy making important changes to the management team and board these changes include adding lowell robinson as an independent director to the board lowell has  years of seniorlevel strategic financial operational governance and ma experience and has served on seven public company boards previously including tech media and telecom his expertise and unique insight are welcome additions to our board last week we promoted jon lowen to chief operating officer adam meshekow to chief revenue officer and michael blanche to chief technology officer these promotions are not only a recognition of what this team has done together to transition and build this company but also a confident assignment of responsibility as they continue to provide the insight leadership and execution for our next phase of innovation and growth we have also added sales talent and improved our sales management process we’ve improved the product set offering advertisers new visibility into their ad campaign targeting and effectiveness we’ve grown our customer base we’ve increased campaign volumes and dollars we’ve added meaningful channel partners and we’ve begun monetizing our data management platform today sito mobile is a company with a diverse and expanding client base with the ability to leverage its robust media and data platform in the fastgrowing mobile marketing technology space we are focused primarily on reinvigorating our media placement business and expanding sito’s behavioral and movement insights and platform beyond the mobile media industry into other mediums we will go into each of these priorities in more detail shortly but first let’s talk about our number one priority the reinvigoration of our media placement business the consumer marketplace is changing radically as brick and mortar retailers continue to struggle for relevancy in the digital age mobile locationbased marketing and intelligence is a vital strategy for driving local foot traffic into stores we are seeing increasing demand from many retailers who want to better understand and target their prospective client base to drive incremental sales sito mobile’s ability to profile target engage and measure consumers’ movement and behavior via their mobile devices provides real value to a number of different vertical markets we’re growing in automotive consumer goods retail and food service as well as in the entertainment and tourism verticals we’re adding media campaigns and business intelligence initiatives in several departments of state and local government including local and state tourism lottery departments and departments of motor vehicles we are also focused on partnerships with midsize and independent agency businesses these agencies are often regional specialists who run small and mediumsized campaigns focusing on certain demographics and consumer behaviors they are frequently more nimble than the bigger agencies and have shorter sales cycles than large brand clients they are also usually more willing to experiment and innovate and they tend to be quite sticky as sito is often viewed as a critical player in their overall marketing strategy as we integrate our solutions into their core capabilities as one example of how these partnerships can drive revenue for sito mobile we have cultivated a relationship with a fastgrowing agency focused on consumer brands for women that has developed into a sevenfigure client in just two years our sales team is now highly focused on seeking out new middlemarket agencies to demonstrate what our talent and technology are capable of our results thus far are promising larry will provide more detail on our q financials but at a high level our media placement revenue was  million an increase of  to last year’s media placement revenue of  million in q sito ran over  unique campaigns an increase of more than  campaigns compared to the same period last year these campaigns which may run for several months averaged in excess of  for q up from about  a year ago while we normally don’t give guidance especially so early in the quarter we are keeping a promise to do so on this call based upon a breakout april which produced a record  million in revenue we are guiding to a range of  million to  million in revenue in q we are confident that sito mobile will produce the highest revenue in the company’s history by a significant margin in this second quarter now where does sito mobile go from here as i mentioned earlier in addition to reinvigorating our media placement business we are also focused on expanding the application of sito’s behavioral and movement insights beyond our managed service media this is being done twofold first we have rolled out our initial audience behavioral insights product sito labs this is an early step towards merchandizing and monetizing our ownedandoperated technology and dataset with sito labs marketers purchase reports or license our technology in order to use our locationbased data to build custom audiences and understand their customers’ behavior in the physical world they use these custom audiences for planning and marketing purposes beyond only mobile media campaigns several weeks ago we made a joint announcement with screenvision media a national leader in cinema advertising and sito labs’ first customer screenvision media’s network is comprised of over  screens in  plus theater locations across all  states for the first time ever screenvision’s advertising clients have specific insights into their moviegoing audience’s behavior and preferences before and after their intheater ad campaigns sito labs’ audience insights help screenvision’s advertising clients better understand and target their audiences providing better campaign visibility and performance secondly we’ve also recently announced the launch of our realtime verified walkin attribution product as a standalone offering realtime verified walkin can now be included as an addon to campaigns run by other demand side platforms dsps programmatic trade desks and outofhome media providing independent verification and attribution for locationbased campaigns our technology and products are unique in the industry and have successfully driven our managed service business as we look to expand the reach and scale of our offerings into larger brands and tier  agencies we are now able to integrate our unique offerings into these companies’ ad tech infrastructure these are just two early examples of expanding the reach of sito’s behavioral and movement insights beyond the mobile ad business with the development and advancement of these sitobuilt technologies we are finding new ways to utilize data and tech to advance our own mobile offerings we have been able to combine mobile with out of home in order to optimize digital out of home campaigns based on live audiences within viewing distance of a dynamic screen or billboard we have helped large venues like malls airports and casinos better understand what vendors or retailers they should sign in order to draw more consumers and then advertised to these users to drive foot traffic advancement of our vwi platform allows us to optimize towards incremental walkins and lift rather than simply store visits as we continue to build out our technology and as the media industry demands more granularity and transparency we know sito is well positioned to deliver in this resultsoriented market this is exciting stuff for us looking ahead we will continue to execute on our plans we will continue to foster a culture of innovation in order to take advantage of opportunities that did not exist until now and to establish sito as a leader in helping marketers understand consumer movement and behavior we are excited for what the future holds with that i’ll turn the call over to larry for a discussion of our financial results larry firestone thank you rory let’s cover the numbers for q  we saw typical media spending patterns in q where the quarter started off slow and built late quarter bookings momentum that continued as we transitioned into q once again revenue for the first quarter of  was  million a  increase compared to  million in the first quarter of  the increase was driven primarily by growth in the number of clients an increase in the number of campaigns and a rising average value per campaign after q the approximate  in quarterly royalty revenue will go away as the royalty revenue stream has expired we exited the first quarter with a backlog of future billable campaigns of  million of which  million is deliverable in the second quarter this provides us with a great launch point to start q our gross profit for the first quarter of  was  million compared to  million for the first quarter of  this increase coincided with the growth in revenue and gross margin decreased by  percentage point compared to q of  to  and this is the result of a small amount of low margin passthrough revenue as we target continued growth we made some investments in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were  million in the quarter compared to  million in the prior year and up sequentially  from the prior quarter added staff accounted for almost half of the increase in costs and we also increased our spending for marketing with events and materials and incurred some infrastructure costs to balance the rest it takes almost  months for a new salesperson to ramp up and once up to speed we will begin to see a return on investment and as you can see from our guidance our investment in our sales and marketing organization is already paying off excluding nonstandard professional fees general and administrative expenses were  million in q down from  million in the same period last year primarily due to the elimination of stock compensation that were associated with our former executives to be transparent we have carved out and reported on a separate line our nonstandard professional fees which includes charges related to the following activities former executives  the forensic inquiry totaled  for q and this included legal accounting and investigative costs which allowed us to assess the level of indiscretion that the former executives exercised the inquiry has been concluded additionally we have implemented enhanced controls in the areas of cash and credit card authorization as well as payroll and we believe we have successfully mitigated the deficiencies related to these actions there will be approximately  in additional costs related to this item that will hit q as our auditors concluded their work on this matter class action lawsuit  this was the accrual for the some minor legal costs plus the retention which totaled  retention is the term for the do insurance deductible for the class action lawsuit that was filed this retention is accrued and has not been paid as of quarter end and this matter has now been turned over to our attorneys and our insurance company we do not expect additional charges or company outlays of cash related to the class action lawsuit beyond q as this will be covered by our do insurance the  rights plan  next are the costs associated with the implementation of the section  shareholder rights plan we have a gross pretax net operating loss of approximately  million in order to keep the net operating losses from being impaired due to a change in control we implemented what is known as a section  shareholder rights plan having this plan in place will allow shareholders to understand that we have these nols and to protect the value of them as they trade in our stock the change in control can happen unknowingly with trading of larger volumes of stock by one or more of our  holders with a change of control triggering threshold of  as of the measurement date we were at  which is very high and therefore we put the plan in place to protect the company’s largest financial asset we spent approximately  on this effort which is now complete and there will not be ongoing costs associated with this proxy contests  last are the costs associated with the proxy contests for which the activity began in midmarch that totaled  for the first quarter and we continue to spend for the costs of responding to the various proxy contests so far in q we have spent an additional  for the costs related to the proxy contests our loss from continuing operations was  million or  per share for q of  compared to a loss of  million or  per share for q of  although our revenue grew substantially and our gross profit grew along with revenue the investments we made in sales and marketing plus the nearly  in professional fees that were nonstandard more than offset these gains on a nongaap basis backing out the costs associated with depreciation and amortization stock compensation expense interest expense and all of the nonstandard professional fees the adjusted nongaap loss for q of  was  million or  per share compared to a nongaap loss of  or  per share for q of  now onto the balance sheet at march   we had approximately  million in cash down  million sequentially from yearend as we funded our normal operations the debt payments to fortress as well as for extraordinary professional fees that we’ve discussed accounts receivable was  million as of march  down from  million at yearend due to the usual q seasonal revenue drop and collection efforts driving dsos at quarter end down slightly to  days which is higher than we like to see it over the past  weeks we have focused on collections in an effort to clean up some aged balances and reduce the dsos significantly and we have collected over  million since our last call with more to come collections and our cash cycle is now a top priority for the company as we are on a mission to drive our dsos down to a level that is more acceptable we are now in the final year of our loan with fortress the balance of the debt was approximately  million at march   and because of the timing of the balloon payment the longterm portion has now moved into current liabilities beginning with the march payment our principal and interest payment on the fortress loan is approximately  a month and in march of  we have a balloon payment of approximately  million to pay off the loan as i mentioned briefly on the last call we have begun a dialogue with several banks in an effort to secure a credit facility that will allow us to replace the fortress loan with a facility that is easier on our working capital and will help us fund growth as we go forward thank you very much and with that i will turn the call back to rory rory o’connell thanks larry let me now conclude by reiterating the  key points for this earnings call sito mobile is once again a great growth story and i believe we’re just beginning to hit our stride in the last couple of months we’ve improved our products and our operational performance this leads to high customer satisfaction rates which drive campaign volume and dollar growth we now have the right team the right alignment of talent and strategy and the right focus the energy here is palpable and it feels like we’re just getting started sito mobile is an enthusiastic and energized organization that is executing well on the strategic plan but also has its sights set on finding new applications for our great technology we’re in the middle of what will be the biggest revenue quarter in our company’s history and most importantly on top of this success we are finding many new applications and revenue opportunities for our technology and data platform  providing business intelligence by leveraging our mobile movement and behavioral data we really are onto something special here before turning the call over to qa i would like remind folks that the purpose of today’s call is to discuss our earnings results and strategic plan for the future we ask that you please keep your questions focused on these topics with that i’ll now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from mr jon hickman ladenburg thalmann jon hickman hi good afternoon could you elaborate a little bit on where the growth is coming from in this q i mean like you said best quarter you are looking forward to the best quarter in the company’s history and well above last year so what’s happening here rory o’connell yeah you know i think it’s just  the number of campaigns and the size of campaigns it’s really being driven by mobile media we’ve got a bunch of new clients we have improved and increased in auto and entertainment those two verticals are particularly hot at the moment but if i were to sort of summarize the answer i would say that the entire sales force is executing right now it really is across the country and i think they are focused on the goals they are staying in their lanes and they are delivering results jon hickman how many  what is the number of the sales force now rory o’connell yeah i guess we got about  we got about  sales people out in the field jon hickman and so you said in q you’ve already incurred another  plus in nonstandard professional fees is that the number i got  or something like that rory o’connell that’s right larry firestone that’s correct jon hickman could you  do you have any idea if it is going to be close to what you booked this quarter or do you think it will be somewhat less do you have any ideas that you can  larry firestone well there certainly won’t be as many components but it’ll be with our annual shareholders meeting on june  it will be weighted to the column of proxy defense so it’s going to  it will depend on how much energy we have to put towards that jon hickman so indulge me just a little bit in the proxy fight there’s these two other parties do you have any sense of what the end game there is like what do they want besides replacing your board rory o’connell jon i’ll make a couple of comments there you saw the record guidance that we just announced  jon hickman very impressive rory o’connell thank you we are executing on our plan to grow revenue and i fully believe the sito board is solely focused on creating shareholder value the transformation of this company over the last two years  the revenue growth over the last two years and our current momentum are testament of this the d filers are demanding an entirely new board and management team this is rare and unusual to replace the entire board at one time i believe is irresponsible and perhaps reckless further neither dissident shareholder group has yet to provide any credible alternative strategic plan or any viable proposals on how they would operate the business how they would drive long term shareholder value if they were to gain control of sito’s board look the company is now hitting its stride we are at a pivotal time and it is unfortunate that these two groups are seeking to take actions that have the potential to cause significant destruction and harm to the business that’s all i got jon thank you for the question jon hickman like i said the guidance is impressive good luck going forward and that’s it from me as far as questions go operator we have a question from mr mike malouf craig hallum eric des lauriers hi guys this is eric on for mike thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the improved media placement metrics with the increased number of campaigns and the size of campaigns it’s all looking good i just had a couple of questions regarding the new data products i know it’s early but what kind of feedback have you guys received from them thus far and what kind of activity in terms of customers picking them up and just looking for some feedback so far on what you guys have got rory o’connell eric you it’s still early i am not going to give you any numbers on that but we are really bullish on both we have a lot of interest we’ve got a lot of people who love these two products these two products are going to be successful i probably can’t be any more emphatic than that but we are confident that these two are going to make a difference eric des lauriers and when might we be able to expect to see some revenues from these new products do you guys have good visibility into that at this point rory o’connell yeah we have  we are booking some revenue now but i think you’ll start to see some real revenue late this year i think it’s something we can probably talk about in q as being something more than minimal eric des lauriers and then finally i don’t know if these two products came out or you guys announced them in somewhat short succession am i able to expect any more sort of data as a service product from you guys it seems like this is kind of covering a good spectrum of the data that you guys have so just wondering if there is anything else that we might be able to anticipate coming down the pipe rory o’connell nothing that i am prepared to announce on this call but good try i appreciate that look we are working hard on other stuff we have a great product development team here there is a feedback loop we listen to our customers we understand what they want and if we think it’s got real revenue opportunity we start to build it michael blanche our cto tells me all the time we can build anything we can build anything that’s what michael says and i take him at his word so when we find it to be of real value to our customers and real value to us we start building it operator we have a final question from tom champion cowen  company tom champion hi guys congrats on the strong april and the guidance it’s impressive i guess just two questions from me as the business appears to be kind of gaining momentum here how do you feel about your resourcing and ability to kind of handle the increasing number of campaigns and maybe campaign complexities i guess how do you feel like you are provisioned in terms of resources and what is hopefully sequential increase in revenues going forward through the year and then maybe a question for larry just any commentary on how maybe we should think about some of the operating expenses i think sales and marketing was a little higher than maybe we anticipated and you alluded to some investments and maybe some hired personnel costs just curious how we should think about linearity of sales and marketing and maybe does recurring operating expenses through the years thanks guys larry firestone you want to go first rory o’connell sure i will go first thanks for the question both larry and i have spent a long long time managing growth companies so it’s in our wheel house to get ahead of it with resources so that’s something that we are both really comfortable with and we’re planning for here we plan for growth we’ll hire for growth i think on the sales side there is excess capacity within the sales force we will be increasing all the sales guys’ plans and demands on them we’ve got a number of sales folks that we brought on within the last six months and as larry said it takes about six months before they start to really hit their stride we are really pleased with our sales force it’s a talented bunch and they too are hitting their stride right so we’ll have to build support we continue to build support around them on the production line here and the great team that manage campaigns and analyze performance and improve campaign performance so we have searches out on a number of jobs on the line so to speak but this is something that larry and i have done for a couple of decades so something we are quite capable of managing larry you want to take the second question larry firestone yes on the second side on the opex side we ramped up in the sales and marketing area and i think we’ve got as rory said we’ve got some excess capacity there so until the active selling side of the house actually gets up into the variable comp side i think you’ll see the sales and marketing area running in this kind of range obviously when or maybe it’s not obvious but when the revenues start to take off to higher levels that would be because we have built in a little bit more sales horsepower and variable comp is moving with that as well but i think you are pretty safe in the range that you are in with the q numbers taking that forward obviously with a little bit of perspective left on growth and revenues on the ga side probably in the same kind of ballpark as well i think we’ve got we probably have a little bit of ga to build in there as well going forward but that shouldn’t be a ton and then of course the interest expense as we get out towards q of next year it will be working its way down because it’s moving down a pretty good amortization trail right now end of qa operator this concludes today’s conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your

helpful  newest lingeria carnes well this is the rd go around and i can truly say that i am ready for new beginning my surgeon will be ruary oconnell from new orleansrn nov   callon droconnell is professionaldown to business and i felt very comfortable with him the office staff were friendly and had their routine down pat march   jean p   i met dr oconnell  some of the renew staff social worker nutritionist nurse practitioner at a support group meetingnew info meeting the st  min was for preops to ask questions to the postops then the postops went to their aftercare meeting and us preops stayed with the doctor  nurse  asked more questions it was very laid back  informal no slide show etc the doc was very honest  direct he  his partner dr mando do all of the surgeries together over  rny he openly stated that they consider themselves still learning the laproscopic procedure although i believe he said theyre done a few hundred they do the open rny in under  hour i had already decided that i wanted mine done open anyway and last week i found out i have gallstones and they only do an open procedure if they know the patient has stones he discussed the risks  expected outcomes i havent had an appointment with him yet but i feel ive made a good choice in surgeons i believe that experience competence and success rates are the most important factors in choosing a surgeon if a surgeon has a good bedside manner thats just a pluslap rny dr oconnell said my surgery was the easiest theyve done i took just  minutes i had no complications in the hospital went in on wednesday and home on friday weeks postop down    bmi is now  i couldnt have lost this weight without the surgery in less than a month my blood pressure was normal without medicationaftercare is very important there is a dietician  social worker  nurse practitioner in his office there are  support group meetings a month in different citiesi am very pleased that i choose the renew program and dr oconnell it was worth the fight with my insurance company feb   freddyt my first impression of dr oconnell is that he was not interested in having me as a patient he was somewhat drilling and pushy with some of the questions he asked me and i must admit when i left his office the first time i felt depressed but after the initial visit once he may have discovered that i was serious about the surgery he appearred to be much more forthright professional and at times had a pretty good sense of humor on the first visit his staff appearred to be busy occupiedand not friendly but as i went through the entire process i discovered that the staff was friendlysincere and very caring the professionalism they display was astounding the main thing i did not particularly like about him was how busy he would appear but i guess as doctor i have to understand that he had alot of other patients and some hustling and bustling is sometimes part of the jobto any patient considering him as a physician i would personally recomment him dro is clear about the risk of the surgery and he stongly emphasizes aftercare on a scale of  to  i would rate him a stong  the man saved my life and gave it back to me personally his surgical competence is better than his bedside manners  but overall dr ruary oconner is a very skilled physician is the weightloss field  nov   ragincajun he is very knowledgeable and amiable office staff is very informative and friendlythe only thing i dont like about him is his location because its several hours from my home also the waiting involved with appointments is quite long sometimesaftercare is stressed with followup appointments being imperative and support group meetings being recommendedyour are required to take a test on the surgical procedure before your surgery to ensure you know enough about the surgery nov   ginger w on my first visit to dr oconnells i was really nervous and unsure if i was doing the right thing after talking with some of his patients in the waiting room i knew that this was meant to be dr oconnell was very professional and took his time answering lots of questions his staff was very nice it took some repeat calling to push them to send for insurance approval but once they submitted it i was approved in  hours his support program after surgery is wonderful on every office visit you see a nutritionist and a social worker to discuss potential problems and address any questions you may have his office also has a group every month for gastric bypass patients which is mandatory for his patients i have been very pleased with oconnell and have recommended him to several of my friends july   kharson before i met dr oconnell i felt totally committed to choosing him as my surgeon my dear friend and endocrinologist highly recommended him and that was all i neededend of discussionmy first impression wow hes so human nice warm caring friendly he just took his time and was laid back with me now dont get me wrong his staff were like machines methodical and structured everything happens in sequence and to prefect standards i felt totally taken care of they know there job this field and are highly professional and impeccibleaftercare is a strict requirement i admired that the most he and his whole staff come to my city once a month for appt visits and then hold the aftercare program that evening his dietician social worker and nurse practitioner man the meetings youre expected to attend for  yrs june   kim p i have not met with dr oconnell yet i have talked to several patients of his and he has an excellent reputation april   elaine b he is very down to earth in his manner and kind to the needs of the obese patient my impression over time has only gotten better he knows what he is doing and his record proves thishis staff is great and always there when you need them very accessiblei couldnt find a single thing to dislike about him very professional and caring at the same timeaftercare is very much encouraged group meetings encouraged dietician on callthe risks were not under played we are made very well aware of the risksi rate dr oconnell a he has the perfect combination of bedside manner and competence he takes time when you want to talk and also answers the phone sometimes that floored me april   jean p   i met dr oconnell  some of the renew staff social

fundamental laws of three liberal democratic states  canada ireland and italy  and the role played by the highest judicial authorities of those states in interpreting the law the interpretations given are significant for the states and frequently involve unexpected interpretations of the law the author addresses the interrelation between constitutional interpretation and political morality referring both to the work of constitutional judges and to the work of theoretical writers he argues that constitutional judges in the task of constitutional interpretation try to reconstruct the legal materials before them to provide the most acceptable reconstruction of the legal system from the viewpoint of political morality in doing this they rely on legalized criteria of political morality to judge the correctness of the interpretation their reconstruction is a contribution to the public debate on the legitimacy of the legal ordergeneralcondition hpb condition ratingsnew item
