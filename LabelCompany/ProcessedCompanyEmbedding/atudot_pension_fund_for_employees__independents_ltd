these plans have multiple classifications based on the plan structure and benefitsthese plans can be further divideded  deferred annuity  immediate annuity annuity certain with cover and without cover pension plans guaranteed period annuity life annuity national pension scheme nps pension funds deferred annuity a deferred pension scheme allows you to accumulate a corpus through regular premiums or single premium over a policy term after the policy term is over the pension will begin the advantages of deferred pension plans are immense and these include tax benefits that are associated with this pension scheme no tax is levied on the money that an individual invests in the plan unless he withdraws it as deferred pension scheme can be bought by making the onetime payment or by making regular contributions towards it therefore the plan suits to all types of investors those who want to invest systematically and those who have a chunk of money to invest immediate annuity in an immediate annuity scheme pension begins immediately one has to deposit a lumpsum amount and pension will start instantlybasedon the lumpsum amountinvested by the policyholder a range of the annuity options is available to choose frommoreover the premiums paid are exempted for tax as per income tax act after the death of a policyholder his nominee will be entitled to get money with cover and without cover pension plansthe with cover pension plans have life cover component in the plan this implies that on the death of the policyholder a lump sum amount is paid to the family members however the cover amount is not very high since a large part of premium is diverted towards growing the corpus rather than covering for life risk the without cover pension plan implies that there is no life cover in the event of unfortunate death of the policyholder the nominee will get the corpus till the date of the death currently deferred pension plans are with cover and immediate annuity plans are without cover annuity certainas per this clause the annuity is paid to the annuitant for a specific number of years the annuitant can choose the period and if he dies before exhausting all payments the annuity will be paid to the beneficiary guaranteed period annuityas per this annuity option annuity is given to the life assured for certain periods like  or  years whether or not he survives that duration life annuityas per this annuity option pension amount will be paid to the annuitant until death after choosing the “with spouse” option the amount of pension will be given to the spouse of the policyholder in case of the death of the annuitant national pension scheme npsnew pension scheme has been introduced by the government for people looking to build up pension amount you can put savings in the new pension scheme which will be invested in equity and debt market as per your preference you can withdraw  of the amount at retirement and rest  must be used to purchase the annuity the maturity amount is not taxfree pension fundsin a way investing in a pension plan is a good option indeed as these plans remain in force for a long time they offer comparatively better returns at maturity pension fund regulatory and development authority pfrda the government body has allowed  companies as fund managers  question and answer on pension plans what are the features of pension plans nowadays people start planning for the retirement life at an early stage so that at a later stage they do not have to depend on others to make their ends meet usually a conventional retirement plan encompasses following features annuity the annuity is the most distinctive feature of pension plans and generally comes in two types immediate and deferred as its name suggests immediate annuity starts immediately the insurance company pays the annuitant the annuity pension plan amount right after the receipt of the lump sum premium these plans offer the single premium route so that the insurance company can use the amount invested by the annuitant to build up a corpus for him or her the deferred annuity plans are the normal plans that start paying a certain sum after a few years the insurance companies offer a diverse range of pension plans for various terms that allow the annuitant to choose the period for which they want to receive the annuity if you are thinking of retirement planning then look for the best retirement plan in india by looking at the annuity they offer visavis the premium you will pay sum assured the sum assured is the life insurance cover that the insured receives during the tenure of the pension plan it gives the insured the benefit of being able to provide for his dependents if the worst comes to pass the sum assured is generally given as a part of the ‘with cover’ pension plans such type of retirement pension plans give the mental peace necessary to carry on life without any worries the life insurance companies in india calculate the sum assured in different ways for instance a few of them may offer pension plans with sum assured of say  times the premium amount while others may provide a sum assured that equals the fund value of the policy taken by the individual the calculation varies from company to company in case there is no sum assured then the plan is more in the nature of pure play pension plan rather than an insurance plan with retirement benefits vesting age the vesting age is the age when the investor starts receiving the pension income depending on when the policy was brought and the type of premium the vesting age can be your current age if you opt for the pension plan payment to start right away immediate annuity – lump sum premium or after a few years such as  years the minimum vesting age for most policies start from  years of age but on an average is around  years the maximum vesting age is generally around  years though some insurance companies may offer plans that have a maximum vesting age of  years or even  years or more accumulation period this refers to the period when the premium is being paid by the investor for the pension plans some of the best pension plans in india offer the option to the investor to start paying off a part of the premium from any amounts due to be received by them this decreases the outgo for the investor during the years leading up to retirement and helps them use their money on more urgent matters however most pension plans keep the accumulation period separate from the payout period this helps in building up a significant corpus for the investor to receive a pension payment period the payment period as the name suggests refers to the period in which the investor starts receiving the payments this period is generally separate from the accumulation phase and helps the investor to increase his overall retirement corpus surrender value the surrender value of pension plans is the amount the insurance company will pay the individual if they opt to surrender the retirement plan before its due date and if they have paid the premium for the required minimum period though people may need to surrender a plan for various reasons including not being able to continue with the premium payment or needing the money most experts suggest not surrendering a retirement plan due to the loss the individual will face when the insured party chooses to surrender a retirement plan they lose all benefits attached to the plan including the life cover if any readers must note that the surrender value is a term associated only with insurance plans that have a savings corpus creation feature the plans that do not have a savings component such as term plans do not have a surrender value  minimum guarantee of pension plans every pension plan needs to have a minimum guarantee each premium paid towards the insurance policy as well as the maturity benefits must have “on zero returns” as instructed by irda this should be no less than one percent of the premiums paid over the yearsthough the minimum guarantee extends to all variable insurance plans most of the companies offer various types of other pension plans that may offer better returns than the guaranteed plans this of course varies from plan to plan and you should make sure that you pick ones that makes sense to you what the minimum guarantee of pension plans offers you is awareness of the amount that you will definitely receive at the end of the policy period what is participating and nonparticipating pension plan the participating pension plans are also called the traditional type of insurance plans since the bonus in these products are similar to the reversionary bonuses of the standard insurance policies in traditional plans the insurance company offers the insured a bonus that is a percentage of the sum assured of their policy this bonus is generally declared by the insurance company each year based on its performance in the previous year the reversionary bonus is generally of the nature of simple interest where the bonus of the previous period does not get added to the sum assured these bonuses declared in the tenure of the retirement policy get accumulated and the lump sum amount distributed to the insured party when the policy matures the participating pension scheme in india allows for a planned approach to retirement planning the nonparticipating plans declare their bonus amounts at the time of the investor signing up for the plan the insurance company has no discretion in nonparticipating pension plans and have to deliver on the amounts promised under the pension plan most of the best pension plans in india offer retirement benefits or bonuses that are pegged to certain indices these may be the larger market index or smaller indices comprising of a few securities or government bonds the nonparticipating plans offer more definite returns and make it easier for people to do their retirement planning what is public provident fund

you to create wealth for future but also offers comprehensive life coverage at the same time these plans are essentially of two types unit linked insurance plans or ulips that provides returns based on market performance and traditional endowment plans that offer a lump sum or annuity payout at the end of the policy term when the life insurance policy matures these type of saving scheme or investments offer life coverage and returns but differ in their construct a good financial plan with returns and life coverage invest the premium as paid by the policyholder in the stock market and gives them returns which are comparatively volatile as they depend on the performance of the stock markets whereas an endowment plan offers lower but safer returns however a customer does not get to know where they are saving money or it is being further used due to the opaque construct of endowment plans unlike ulips where they know where their fund is being put ulips offer customers the option to check the status of their investments through a figure called the net asset value nav among others nonetheless endowment plans have their benefits where ulips give the policyholder a lot more

future objective in mind and this objective could be either a longterm or a shortterm objective like buying a house childs marriage and education or just building up a corpus for future the best investment acts as a twoinone solution unit linked investment plans ulips unit linked plans as commonly referred to are a type of coverage plan that provides coverage wherein the money paid as premium by the investor is channelised into the stock markets each and every ulip has a different set of funds that they invest in individuals who invest in a best investment plan get a certain number of units of the fund these investments are based on the correlation of the fund value of the fund they are investing in and the premium the investors have put inthe unit linked insurance plans are amongst the best investment options in india in case you are looking for some coverage cum investment options the ulip plans give both financial security and life coverage ulips also give you the leverage to make direct market investments your ulips funds can be invested into equity funds or debt funds or both partially the value of the debt fund or the equity fund is evaluated as net asset value the criteria though investment through ulips is rarely seen case but unit linked plans have a greatly responsible in the investment market comparatively mutual funds are complete systematic investment products ie sip different mutual funds have different risk exposures mutual funds that are equity oriented invest a major part into equities wherein the balanced funds or hybrid funds invest into equity and debt fund market the debt funds invest in the bonds and fixed income securities below is a brief on how ulips and mutual funds justify your investment needs potential of returns the potential returns on ulips are lower since the ulips fall is a member of low risk products unlike a mutual fund product the sum assured promised by the product is regardless of the return earned by the ulip plan wherein mutual funds are differently featured as the equity mutual funds incur better returns than the hybrid returns and the hybrid funds give higher returns than the debt funds liquidity ulips can be anytime used for money withdrawal to get through any financial emergency this totally depends on the investment tenure of the product although mutual funds are more liquid as the market exposure is higher than ulips risk exposure since ulip plans are less prone to risks because the simple ideas of ulips are to provide coverage although ulip plans have a variety of scope to invest its funds the ulips needs to be handled diligently since they are basically insurance products the risk associated with equity mutual funds are more than hybrid mutual funds and both are relatively more risky than a debt fund although an investor can put in their money after making a detailed study on the product nav ie the net asset valueendowment plans endowment plans are the traditional form of insurance products that offer an individual a life cover with very low profit endowment plans are usually taken by individuals who are looking to increase the value of fund plan but one which offers them guaranteed profits in lieu of a higher life coverendowment plans are the best investment plan for investors who are not looking for a large corpus but are actually more concerned about keeping their funds safe and secure and still receive a certain amount of profits on their assetsguaranteed return plan these plans offer a guaranteed amount of fund to a policyholder at the end of a specific investment policy term the policyholder needs to compare and know that the guarantee he gets here is specific to set of terms and conditions of the plan these conditions could be either a highest nav which is usually in unit linked plan capital guarantee again offered by unit linked plan maturity guarantee offered by traditional endowment plan objectives of investment plans

investments with coverage provides the dual benefit of life cover and returns this means that in the event of anything unfortunate happening to the insured their family will receive the sum for which they were insured in addition to the fund value either as a single or in the form of monthlyquarterlyhalf yearly payments they help to secure the family needs and monetary goals if the insured party is unable to earn a living or in the unfortunate event of his demise goal based planning a goal based saving option is a great way for saving money for a goal – whether it is buying a house or a car paying for children’s education costs or planning for marriage or after you retire the endowment funds offer a secure yet safe way to plan for retirement if you are not keen on riskier market linked ulip plans the ulip plans offer alternative opportunities to invest and you can take a look at their historical profits to calculate your returns and corpus build up in a few years time also the lockin period of a good plan to invest and save that the funds stay untouched and builds up over the years to help you achieve your objectives build fund reservoir plans with coverage cum investments with lock in period help to save money that can be used to fulfill a financial goal whether you want to buy your first house in seven years andor save enough to buy a second home in the next five your saving plan feature can help accomplish your aims tax benefits the premiums paid under these plans qualify for deduction under section c of tax act up to applicable limits this means that you are not taxed on the funds you invest in these options or best saving schemes and additionally the profit is reduced by the investing fund the exemption however is limited to the total exemption limit under section c and cannot exceed that statutory limit in addition the payout received on maturity is exempted from levies under section d of the act options to obtain a loan in lieu of the same as a guarantee against nonpayment banking institutions take these plans as collateral for any loans given to the insured these instruments act as security for the loan since the loan is in the form of a secured loan the interest rate is generally lower and other terms and conditions more favorable as compared to unsecured loans q  a on investment planning what personal things to check before choosing plans goals your monetary goals should determine what type of scheme you should buy these goals may include marriage buying a house or a car providing for children’s education and marriage or building a corpus amount in fact even small term goals like foreign trips can be financed by ulips if you are just starting out in your career or have a small family then you can definitely opt for a best saving scheme such as a ulip to fund your shortterm goals on the other hand if you are in your s or even s then endowment plans are better as best saving schemes in combination with ulips or other options like mutual fund your monetary goals will help determine what options are best current expenses vs savings in order to meet the financial goals the amount an investor spends or saves has a larger role to play with fewer saving and more expenses it is unlikely that you can define large shortterm goals that can be met by coverage plans in such a scenario if you live at home with your parents and have no major outgo like rent and you are likely to save money every month then it is best to buy an adequate life cover with return benefits and get their twoinone benefit future expenses vs savings the amount you save for future will also determine what kind of scheme works as the best for you if you have fewer expenses now because the children are young you can plan for the major expenses that will come your way in a few years like the children’s college education or marriage therefore you can choose an option that charges premium for a few years and then pays out enough that it can itself pay for any premium from the annuity or other regular benefits moreover you investing a higher amount would now mean that a good profit plan will grow to a larger capital base in  years time when you need it for your monetary goals or basic expenses planning your expenses is a good way to filter the ones to invest on major expenses that may arise these schemes are a smart way to get the cover you need and also grow your fund at the same time through the best saving schemes the major expenses like buying a house or to meet the living expenses after you retire can be easily covered by ulips and even endowments also you can plan for the major expenses that are certain to occur and take them into account while determining the best saving scheme eg suppose your child is in primary school then you know that within  years you will have to bear major expenses for their education as such it makes sense to invest a small ulip that ensures you can meet this definite expense in a few years time insurance cover – existing vs required the insurance cover of the best saving scheme should be adequate to take care of you or your family in case you are unable to work anymore or in the unfortunate event of you being no more the cover provided by the product should be able to pay for your own or your family’s expenses in the years to come until your children can take care of you and your spouse in addition to themselves to understand how much you need make an estimate of your current and future expenses visavis what a scheme offers if your cover is less than what is required then opting for ulips or endowments as best saving schemes are a better way to ensure you increase your money while protecting yourself and your family at the same time number of dependents the number of dependents should also determine the assured sum you need to invest in the best options if you have only a wife and child as dependents then your needs would be lesser in comparison to when you may be taking care of your siblings parents parentsinlaw grandparents nephews nieces etc your monetary insurance product should not only be able to cover for all the necessary expenses and also help you build a corpus for all your and your family’s major goals also the age of the younger dependents matter while choosing the best saving scheme if you have teenage children then it is likely you need a good plan to save up for their college education or marriage ulips are better for such cases than endowment plans fund planning before making investments to understand how much cover a person needs in a best saving scheme he or she has to take stock of their existing expenses compute to the extent possible the amount of future obligations that are likely to crop up and how much money they need to meet their living expenses a key factor is also the age of dependents as this would determine how long before they can meet their own living expenses without having to depend on the payouts from the schemes existing debts the existing loans that a person has are one of the primary things that one should consider while calculating the amount of life cover required in the best saving scheme the existing loan may be a house loan or a personal loan a car loan etc it may also include loans that a person or hisher dependents may have to take in the future and their emi payments eg a child may have to take an education loan to cover for further studies or foreign studies in such cases an ideal financial portfolio should be adequate to cover for repayment of these loans for  or more years until the child lands a job and can repay the loan himself or herself replacement of earnings this is perhaps the most important aspect of applying for a best saving scheme in the first place the payment from the best plan on the happening of an unforeseen or unfortunate event must be adequate to cover for the loss of income without any material change in one’s lifestyle suppose the sole breadwinner has a salary of rs  lakh per annum then the plan should be able to cover for a substantial part if not all of the income loss suffered by the family if the insured is unable to work due to a partial or total disability or in the unfortunate event of his demise saving money also helps to build up a corpus that can yield interest income existing and future expenses a good product should be enough to cover any major expenses at present or in the near or distant future so larger expenses such marriage retirement continuing treatment of illnesses etc has to be accounted for in the calculations along with saving fund while arriving at the life cover required for the family the expenses should be thought out with some rationality to select the best saving scheme considering medical expenses or hospital stay for the family does not make sense if there is already a mediclaim plan covering all such expenses however the annual premiums on such options should be factored in while making the calculations existing cover the existing cover should be discounted while calculating the cover required if it is an individual financial scheme if it is the employer’s group policy then the coverage under it can be considered for more clarity it is always better to ask the employer for the benefits under the group financial policy once the facts are clear the individual can reduce the amount they are likely to receive under these policies from the new cover they need under the insurance products income of spouse or other members of family while calculating the coverage required it makes sense to discount the income of the spouse or other members of the family this will help provide a more realistic picture of the amount of coverage and returns required if the spouse earns then the amount of cover should be able to take care of all the major expenses that are likely to occur and also take care of most of the expenses that are being met by the earnings of the insured the rest of the expenses can be met from the income of the spouse premium calculation to plan your financial future better insurance service providers have developed various tools to aid individuals to calculate premiums and plan better for their future financial aims a premium calculator helps to make a cost efficient decision and examine different plans that meet the basic requirement of the investors the calculator helps the investor to use their fund in a more systematic manner in order to have a good portfolio what are the things you must compare before planning for investments there are different options to invest and not necessarily all of them can fulfill the basic objective of an investor to invest to know more about this it is always good to compare before you can purchase when we are comparing we need to look at a few things cover the coverage that is offered is a good indication of which products are better as compared to the others the better scheme will always offer the most comprehensive and yet practical coverage though most of the schemes offer similar options to save some of them may offer increased cover if the ulips reach a certain milestone or may offer the same cover at a lower premium also with the irda keeping a strict vigil on the insurance market most insurance providers now focus on ulips as longterm products unlike before when they were mostly sold by unscrupulous agents as shortterm options to invest this means that companies now are more likely to offer better cover than before as the investors are buying the policy for the longer tenure instead of looking at it like a shortterm plan addon covers and riders a good financial product offers extra covers and riders at significant discounts these addon riders may include increased life cover for a smaller premium additions cover for parents or larger number of family members health cover timely health checkups and so on these rider addons though not always a feasible option may offer the specific cover that a person may be seeking for instance some riders may include personal accident cover and child cover among others all of these are available at a discount as compared to what taking one of them as a single unit plan may come up to in terms of premiums an investor can opt for the addon covers or riders that suit their needs flexibility to change cover some options allow the insured individual to increase or even decrease their cover during the policy tenure this is essential as the cover needs vary according to your age and responsibilities during your early years the cover can be less but it has to increase as your expenditure and responsibilities grow with age this is because the investing amount should be able to cover for any loss of income without the need to make any major changes to your lifestyle a good plan will let you increase or decrease your cover according to your needs insurance premium though most of premiums of the assured amount are similar extra fees and charges may affect the benefits on the investing funds endowments as a rule are costlier than ulips due to the guaranteed profits they offer some things to look out for include what part of the premium is used for investing some ulips may load more of their costs during their initial years while others may spread them over a few years this means that the sum allocated to the ulip is less in the initial years this affects the returns as higher the initial investments the higher the longterm benefits option to increase or decrease premium a good plan will offer the option to increase or decrease your premium depending on your payment capabilities some may offer top up covers that let you increase your cover on payment of extra premiums this is a good option to have as you may want to pay a higher premium to gain higher profits when you can and then reduce your premium when you have other responsibilities where you need to put your fund returns in most cases the profits offered are a good way to understand which option is better for one thing there are two types the market linked ulips whose benefits are dependent on the market and may offer higher profits and the endowment options that offer sure profits but on the lower side another point to note is that the profits in endowment choices only come after a few years while in the case of ulips the insured can make complete withdrawals once the lock in period has expired a good way to understand which plan is better is to understand your requirements if you prefer sure but safe profits then endowment options are ideal alternatively if you are comfortable with the higher risk for the higher profit then the ulips are best for your needs type of payouts different savings options offer different types of returns for instance some may offer a single payment while others may offer an annuity while others may offer a bit of both the choice of returns will depend on a few things – the goal for which the fund is put into the product is being made the time for which the fund is invested will be made the type of return desired etc in case the scheme is being chosen for a specific goal such as child’s education or a dream house or retirement then the type of profits desired will vary for instance in case of child plans it will be better to receive annuities over a few years that will cover graduate and postgraduate costs whether in india or abroad for retirement it is better to receive a single payment near retirement to cover any relocation or other costs and then receive monthly payouts that serve as regularized monthly returns what option of payouts you choose will depend on your expectations of your needs fund options available ulips invest into funds that are linked to various units – whether trading on the market of otherwise for instance some ulips may offer near guaranteed profits that are on the lower side as compared to marketlinked funds that offer riskier but higher returns the lower near guaranteed ulips invest in nonrisky debt securities and savings options and are thus able to protect your capital from market volatility most companies offer choice of fund that may sometimes depend on your age bracket some may offer a choice of debt and equity market fund with an equal proportion of your funds  invested in each type of fund units or slightly skewed in favor of debt or equity say  most experts suggest taking a higher exposure to fund market at a younger age and then slowly moving to debt as you age so that by the time you retire all your money is in debt funds such a strategy works better as you are exposed to the market risks at a younger age when you can recover from any downswing and this risk decreases with age as your responsibilities increase moreover the corpus you have built up remains safe from the vagaries of the market consequently the funds available are an important thing to check before making your choice flexibility to change insurance companies allow the insured party to change the amount of their funds for investing into the funds of their choice this is especially good as the of savings increase over the years and investors have the option to considerably grow their asset base the increase in the investing amount is generally accompanied by a corresponding increase in the life cover though the increase in the cover may not be proportional as the focus is more on the growth of fund alternative investment and insurance options an important thing to check and decide if you should invest in a good financial product this works well if you already have some sort of cover gives coverage or a term plan in such cases investors can use their funds for investing into mutual funds which even though they may not provide coverage are likely to offer better returns however if you do not have a choice for investing into market and are looking for policies that gives returns and coverage then are the best options for you to put your money into you can use an endowment schemes as a backup for definite profits and ulips for other goals such as a house car retirement foreign travel and child’s education among others insurance premium payment options most funds give you the option to make monthly quarterly half yearly or annual payments in certain instances the quarterly half yearly or annual options make sense as the payment outgo may be less since the companies may offer a discount due to the lesser paperwork involved however the premium are generally high and as such only makes sense when you have enough funds to pay the premiums due if you are starting out on your career or do not have the necessary schemes to make a single premium payment then the monthly payments make better sense there are products that have the option to change the periodicity of the premium payment for certain policies you can begin with the monthly or quarterly payment options at the policy inception and then switch to the semiannual or yearly payments in the later years tax benefits the premiums of these policies are exempted under the tax act up to the prescribed limits this means that when you make any premium payment for the policies you have you can claim deduction of the amount thus advanced from your total earnings for instance suppose you are investing rs  annually in life coverage options from your annual income of rs  lakh in this case while calculating your income tax you can deduct rs  under section c of the indian tax act only the remaining amount rs  lakh will be liable to taxation provided there are no other exemptions available the payout from these policies qualifies for exemption under section d of the income tax act types of investments while planning for children the planning for children can be further subdivided into two the first for the children’s education and the second for their marriage both education and marriage are major expenses and need proper asset planning insurance investment options are ideal for these as they provide the child the necessary covers in addition to helping the parent prepare for the eventual expenses investments children’s education the meet the expenses to educate your child start taking gargantuan proportions after secondary education from taking tuition classes to studying for competitive exams all preparations for furthering their education and career prospects are expensive and need a good financial portfolio in addition college fees in private colleges and foreign universities are quite exorbitant and will only increase gradually all these expenses cannot be met out of the monthly salary of the parents and need to be properly planned these are ideal for such cases as they provide the necessary cover for the child and also help the parent buildup a corpus for major expenses some things to check out while choosing a plan for children’s educational expenses include whether the payout is lump sum or regular timely payouts are better to pay the tuition and college fees while a single payment is best to meet major expenses that crop up at the beginning of college or a foreign education course some offer both options with a single payment when the child reaches a certain age like  or  years and customary payouts whether the cover insures against children specific problems children have their own set of unique ailments and the better option will cover such contingencies they will also provide reimbursement for illnesses and diseases that require hospital stays possibility of increasing or decreasing cover since the parents meet most of their children’s expenses it makes sense to go for a good scheme to invest with higher return in the initial years and lesser cover this will also help to build up a larger corpus in the later years investments for children’s marriage the individuals generally sketch the funds to invest in order to meet the expenses of children’s marriage with a good financial option the best ones are those that give a payout at a certain age of the child such as  or  years an early move in to the products that provide coverage when the child is young helps to build a large corpus of premium what are the best options while planning for retirement the ideal move for retirement is to begin at a young age this can help build up a considerable corpus by the time the investorinsured person retires a good retirement option is one that provides a lump sum payout at the retirement age or just before to meet the relocation expenses from the place where the person is working to his hometown and regular payments thereafter that serve as monthly earnings for the individual the insurance providers offer a range of annuity or periodic payout options that the persons can choose from based on their needs the schemes chosen should depend on the age of the insured person though equitylinked ulips offer the best returns they are not ideal for people above a certain age due to their higher risk profile people in their s or early s can opt for an option to invest with a focus on the equities but those in their s or s should gradually move away from equities and stick to conservative debt funds an early move helps to build a significant corpus by the time the person retires the best strategy is to begin early have a stock market oriented investment in the s and early s and gradually move towards a debtfocused portfolio with age some insurance providers provide the option to do this automatically with the person’s full awareness while others provide the insured individual to manage the allocation themselves through the plan most providers do not allow individuals beyond a certain age to opt for aggressive funds for the investing scheme and instead gives them a perfect blend of growth and capital preservation most retirement schemes offer the insured the option to make a single premium payment each year or opt for regularised payments the choice between the two should depend on the convenience of the insured person his ability to pay and the discount provided in the lump sum amount insurance providers offer the option to change the periodicity of the premiums depending on the insured’s convenience they also offer additional options to increase the policy amount change the fund mix or increase the cover through topups or otherwise what is the classification of investment options the investments can be classified according to the type of schemes they provide the duration in which the premium needs to be paid and the life stage of the investor insured person guaranteed or nonguaranteed the guaranteed insurance products offer lower but secure profits these are an ideal if the investor is looking for safeguarding their assets and looking for stable growth of their money most of the guaranteed plans invest the insured party’s money in secure instruments that are definite to provide the necessary benefits the nonguarantee insurance products offer better profits but do not promise definite profits as they are market linked the funds that are put in can range from aggressive funds that invest in equity growth stocks and focus on capital appreciation to conservative funds that invest in debt moneymarket instruments or bank deposits and focus on capital preservation single premium or regular premium the single premium offers a lower premium as the paperwork and other administrative charges are less however from the insured’s perspective these options make sense only if they can afford to pay the cost regular premiums are better for younger people who are just began with their careers and do not have much savings life stage or non life stage the life stage and non life stage options allocate assets according to the investor’s age those in their s or s are given adequate stock market exposure as they can better manage the risk for people in their s or s the fund allocation shifts to lessriskier stocks and instruments that provide stable and secure profits the financial options for people in their s or s focus on gradual asset growth and

that requires an employer to make contributions into a pool of funds set aside for a workers future benefit the pool of funds is invested on the employees behalf and the earnings on the investments generate income to the worker upon retirement in addition to an employers required contributions some pension plans have a voluntary investment component a pension plan may allow a worker to contribute part of his current income from wages into an investment plan to help fund retirement the employer may also match a portion of the worker’s annual contributions up to a specific percentage or dollar amount   breaking down pension plan there are two main types of pension plans in a definedbenefit plan the employer guarantees that the employee receives a definite amount of benefit upon retirement regardless of the performance of the underlying investment pool the employer is liable for a specific flow of pension payments to the retiree the dollar amount is determined by a formula usually based on earnings and years of service and if the assets in the pension plan are not sufficient to pay the benefits the company is liable for the remainder of the payment american employersponsored pension plans date from the s and at their height in the s they covered nearly half of all private sector workers about  of public employees and roughly  of private employees in the us are covered by a definedbenefit plan today in a definedcontribution plan the employer makes specific plan contributions for the worker usually matching to varying degrees the contributions made by the employees the final benefit received by the employee depends on the plans investment performance the company’s liability to pay a specific benefit ends when the contributions are made because this is much less expensive than the traditional pension when the company is on the hook for whatever the fund cant generate a growing number of private companies are moving to this type of plan and ending definedbenefit plans the bestknown definedcontribution plan is the k and its equivalent for nonprofits workers the b in common parlance pension plan often means the more traditional definedbenefit plan with a set payout funded and controlled entirely by the employer some companies offer both types of plans they even allow employees to roll over k balances into their definedbenefit plans there is another variation the payasyougo pension plan set up by the employer these tend to be wholly funded by the employee who can opt for salary deductions or lump sum contributions which are generally not permitted on k plans otherwise they similarly to k plans except that they usually offer no company match  factoring in erisa the employee retirement income security act of  erisa is a federal law designed to protect the retirement assets of investors and the law specifically provides guidelines that retirement plan fiduciaries must follow to protect the assets of private sector employees companies that provide retirement plans are referred to as plan sponsors fiduciaries and erisa requires each company to provide a specific level of plan information to employees who are eligible plan sponsors provide details on investment options and the dollar amount of worker contributions that are matched by the company if applicable employees also need to understand vesting which refers to the dollar amount of the pension assets that are owned by the worker vesting is based on the number of years of service and other factors vesting enrollment in a definedbenefit plan is usually automatic within one year of employment although vesting can either be immediate or spread out over seven years limited benefits are provided and leaving a company before retirement may result in losing some or all of an employee’s pension benefits with definedcontribution plans your individual contributions are  vested as soon as they reach your account but if your employer matches those contributions or gives you company stock as part of your benefits package it may set up a schedule under which a certain percentage is handed over to you each year until you are fully vested just because retirement contributions are fully vested doesn’t mean you’re allowed to make withdrawals however   are pension plans taxable most employersponsored pension plans are qualified meaning they meet internal revenue code and employee retirement income security act of  erisa requirements that gives them their taxadvantaged status employers get a tax break on the contributions they make to the plan for their employees so do employees contributions they make to the plan come off the top of their paychecks – that is are taken out of their gross income that effectively reduces their taxable income and in turn the amount they owe the irs come april  funds placed in a retirement account then grow at a taxdeferred rate meaning no tax is due on them as long as they remain in the account both types of plans allow the worker to defer tax on the retirement plan’s earnings until withdrawals begin and this tax treatment allows the employee to reinvest dividend income interest income and capital gains which generates a much higher rate of return before retirement upon retirement when you start receiving funds from a qualified pension plan you may have to pay federal and state income taxes if you have no investment in the plan because you have not contributed anything or are considered to not have contributed anything your employer did not withhold contributions from your salary or you have received all of your contributions investments in the contract tax free in previous years your pension is fully taxable if you contributed money after tax was paid your pension or annuity is only partially taxable you dont owe tax on the part of the payment you made that represents the return of the aftertax amount you put into the plan partially taxable qualified pensions are taxed under the simplified method can companies change their pension plans some companies are keeping their traditional definedbenefit plans but are freezing their benefits meaning that after a certain point workers will no longer accrue greater payments no matter how long they work for the company or how large their salary grows   when a pension plan provider decides to implement or modify the plan the covered employees almost always receive a credit for any qualifying work performed prior to the change the extent to which past work is covered varies from plan to plan when applied in this way the plan provider must cover this cost retroactively for each employee in a fair and equal way over the course of his or her remaining service years what is a pension fund when a definedbenefit plan is made up of pooled contributions from employers unions or other organizations it is commonly referred to as a pension fund run by a financial intermediary and managed by professional fund managers on behalf of a company and its employees pension funds control relatively large amounts of capital and represent the largest institutional investors in many nations their actions can dominate the stock markets in which they are invested  pension funds are typically exempt from capital gains tax earnings on their investment portfolios are tax deferred or tax exempt advantages and disadvantages of a pension fund a pension fund provides a fixed preset benefit for employees upon retirement helping workers plan their future spending the employer makes the most contributions and cannot retroactively decrease pension fund benefits voluntary employee contributions may be allowed as well since benefits do not depend on asset returns benefits remain stable in a changing economic climate businesses can contribute more money to a pension fund and deduct more from their taxes than with a definedcontribution plan a pension fund helps subsidize early retirement for promoting specific business strategies however a pension plan is more complex and costly to establish and maintain than other retirement plans employees have no control over investment decisions in addition an excise tax applies if the minimum contribution requirement is not satisfied or if excess contributions are made to the plan an employee’s payout depends on his salary and length of employment with the company no loans or early withdrawals are available from a pension fund inservice distributions are not allowed to a participant before age  taking early retirement generally results in a smaller monthly payout monthly annuity or lump sum which is better with a definedbenefit plan you usually have two choices when it comes to distribution periodic usually monthly payments for the rest of your life or a lump sum distribution some plans allow you to do both ie take out some of the money in a lump sum and use the rest to generate periodic payments in any case there will likely be a deadline by which you have to decide and your decision will be final there are several things to consider when choosing between a monthly annuity and a lump sum   annuity monthly annuity payments are typically offered as a single life annuity for you only for the rest of your life – or as a joint and survivor annuity for you and your spouse the latter pays a lesser amount each month typically  less but the payouts continue after your death until the surviving spouse passes away some people decide to take the single life annuity opting to purchase a whole life or other type of life insurance policy to provide income for the surviving spouse when the employee dies the pension payout stops however the spouse then receives a large death benefit payout taxfree which can be invested and uses to replace the taxable pension payout that has ceased this strategy which goes by the fancysounding name pension maximization may not be a bad idea if the cost of the insurance is less than the difference between the single life and joint and survivor payouts in many cases however the cost far outweighs the benefit can your pension fund ever run out of money theoretically yes but if your pension fund doesn’t have enough money to pay you what it owes you the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc could pay a portion of your monthly annuity up to a legally defined limit for  the annual maximum pbgc benefit for a yearold retiree is  of course pbgc payments may not be as much as you would have received from your original pension plan   annuities usually pay out at a fixed rate they may or may not include inflation protection if not the amount you get is set from retirement on this can reduce the real value of your payments each year depending on how the cost of living is going and since it rarely is going down many retirees prefer to take their money in a lump sum       lump sum if you take a lump sum you avoid the potential if unlikely problem of your pension plan going broke or losing some or all of your pension if the company files for bankruptcy  plus you can invest the money keeping it working for you – and possibly earning a better interest rate too if there is money left when you die you can pass it along as part of your estate on the downside no guaranteed lifetime income as with an annuity it’s up to you to make the money last and unless you roll the lump sum into an ira or other taxsheltered account the whole amount will be immediately taxed and could push you into a higher tax bracket if your definedbenefit plan is with a publicsector employer your lump sum distribution may only be equal to your contributions with a private sector employer the lump sum is usually the present value of the annuity or more precisely the total of your expected lifetime annuity payments discounted to todays dollars  of course you can always use a lump sum distribution to purchase an immediate annuity on your own which could provide a monthly income stream including inflation protection as an individual purchaser however your income stream will probably not be as large as it would with an annuity from your original definedbenefit pension fund   which yields more money with just a few assumptions and a small amount of math you can determine which choice yields the largest cash payout you know the present value of a lumpsum payment of course but in order to figure out which makes better financial sense you need to estimate the present value of annuity payments to figure out the discount or future expected interest rate for the annuity payments think about how you might invest the lump sum payment and then use that interest rate to discount back the annuity payments a reasonable approach to selecting the ‘discount rate’ would be to assume that the lump sum recipient invests the payout in a diversified investment portfolio of  equity investments and  bond investments using historical averages of  for stocks and  for bonds the discount rate would be  imagine that sarah was offered  today or  per year for the next  years on the surface the choice appears clear  versus   x  years take the annuity but the choice is impacted by the expected return or discount rate sarah expects to receive on the  over the next  years using the discount rate of  calculated above the annuity payments are worth  when discounted back to the present whereas the lumpsum payment today is  since  is greater than  sarah would take the lumpsum payment other deciding factors there are other basic factors that must almost always be taken into consideration in any pension maximization analysis these variables include your age  one who accepts a lump sum at age  is obviously taking more of a risk than one who receives a similar offer at age  younger clients face a higher level of uncertainty than older ones both financially and in other ways your current health and projected longevity if your family history shows a pattern of predecessors dying of natural causes in their late s or early s then a lumpsum payment may be the way to go conversely someone who is projected to live to age  will quite often come out ahead by taking the pension remember that most lump sum payouts are calculated based on charted life expectancies so those who live past their projected age are at least mathematically likely to beat the lump sum payout you might also consider whether health insurance benefits are tied to the pension payouts in any way your current financial situation if you are in dire straits financially then the lumpsum payout may be necessary  your tax bracket can also be an important consideration if you are in one of the top marginal tax brackets then the bill from uncle sam on a lumpsum payout can be murderous and if you are burdened with a large amount of highinterest obligations it may be wiser to simply take the lump sum to pay off all of your debts rather than continue to pay interest on all of those mortgages car loans credit cards student loans and other consumer liabilities for years to come  a lumpsum payout may also be a good idea for those who intend to continue working at another company and can roll this amount into their new plan or for those who have delayed their social security until a later age and can count on a higher level of guaranteed income from that the projected return on the client’s portfolio from a lumpsum investment if you feel confident your portfolio will be able to generate investment returns that will approximate the total amount that could have been received from the pension then the lump sum may be the way to go of course you need to use a reasonable payout factor here such as  and don’t forget to take drawdown risk into account in your computations current market conditions and interest rates will also obviously play a role and the portfolio that is used must fall within the parameters of your risk tolerance time horizon and specific investment objectives safety if you have a low risk tolerance prefer the discipline of annuitized income or simply dont feel comfortable managing large sums of money then the annuity payout is probably the better option because it’s a safer bet in case of a company plan going bankrupt along with the protection of the pbgc state reinsurance funds often step in to indemnify all customers of an insolvent carrier up to perhaps two or three hundred thousand dollars the cost of life insurance if youre in relatively good health then the purchase of a competitive indexed universal life insurance policy can effectively offset the loss of future pension income and still leave a large sum to use for other things this type of policy can also carry accelerated benefit riders that can help to cover the costs for critical terminal or chronic illness or nursing home care however if you are medically uninsurable then the pension may be the safer route inflation protection a pension payout option that provides a costofliving increase each year is worth far more than one that does not the purchasing power from pensions without this feature will steadily diminish over time so those who opt for this path need to be prepared to either lower their standard of living in the future or else supplement their income from other sources estate planning considerations if you want to leave a legacy for children or other heirs then an annuity is out the payments from these plans always cease at the death of either the retiree or the spouse if a spousal benefit option was elected if the pension payout is clearly the better option then a portion of that income should be diverted into a life insurance policy or provide the body of a trust retirement and definedcontribution plans with a definedcontribution plan you have several options when it comes time to shut that office door leave in you could just leave the plan intact and your money where it is you may in fact find the firm encouraging you to do so if so your assets will continue to grow taxdeferred until you take them out under the irs required minimum distribution rules you have to begin withdrawals once you reach age ½ there may be exceptions however if you are still employed by the company in some capacity installment if your plan allows it you can create an income stream using installment payments or an income annuity – sort of a paycheckstoyourself arrangement throughout the rest of your retirement lifetime if you annuitize bear in mind that the expenses involved could be higher than with an ira roll over you can roll over your k funds to a traditional ira where your assets will continue to grow taxdeferred one advantage of doing this is that you will probably have many more investment choices you can then convert some or all of the traditional ira to a roth ira you can also roll over your k directly into a roth ira in both cases although you will pay taxes on the amount you convert that year all subsequent withdrawals from the roth ira will be taxfree in addition you are not required to make withdrawals from the roth ira at age ½ or in fact at any other time during your life lump sum as with a definedbenefit plan you can take your money in a lump sum you can invest it on your own or pay bills after paying taxes on the distribution keep in mind a lump sum distribution could put you in a higher tax bracket depending on
