carboncarbon bond formation had been assumed to correspond directly with the ze stereochemistry of the alkene products however certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern lithium salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome mechanisms differ for aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and for aromatic and aliphatic phosphonium ylides evidence suggests that the wittig reaction of unbranched aldehydes under lithiumsaltfree conditions do not equilibrate and are therefore under kinetic reaction control vedejs has put forth a theory to explain the stereoselectivity of stabilized and unstabilized wittig reactions wittig reagentsedit preparation of phosphorus ylidesedit wittig reagents are usually prepared from a phosphonium salt which is in turn prepared by the quaternization of triphenylphosphine with an alkyl halide the alkylphosphonium salt is deprotonated with a strong base such as nbutyllithium phpchrx−  chli → phpchr  lix  ch one of the simplest ylide is methylenetriphenylphosphorane phpch it is also a precursor to more elaborate wittig reagents alkylation of phpch with a primary alkyl halide r−ch−x produces substituted phosphonium salts phpch

described in the phosphorane form the more familiar representation or the ylide form the ylide form is a significant contributor and the carbon atom is nucleophilic reactivityedit simple phosphoranes are reactive most hydrolyze and oxidize readily they are therefore prepared using airfree techniques phosphoranes are more airstable when they contain an electron withdrawing group some examples are phpchcor and phpchph these ylides are sufficiently stable to be sold commercially  from the phosphonium salts these reagent are formed more readily requiring only naoh and they are usually more airstablecitation needed these are less reactive than simple ylides and so they usually fail to react with ketones necessitating the use of the horner–wadsworth–emmons reaction as an alternative they usually give rise to an ealkene product when they react rather than the more usual zalkene scope and limitationsedit the wittig reaction is a popular method for the synthesis of alkene from ketones and aldehydes the wittig reagent can generally tolerate carbonyl compounds containing several kinds of functional groups such as oh or aromatic nitro and even ester groupscitation needed there can be a problem with sterically hindered ketones where the reaction may be slow and give poor yields particularly with stabilized ylides and in such cases the horner–wadsworth–emmons hwe reaction using phosphonate esters is preferred another reported limitation is the often labile nature of aldehydes which can oxidize polymerize or decompose in a socalled tandem oxidationwittig process the aldehyde is formed in situ by oxidation of the corresponding alcohol as mentioned above the wittig reagent itself is usually derived from a primary alkyl halide quaternization of triphenylphosphine with most secondary halides is inefficient for this reason wittig reagents are rarely used to prepare tetrasubstituted alkenes however the wittig reagent can tolerate many other variants it may contain alkenes and aromatic rings and it is compatible with ethers and even ester groups even co and nitrile groups can be present if conjugated with the ylide these are the stabilised ylides mentioned above bisylides containing two pc bonds have also been made and used successfully one limitation relates to the stereochemistry of the product with simple ylides the product is usually mainly the zisomer although a lesser amount of the eisomer is often formed also – this is particularly true when ketones are used if the reaction is performed in dmf in the presence of lii or nai the product is almost exclusively the zisomer if the eisomer is the desired product the schlosser modification may be used with stabilised ylides the product is mainly the eisomer and this same isomer is also usual with the hwe reaction schlosser modificationedit the major limitation of the traditional wittig reaction is that the reaction proceeds mainly via the erythro betaine intermediate which leads to the zalkene the erythro betaine can be converted to the threo betaine using phenyllithium at low temperature this modification affords the ealkene allylic alcohols can be prepared by reaction of the betaine ylid with a second aldehyde for example examplesedit because of its reliability and wide applicability the wittig reaction has become a standard tool for synthetic organic chemists the most popular use of the wittig reaction is for the introduction of a methylene group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane phpch using this reagent even a sterically hindered ketone such as camphor can be converted to its methylene derivative in this case the wittig reagent is prepared in situ by deprotonation of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with potassium tertbutoxide in another example the phosphorane is produced using sodium amide as a base and this reagent converts the aldehyde shown into alkene i in  yield the reaction is performed in cold thf and the sensitive nitro azo and phenoxide groups are tolerated the product can be used to incorporate a photostabiliser into a polymer to protect the polymer from damage by uv radiation another example of its use is in the synthesis of leukotriene a methyl ester the first step uses a stabilised ylide where the carbonyl group is conjugated with the ylide preventing self condensation although unexpectedly this gives mainly the cis product the second wittig reaction uses a nonstabilised wittig reagent and as expected this gives mainly the cis product note that the epoxide and ester functional groups survive intact

synthetic organic chemists the most popular use of the wittig reaction is for the introduction of a methylene group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane phpch using this reagent even a sterically hindered ketone such as camphor can be converted to its methylene derivative in this case the wittig reagent is prepared in situ by deprotonation of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with potassium

the sensitive nitro azo and phenoxide groups are tolerated the product can be used to incorporate a photostabiliser into a polymer to protect the polymer from damage by uv radiation another example of its use is in the synthesis of leukotriene a methyl ester the first step uses a stabilised ylide where the carbonyl group is conjugated with the ylide preventing self condensation although

step occurs easily with both aldehydes and ketones and the decomposition of the betaine to form  is the ratedetermining step however with stabilised ylides where r stabilises the negative charge the first step is the slowest step so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the eisomer this also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with sterically hindered ketones mechanismedit mechanistic studies have focused on unstabilized ylides because the intermediates can be followed by nmr spectroscopy the existence and interconversion of the betaine a and b is subject of ongoing research phosphonium ylides  react with carbonyl compounds  via a π²sπ²a  cycloaddition to directly form the oxaphosphetanes a and b the stereochemistry of the product  is due to the addition of the ylide  to the carbonyl  and to the equilibration of the intermediates maryanoff and reitz identified the issue about equilibration of wittig intermediates and termed the process stereochemical drift for many years the stereochemistry of the wittig reaction in terms of carboncarbon bond formation had been assumed to correspond directly with the ze stereochemistry of the alkene products however certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern lithium salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome mechanisms differ for aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and for aromatic and aliphatic phosphonium ylides evidence suggests that the wittig reaction of unbranched aldehydes under lithiumsaltfree conditions do not equilibrate and are therefore under kinetic reaction control vedejs has put forth a theory to explain the stereoselectivity of stabilized and unstabilized wittig reactions wittig reagentsedit preparation of phosphorus ylidesedit wittig reagents are usually prepared from a phosphonium salt which is in turn prepared by the quaternization of triphenylphosphine with an alkyl halide the alkylphosphonium salt is deprotonated with a strong base such as nbutyllithium phpchrx−  chli → phpchr  lix  ch one of the simplest ylide is methylenetriphenylphosphorane phpch it is also a precursor to more elaborate wittig reagents alkylation of phpch with a primary alkyl halide r−ch−x produces substituted phosphonium salts phpch  rchx → phpchchr x− these salts can be deprotonated in the usual way to give phpch−chr structure of the ylideedit ballandstick model of phpch as found in the crystal structure the wittig reagent may be described in the phosphorane form the more familiar representation or the ylide form the ylide form is a significant contributor and the carbon atom is nucleophilic reactivityedit simple phosphoranes are reactive most hydrolyze and oxidize readily they are therefore prepared using airfree techniques phosphoranes are more airstable when they contain an electron withdrawing group some examples are phpchcor and phpchph these ylides are sufficiently stable to be sold commercially  from the phosphonium salts these reagent are formed more readily requiring only naoh and they are usually more airstablecitation needed these are less reactive than simple ylides and so they usually fail to react with ketones necessitating the use of the horner–wadsworth–emmons reaction as an alternative they usually give rise to an ealkene product when they react rather than the more usual zalkene scope and limitationsedit the wittig reaction is a popular method for the synthesis of alkene from ketones and aldehydes the wittig reagent can generally tolerate carbonyl compounds containing several kinds of functional groups such as oh or aromatic nitro and even ester groupscitation needed there can be a problem with sterically hindered ketones where the reaction may be slow and give poor yields particularly with stabilized ylides and in such cases the horner–wadsworth–emmons hwe reaction using phosphonate esters is preferred another reported limitation is the often labile nature of aldehydes which can oxidize polymerize or decompose in a socalled tandem oxidationwittig process the aldehyde is formed in situ by oxidation of the corresponding alcohol as mentioned above the wittig reagent itself is usually derived from a primary alkyl halide quaternization of triphenylphosphine with most secondary halides is inefficient for this reason wittig reagents are rarely used to prepare tetrasubstituted alkenes however the wittig reagent can tolerate many other variants it may contain alkenes and aromatic rings and it is compatible with ethers and even ester groups even co and nitrile groups can be present if conjugated with the ylide these are the stabilised ylides mentioned above bisylides containing two pc bonds have also been made and used successfully one limitation relates to the stereochemistry of the product with simple ylides the product is usually mainly the zisomer although a lesser amount of the

peterson olefination schlosser modification seyferthgilbert homologation tebbe olefination wittighorner reaction wittig reaction the wittig reaction allows the preparation of an alkene by the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with the ylide generated from a phosphonium salt the geometry of the resulting alkene depends on the reactivity of the ylide if r is ph or r is an electron withdrawing group then the ylide is stabilized and is not as reactive as when r and r are alkyl stabilized ylides give ealkenes whereas nonstabilized ylides lead to zalkenes see also wittighorner reaction mechanism of the wittig reaction  cycloaddition of the ylide to the carbonyl forms a fourmembered cyclic intermediate an oxaphosphetane preliminary posultated mechanisms lead first to a betaine as a zwitterionic intermediate which would then close to the oxaphosphetane the intermediacy of such betaines plays an important role in the schlosser modification betaines may be stabilized by lithium salts leading to side products therefore suitable bases in the wittig reaction are for example nah naome net the driving force is the formation of a very stable phosphine oxide reactive ylides give rapid reaction and subsequent rapid ring opening to give the zalkene recent literature recycling the waste the development of a catalytic wittig reaction c j obrien j l tellez z s nixon l j kang a l carter s r kunkel k
