over as ceo of online textbook rental startup chegg february   at  am pt tweet share print longtime silicon valley exec dan rosensweig pictured here is stepping down as ceo and president of the guitar hero division of activision blizzard to take a new job as president and ceo of chegg the top online textbook rental startup both companies confirmed the move which is somewhat unexpected given that the former yahoo yhoo coo landed the job running the top gaming franchise in march of last year it has been an eventful but also a particularly tough year at guitar hero in the face of yet another withering downturn in the gaming market while activision atvi introduced a new version of its flagship guitar hero game as well as a new dj hero band hero and a guitar hero van halen version sales were weaker overall even though dj hero was the the no  new game in both the us and europe nonetheless according to a recent report from research firm npd group sales in the videogame space were down eight percent in  from  and while guitar hero did gain market share as the most popular such game in its genre most expect its trajectory to be downward guitar hero  sold slightly fewer than  units from september through december in north america for example according to npd while global sales were better guitar hero world tour in comparison sold  million units the year earlier in contrast rosensweig–who is probably much more suited to the pure web space and the silicon valley scene–will be taking over a much fastergrowing business at chegg based in santa clara calif it has become the frontrunner in the increasingly competitive online textbook rental space to help maintain that lead chegg has garnered a huge  million investment kitty top venture firms such as kleiner perkins foundation capital and most recently insight venture partners have presumably handed over that money to cofounders osman rashid and aayush phumbhra in hopes of big returns the pair started chegg in  at iowa state university as a classified rental service where books were the dominant item but evolved its business to focus on actually doing the textbook rentals the company’s unusual name chegg is a mashup of chicken and egg and its model is similar to that of innovative video rental outfit netflix nflx chegg now serves close to  schools across the us and has a cute and studentfriendly practice of planting a tree for every textbook rented bought or sold with  employees in silicon valley and more at a warehouse operation in louisville ky chegg claims it has grown over  percent year over year since its founding although the startup would not provide more specifics on financials a spokeswoman said that company rented more books in january of this year than all of last year and has saved students more than  million typically a rental costs a fraction of what buying a book outright does it is ordered online and then sent to a renter who then returns it all this activity has attracted a lot of interest from both big and small players especially given the  billion college textbook business while one can assume that a lot of chegg’s business will eventually move to digital downloads especially as the use of ereaders explodes the physical business is strong for the near term the barnes  noble bks college division recently began testing a textbook rental program for example and is rolling it out to  us colleges and bookrenter is a smaller competitor but with chegg rosensweig is getting to ride the lead horse in the space taking over from current ceo rashid in an interview a year ago in fact rashid said “i do not want to be a longterm ceo my passion is solving the problem and getting the company to a place where it can be taken to the next step” while he will remain chairman the entrepreneur has recently closed  million in funding for a new stealth startup called kakai sources have said it is focused on the even more crowded ereader space the replacement for rosensweig–who had been working in private equity since his departure from yahoo yhoo in late  and has also worked at cnet networks and ziffdavis–will be the guitar hero division’s current coo david haddad until he has something to say about chegg here is a video interview i did with rosensweig in september when the new version of gh as well as band hero and dj hero were launching here is the full press release from chegg about the appointment cheggcom names daniel rosensweig as president and chief executive officer appointment accelerates explosive growth of market leader in textbook rentals santa clara calif feb  prnewswire–cheggcom the no  online textbook rental company today announced that it has appointed daniel rosensweig as its new president and chief executive officer ceo effective immediately rosensweig joins a company that closed  million in funding from insight venture partners pinnacle ventures and triplepoint capital in november that round added to the already impressive list of investors including kleiner perkins caufield  byers foundation capital gabriel venture partners and primera capital “we are thrilled that dan is joining us as our president and ceo”

sales rosensweig started his career at ziffdavis where he spent  years in a variety of senior positions including president of the ziffdavis internet publishing group vice president and publisher of pc magazine and president and ceo of zdnet which he built from a standalone ziffdavis company to a publiclytraded highlytrafficked internet network “the opportunity to lead one of silicon valley’s fastest growing companies that offers real financial value to students is unparalleled” said rosensweig “cheggcom has a powerful business model and i believe the opportunity to transform the textbook industry” the high cost of textbooks is a real social and economic problem that is burdening millions of students and their families cheggcom’s innovative and convenient textbook rental model is helping relieve this burden and has already saved students more than  million “we invested in cheggcom because of its impressive business model and unique value proposition – helping students and
