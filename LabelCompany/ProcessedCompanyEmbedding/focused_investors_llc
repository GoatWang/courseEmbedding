of mgmt fees    fi concentrated value composite net of mgmt fees    russell ® value index benchmark       important performance disclosures are at the end of this letter  annualized inception date august   we outperformed our benchmark during the second quarter our current portfolio holds  companies in contrast to the nearly  companies that comprise our benchmark given this significant difference in composition it is not unusual for the shortterm performance of our portfolio and our benchmark to diverge meaningfully we try not to place undue importance on quarterly performance and encourage our clients not to as well nonetheless we admit that we prefer it when the divergence works in our favor as it did last quarter us equity market valuations remain elevated and in our opinion subject investors to a heightened risk of permanent loss of capital we take comfort in owning a portfolio of high quality companies that in aggregate are moderately undervalued based on conservative estimates of their underlying business value we believe the margin of safety reflected in our portfolios current valuation provides a level of downside protection that is lacking in the overall us equity market from an attribution perspective our most recent quarterly performance benefited substantially from our significant overweighting in health care the benchmarks best performing sector as well as from the relative outperformance of our holdings in the sector we also benefited from our complete lack of exposure to energy and telecommunication services the benchmarks worstperforming sectors and the only two that generated negative returns for the quarter in addition our holdings in consumer discretionary consumer staples and industrials all outperformed their respective sector holdings in the benchmark adding positively to our relative performance our information technology holdings detracted from our relative performance due entirely to our position in ibm our significant underweighting in financials the benchmarks secondbest performing sector also detracted modestly from our performance turning to individual companies mcdonalds was the single largest positive contributor to our quarterly performance mcdonalds financial results continue to improve as a result of initiatives implemented under the leadership of steve easterbrook who became ceo in march  these initiatives have focused on drawing more customers into mcdonalds restaurants improving relationships with franchisees and optimizing the companys capital structure and cash flows restaurant sales are improving as customers respond positively to improvements in food taste and quality improved service times in restaurants and drivethroughs and menu changes designed to convey a better perception of value the companys relationship with franchisees has benefited from the success of the companys initiatives to improve sales as well as from managements more collaborative approach in working with franchisees including soliciting ideas from them and sharing more in the cost of renovating and modernizing their restaurants managements actions to optimize the companys capital structure and cash flows have been just as impressive as the recent operational improvements during the past two years management issued lowcost debt to fund the repurchase of significantly undervalued mcdonalds stock reducing shares outstanding by about  balance sheet leverage is up but not excessively and is now more appropriate for a company with mcdonalds stable cash flows the company also accelerated its refranchising efforts with the goal of having  of its global restaurant base operated by franchisees up from roughly  when mr easterbrook became ceo converting a restaurant from companyowned to franchiseeoperated improves the stability of mcdonalds cash flows and generally results in a bettermanaged more profitable restaurant mcdonalds financial results and consensus estimates for future earnings have steadily improved during the past two years we have revised our financial modeling assumptions to reflect these improvements and our estimated value for mcdonalds has increased accordingly however mcdonalds stock price has outpaced the growth in the companys intrinsic value mcdonalds remains undervalued but less so now given its recent price appreciation so we reduced our position during the quarter aetna anthem and unitedhealth all contributed nicely to our performance after reporting strong quarterly financial results and raising their eps guidance for the current year in addition anthem finally agreed to terminate its merger agreement with cigna after receiving yet another court decision blocking the merger based on antitrust concerns aetna already called off its merger with humana last february for similar reasons we believe that anthem management can now focus on growing its existing business and pursuing other growth opportunities without being distracted by its attempt to win court approval of the cigna merger there continues to be considerable desire on the part of the trump administration to repeal replace or somehow alter the affordable care act aca however to date there has been a lack of consensus on what those changes should be and whether they are politically feasible as investors in the health care sector we have a vested interest in monitoring potential changes to the aca especially if they negatively affect our view of the investment merits and intrinsic values of the companies we own fortunately to date none of the proposed or publicly discussed changes have caused us too much concern and we remain very comfortable with the health care companies we own and our overall weighting in the sector among the proposed changes attempts to reduce medicaid funding have garnered most of our attention all of the managed care companies we own provide medicaid coverage so any reduced funding would impact them to varying degrees this is one of the most contentious issues currently being discussed and any changes would most likely need to be phasedin over time helping mitigate their impact on our companies there also have been proposals that would affect the aca mandated health insurance exchanges ranging from stabilizing them to doing away with them entirely either outcome would most likely benefit our companies since they currently operate at a loss in the exchanges however our companies have largely exited the exchanges so the impact would be modest taking steps to limit or reduce prescription drug prices is not really part of aca reform but it is part of the broader discussion surrounding health care costs proponents of drug price controls often focus on highpriced specialty drugs that are expensive to manufacture and distribute and orphan drugs that have limited patient populations and face little to no competition proposals to reduce drug costs include simple price controls allowing importation of drugs from overseas where they are generally much cheaper shortening the fda approval process to allow competing drugs to come to market quicker and giving the federal government more leeway in negotiating prices there clearly have been abuses in drug pricing as evidenced by mylans wellpublicized  price increase for epipens since acquiring the rights for the product in  however we believe most major pharmaceutical companies including johnson  johnson jj which we own have been far more responsible in setting drug prices it is also common knowledge that discovering and developing new drugs and getting fda approval is an extremely long and expensive process for example jj spent  billion  of sales on rd in its pharmaceutical business in  the us is generally considered the leader in drug innovation in large part based on us drug companies ability to fund such substantial investments in rd concerns over stifling new drug discovery and industry lobbying efforts stopped past efforts to control drug prices and we suspect they will continue to do so if we are wrong jj is the only company in our portfolio that would be directly affected jj generates about  of its total profits from pharmaceuticals but a number of the companys drugs already face significant competition and pricing pressure we believe any actions to limit drug pricing will be manageable by jj and we remain comfortable with our position in the company our financial companies turned in mixed performance with american express jpmorgan and morgan stanley all reporting better than expected quarterly financial results while results for goldman sachs and wells fargo were disappointing in contrast to its peers goldman reported weak trading results goldman attributed the weakness to the nature of its client base and the inherent volatility in the business both explanations seem reasonable to us we remain comfortable with our goldman position and consider it to be one of the more undervalued companies in our portfolio wells fargos quarterly results disappointed investors as asset growth and net interest income came in lower than expected while operating expenses came in higher these unfavorable trends primarily reflect continued fallout from the companys misguided retail sales practices that resulted in opening millions of unauthorized customer accounts at the companys recent investor day management laid out aggressive plans to restore customer trust resume asset growth and reduce operating expenses to get the companys earnings back on track we have confidence that management is taking the appropriate steps and believe wells fargo remains undervalued in june the federal reserve released its stress test results in which our companies were all found to be adequately capitalized and received approval for their capital plans for the next twelve months after receiving approval american express jpmorgan morgan stanley and wells fargo all announced dividend increases and increased share repurchase programs consistent with prior years goldman sachs did not immediately release details of its approved capital plan however goldman already announced a dividend increase earlier in the quarter and we have no doubt the company will continue its past policy of significant share repurchases ibm was our worst performer and biggest detractor from performance the companys recently reported adjusted operating eps beat expectations but the quality of earnings was low revenues were weaker than expected and the eps beat was driven by higher intellectual property income and onetime tax benefits on a positive note the companys strategic initiatives are generating healthy growth but off of a relatively modest base capital allocation remains shareholderfriendly as management continues to repurchase stock and recently announced a  dividend increase ibms efforts to focus on its faster growing markets are beginning to bear fruit albeit slowly and management has made good progress in reducing operating expenses nonetheless we thought it was prudent to reduce our estimate of ibms intrinsic value to reflect the challenging business trends reflected in the companys most recent results we trimmed our ibm position to reflect the companys less attractive pricevalue ratio we added a new position in cbs to our portfolio cbs is a diversified media and entertainment company best known for its cbs television network cbs also owns a premium subscription program service showtime networks a publishing business including simon  schuster television and radio stations and it produces television programming and theatrical films similar to time warner which we added to our portfolio last year cbs has benefited from the increasing consumption of media content cbs generates moderate revenue growth with strong operating margins and significant excess cash flow revenue growth during the past few years has been masked as the company exited nonstrategic businesses later this year cbs plans to dispose of its radio business which should complete the intended asset disposals based on the companys strong cash flows combined with proceeds from asset sales management has reduced shares outstanding by nearly  during the past  years through share repurchases while consistently increasing the annual dividend we expect this shareholderfriendly capital allocation policy to continue the companys current valuation reflects legitimate concerns about changes in consumer viewing habits and increased viewing options consumers especially millennials and younger viewers are increasingly watching video content on pcs and mobile devices this content may come from traditional sources like cbs or from new programming entrants such as netflix or amazon that offer monthly subscriptions that are much cheaper than subscriptions offered by traditional multichannel video programming distributors mvpds mvpds include cable television operators direct broadcast satellite operators and telephone companies as a result mvpd subscriber levels plateaued several years ago in the us and have been declining by roughly  annually an added concern is that mvpds in an effort to compete with these less expensive services will offer skinny bundles with fewer channels or allow subscribers to create à la carte bundles consisting only of the channels they wish to receive to the extent that these trends reduce viewership of networks such as cbs advertising revenues and the fees received from mvpds for access to the networks programming may decline however as with time warner cbs is moving aggressively to capitalize on these changing viewing habits by developing new services that deliver its programming directly to consumers without requiring a traditional mvpd subscription cbs is also distributing its programming by partnering with nontraditional video delivery services such as hulu youtube tv sling tv etc as viewership becomes increasingly splintered by the proliferation of alternative programming sources the three major television networks abc cbs and nbc should continue to profit handsomely from their unique ability to provide advertisers with largescale audiences we also expect cbs to develop additional services and partnerships to monetize the value of its popular highquality video content while we acknowledge that cbs faces headwinds as the video marketplace evolves we believe the company is wellpositioned to meet these challenges cbs was the only addition to our portfolio during the quarter in addition to the modest reductions in our mcdonalds and ibm positions previously discussed we also trimmed our positions in m and microsoft as the companies share prices continued to rise we also completed the sale of bed bath  beyond that we initiated at the end of last quarter there was no other significant activity in our portfolio we recently said goodbye to lauren warsavsky our

strategy the fi concentrated value composite was created on august   and contains all fully discretionary feepaying accounts that are managed according to fis concentrated value strategy fis concentrated value strategy seeks to invest client assets primarily in common stocks of companies that are trading at prices significantly below fis estimate of their intrinsic values at the time of initial purchase accounts that participate in the composite can be separately managed institutional accounts or pooled investment vehicles the fi concentrated value composite is the firms only composite at this time a complete description of the composite and additional information regarding policies for valuing portfolios calculating performance and preparing the compliant presentation is available upon request the composites benchmark is the russell ® value index and is provided to represent the investment environment existing during the time periods shown the russell ® value index measures the performance of the largecap value segment of the us equity universe it includes those russell  companies with lower pricetobook ratios and lower than expected growth values the russell ® value index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the largecap value segment the index is completely reconstituted annually to ensure new and growing equities are included and that the represented companies continue to reflect value characteristics for comparison purposes the russell ® value index returns do not reflect transaction costs management fees or other expenses that would be incurred in managing an account while fis objective is to outperform its benchmark this does not imply that fis portfolio strategy will share or track the same or similar characteristics as the benchmark in addition there can be no guarantee that fi will achieve its objective the index returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers performance for the composite and the benchmark is calculated on a total return basis which includes reinvestment of all income plus realized and unrealized gains andor losses individual account performance will vary depending upon among other things timing of transactions and market conditions at the time of investment returns are stated in us dollars because fis portfolios are relatively concentrated the performance of each holding will have a greater impact on an accounts total return and may make the return more volatile than a more diversified portfolio in addition while fi believes that the portfolio holdings are value stocks there can be no assurance that others will consider them as such past performance does not guarantee future results as with any investment vehicle there is always

performance secondquarter yeartodate since    inception fi concentrated value composite gross of mgmt fees    fi concentrated value composite net of mgmt fees    russell ® value index benchmark       important performance disclosures are at the end of this letter  annualized inception date august   we outperformed our benchmark during the second quarter our current portfolio holds  companies in contrast to the nearly  companies that comprise our benchmark given this significant difference in composition it is not unusual for the shortterm performance of our portfolio and our benchmark to diverge meaningfully we try not to place undue importance on quarterly performance and encourage our clients not to as well nonetheless we admit that we prefer it when the divergence works in our favor as it did last quarter us equity market valuations remain elevated and in our opinion subject investors to a heightened risk of permanent loss of capital we take comfort in owning a portfolio of high quality companies that in aggregate are moderately undervalued based on conservative estimates of their underlying business value we believe the margin of safety reflected in our portfolios current valuation provides a level of downside protection that is lacking in the overall us equity market from an attribution perspective our most recent quarterly performance benefited substantially from our significant overweighting in health care the benchmarks best performing sector as well as from the relative outperformance of our holdings in the sector we also benefited from our complete lack of exposure to energy and telecommunication services the benchmarks worstperforming sectors and the only two that generated negative returns for the quarter in addition our holdings in consumer discretionary consumer staples and industrials all outperformed their respective sector holdings in the benchmark adding positively to our relative performance our information technology holdings detracted from our relative performance due entirely to our position in ibm our significant underweighting in financials the benchmarks secondbest performing sector also detracted modestly from our performance turning to individual companies mcdonalds was the single largest positive contributor to our quarterly performance mcdonalds financial results continue to improve as a result of initiatives implemented under the leadership of steve easterbrook who became ceo in march  these initiatives have focused on drawing more customers into mcdonalds restaurants improving relationships with franchisees and optimizing the companys capital structure and cash flows restaurant sales are improving as customers respond positively to improvements in food taste and quality improved service times in restaurants and drivethroughs and menu changes designed to convey a better perception of value the companys relationship with franchisees has benefited from the success of the companys initiatives to improve sales as well as from managements more collaborative approach in working with franchisees including soliciting ideas from them and sharing more in the cost of renovating and modernizing their restaurants managements actions to optimize the companys capital structure and cash flows have been just as impressive as the recent operational improvements during the past two years management issued lowcost debt to fund the repurchase of significantly undervalued mcdonalds stock reducing shares outstanding by about  balance sheet leverage is up but not excessively and is now more appropriate for a company with mcdonalds stable cash flows the company also accelerated its refranchising efforts with the goal of having  of its global restaurant base operated by franchisees up from roughly  when mr easterbrook became ceo converting a restaurant from companyowned to franchiseeoperated improves the stability of mcdonalds cash flows and generally results in a bettermanaged more profitable restaurant mcdonalds financial results and consensus estimates for future earnings have steadily improved during the past two years we have revised our financial modeling assumptions to reflect these improvements and our estimated value for mcdonalds has increased accordingly however mcdonalds stock price has outpaced the growth in the companys intrinsic value mcdonalds remains undervalued but less so now given its recent price appreciation so we reduced our position during the quarter aetna anthem and unitedhealth all contributed nicely to our performance after reporting strong quarterly financial results and raising their eps guidance for the current year in addition anthem finally agreed to terminate its merger agreement with cigna after receiving yet another court decision blocking the merger based on antitrust concerns aetna already called off its merger with humana last february for similar reasons we believe that anthem management can now focus on growing its existing business and pursuing other growth opportunities without being distracted by its attempt to win court approval of the cigna merger there continues to be considerable desire on the part of the trump administration to repeal replace or somehow alter the affordable care act aca however to date there has been a lack of consensus on what those changes should be and whether they are politically feasible as investors in the health care sector we have a vested interest in monitoring potential changes to the aca especially if they negatively affect our view of the investment merits and intrinsic values of the companies we own fortunately to date none of the proposed or publicly discussed changes have caused us too much concern and we remain very comfortable with the health care companies we own and our overall weighting in the sector among the proposed changes attempts to reduce medicaid funding have garnered most of our attention all of the managed care companies we own provide medicaid coverage so any reduced funding would impact them to varying degrees this is one of the most contentious issues currently being discussed and any changes would most likely need to be phasedin over time helping mitigate their impact on our companies there also have been proposals that would affect the aca mandated health insurance exchanges ranging from stabilizing them to doing away with them entirely either outcome would most likely benefit our companies since they currently operate at a loss in the exchanges however our companies have largely exited the exchanges so the impact would be modest taking steps to limit or reduce prescription drug prices is not really part of aca reform but it is part of the broader discussion surrounding health care costs proponents of drug price controls often focus on highpriced specialty drugs that are expensive to manufacture and distribute and orphan drugs that have limited patient populations and face little to no competition proposals to reduce drug costs include simple price controls allowing importation of drugs from overseas where they are generally much cheaper shortening the fda approval process to allow competing drugs to come to market quicker and giving the federal government more leeway in negotiating prices there clearly have been abuses in drug pricing as evidenced by mylans wellpublicized  price increase for epipens since acquiring the rights for the product in  however we believe most major pharmaceutical companies including johnson  johnson jj which we own have been far more responsible in setting drug prices it is also common knowledge that discovering and developing new drugs and getting fda approval is an extremely long and expensive process for example jj spent  billion  of sales on rd in its pharmaceutical business in  the us is generally considered the leader in drug innovation in large part based on us drug companies ability to fund such substantial investments in rd concerns over stifling new drug discovery and industry lobbying efforts stopped past efforts to control drug prices and we suspect they will continue to do so if we are wrong jj is the only company in our portfolio that would be directly affected jj generates about  of its total profits from pharmaceuticals but a number of the companys drugs already face significant competition and pricing pressure we believe any actions to limit drug pricing will be manageable by jj and we remain comfortable with our position in the company our financial companies turned in mixed performance with american express jpmorgan and morgan stanley all reporting better than expected quarterly financial results while results for goldman sachs and wells fargo were disappointing in contrast to its peers goldman reported weak trading results goldman attributed the weakness to the nature of its client base and the inherent volatility in the business both explanations seem reasonable to us we remain comfortable with our goldman position and consider it to be one of the more undervalued companies in our portfolio wells fargos quarterly results disappointed investors as asset growth and net interest income came in lower than expected while operating expenses came in higher these unfavorable trends primarily reflect continued fallout from the companys misguided retail sales practices that resulted in opening millions of unauthorized customer accounts at the companys recent investor day management laid out aggressive plans to restore customer trust resume asset growth and reduce operating expenses to get the companys earnings back on track we have confidence that management is taking the appropriate steps and believe wells fargo remains undervalued in june the federal reserve released its stress test results in which our companies were all found to be adequately capitalized and received approval for their capital plans for the next twelve months after receiving approval american express jpmorgan morgan stanley and wells fargo all announced dividend increases and increased share repurchase programs consistent with prior years goldman sachs did not immediately release details of its approved capital plan however goldman already announced a dividend increase earlier in the quarter and we have no doubt the company will continue its past policy of significant share repurchases ibm was our worst performer and biggest detractor from performance the companys recently reported adjusted operating eps beat expectations but the quality of earnings was low revenues were weaker than expected and the eps beat was driven by higher intellectual property income and onetime tax benefits on a positive note the companys strategic initiatives are generating healthy growth but off of a relatively modest base capital allocation remains shareholderfriendly as management continues to repurchase stock and recently announced a  dividend increase ibms efforts to focus on its faster growing markets are beginning to bear fruit albeit slowly and management has made good progress in reducing operating expenses nonetheless we thought it was prudent to reduce our estimate of ibms intrinsic value to reflect the challenging business trends reflected in the companys most recent results we trimmed our ibm position to reflect the companys less attractive pricevalue ratio we added a new position in cbs to our portfolio cbs is a diversified media and entertainment company best known for its cbs television network cbs also owns a premium subscription program service showtime networks a publishing business including simon  schuster television and radio stations and it produces television programming and theatrical films similar to time warner which we added to our portfolio last year cbs has benefited from the increasing consumption of media content cbs generates moderate revenue growth with strong operating margins and significant excess cash flow revenue growth during the past few years has been masked as the company exited nonstrategic businesses later this year cbs plans to dispose of its radio business which should complete the intended asset disposals based on the companys strong cash flows combined with proceeds from asset sales management has reduced shares outstanding by nearly  during the past  years through share repurchases while consistently increasing the annual dividend we expect this shareholderfriendly capital allocation policy to continue the companys current valuation reflects legitimate concerns about changes in consumer viewing habits and increased viewing options consumers especially millennials and younger viewers are increasingly watching video content on pcs and mobile devices this content may come from traditional sources like cbs or from new programming entrants such as netflix or amazon that offer monthly subscriptions that are much cheaper than subscriptions offered by traditional multichannel video programming distributors mvpds mvpds include cable television operators direct broadcast satellite operators and telephone companies as a result mvpd subscriber levels plateaued several years ago in the us and have been declining by roughly  annually an added concern is that mvpds in an effort to compete with these less expensive services will offer skinny bundles with fewer channels or allow subscribers to create à la carte bundles consisting only of the channels they wish to receive to the extent that these trends reduce viewership of networks such as cbs advertising revenues and the fees received from mvpds for access to the networks programming may decline however as with time warner cbs is moving aggressively to capitalize on these changing viewing habits by developing new services that deliver its programming directly to consumers without requiring a traditional mvpd subscription cbs is also distributing its programming by partnering with nontraditional video delivery services such as hulu youtube tv sling tv etc as viewership becomes increasingly splintered by the proliferation of alternative programming sources the three major television networks abc cbs and nbc should continue to profit handsomely from their unique ability to provide advertisers with largescale audiences we also expect cbs to develop additional services and partnerships to monetize the value of its popular highquality video content while we acknowledge that cbs faces headwinds as the video marketplace evolves we believe the company is wellpositioned to meet these challenges cbs was the only addition to our portfolio during the quarter in addition to the modest reductions in our mcdonalds and ibm positions previously discussed we also trimmed our positions in m and microsoft as the companies share prices continued to rise we also completed the sale of bed bath  beyond that we initiated at the end of last quarter there was no other significant activity in our portfolio we recently said goodbye to lauren warsavsky our investment analyst who is moving back to new york to attend columbia business school we enjoyed working with lauren and wish her well we are

soeharto partner andportfolio manager partner andportfolio manager     performance disclosures founded in  focused investors llc fi is an independent investment management firm registered as an investment adviser with the us securities and exchange commission registration with the us securities and exchange commission does not imply a certain level of skill or training fi is a value driven investment manager specializing in a concentrated portfolio strategy the fi concentrated value composite was created on august   and contains all fully discretionary feepaying accounts that are managed according to fis concentrated value strategy fis concentrated value strategy seeks to invest client assets primarily in common stocks of companies that are trading at prices significantly below fis estimate of their intrinsic values at the time of initial purchase accounts that participate in the composite can be separately managed institutional accounts or pooled investment vehicles the fi concentrated value composite is the firms only composite at this time a complete description of the composite and additional information regarding policies for valuing portfolios calculating performance and preparing the compliant presentation is available upon request the composites benchmark is the russell ® value index and is provided to represent the investment environment existing during the time periods shown the russell ® value index measures the performance of the largecap value segment of the us equity universe it includes those russell  companies with lower pricetobook ratios and lower than expected growth values the russell ® value index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the largecap value segment the index is completely reconstituted annually to ensure new and growing equities are included and that the represented companies continue to reflect value characteristics for comparison purposes the russell ® value index returns do not reflect transaction costs management fees or other expenses that would be incurred in managing an account while fis objective is to outperform its benchmark this does not imply that fis portfolio strategy will share or track the same or similar characteristics as the benchmark in addition there can be no guarantee that fi will achieve its objective the index returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers performance for the composite and the benchmark is calculated on a total return basis which includes reinvestment of all income plus realized and unrealized gains andor losses individual account performance will vary depending upon among other things timing of transactions and market conditions at the time of investment returns are stated in us dollars because fis portfolios are relatively concentrated the performance of each holding will have a greater impact on an accounts total return and may make the return more volatile than a more diversified portfolio in addition while fi believes that the portfolio holdings are value stocks there can be no assurance that others will consider them as such past performance does not guarantee future results as with any investment vehicle there is always the potential for gain as well as the possibility of loss grossoffees performance returns are presented before management and custodial fees but after all trading expenses prior to january   netoffees performance returns were calculated by deducting onetwelfth of the highest management fee borne by any account in the composite  from the monthly gross composite return in  and  subsequent netoffees performance returns are calculated by applying the standard management fee schedule for separately managed accounts including tiers to all accounts in the composite beginning january   fi began using actual fees to compute netoffees performance returns actual fees vary fis standard management fee schedule for institutional separately managed accounts is as follows  bps on the first  million of assets under management  bps on the next  million of assets under management  bps on the next  million of assets under management  bps on the next  million of assets under management  bps on all assets under management in excess of  million and  bps on all assets under management in excess of  million based on this fee schedule accounts of the following varying sizes would pay an effective annual fee of account size millions      effective annual fee bps      fis management fees are more fully described in form adv part ii which is available upon request the composite includes a pooled investment vehicle in which certain participants do not pay a management fee as of december              of nonfee paying accounts            no measure of dispersion is presented for periods where there are less than five accounts in the composite for the full year as it is not considered meaningful internal dispersion is calculated using the
