learning methods with our proprietary content and digital delivery platforms these solutions provide immediate feedback and we believe they are more effective than traditional print textbooks in driving positive student outcomes students’ yearoveryear performance can be impacted by many factors outside the instructional materials used in class we believe that even taking into account these factors our learning solutions can contribute to significant improvements in students’ classroom performance as well as improved student retention for the instructor time spent on active learning experiences increases significantly as a result of a reduction in time spent on administrative tasks and the availability of critical data to help better focus in class instruction we have conducted numerous case studies for several of our learning solutions for colleges that used connectlearnsmart smartbook and aleks and in each case where our solutions have been implemented our case studies have yielded positive findings when compared to class performance in periods immediately prior to implementation many of which have been considerable for example according to a  study by the

their average final exam score to increase by over  points when compared to nonparticipating students students who completed a precourse assignment on a traditional responsive homework system saw an average increase in their final exam score by  points versus those who did not participate students who worked on the online homework for the entire quarter saw even greater gains in their final exam
