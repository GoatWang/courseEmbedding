visibility among investors recent ipo of partner vantiv has already appreciated  introduction planet payment inc is an emerging growth company that has reached the inflection point of profitability and has entered a selffunding hypergrowth phase requiring little incremental capital expenditure its market valuation appears to reflect expectations for the typical lifecycle of a payment processor operating in a highly competitive environment but planet is far from a typical payment processor we believe it is an infrastructure play on the mechanics of multicurrency payment processing and after a decade and  million of capital invested one of the first companies to have laid the new foundation it has only scratched the surface of a nascent and growing multibillion dollar global market opportunity in dynamic currency conversion and has a clear runway for sustainable growth over the foreseeable future the company is positioned at the forefront of several overarching changes taking place in the market for international payment processing including shifts from paper to electronic payments increased international travel and commerce and increased adoption of ecommerce the company has numerous untapped opportunities that are likely to greatly expand its market potential the most notable immediate opportunity is the rapidly growing latin american market where the company has initiated a market expansion and we believe is on the verge of announcing partnership opportunities the companys differentiated technological advantage is in its single unified currencyagnostic payment processing platform and is the reason planet payment has earned the business of some of the largest international banks and processors the platform is built on a unified architecture with a centralized database as opposed to the processing platforms of some of its primary dcc competitors that use a regionalized architecture and database allowing acquiring banks to support the growth of their international merchant customers without complication planets client base currently includes more than  acquiring banks and processors spanning more than  countries and territories across the asia pacific region north america the middle east africa and europe including established markets in china hong kong macau taiwan and malaysia in  its base of active merchant locations grew more than  by over  to almost  active locations as planets global profile increases and the value of its solutions are realized in new geographic markets the company experiences network effects driving accelerating adoption of its services and increasing the value of its platform this creates significant barriers to entry and results in earnings leverage for shareholders given the recurring revenue features of its customer contracts and largely fixed operating expense of its platform in  planets revenue grew  to  million and ebitda grew  to  million net income was  million versus a loss of  million in  we believe the company has a clear runway to continue to grow revenue at  per year over the next  years and that it has the potential to grow much faster the current market price for planets equity far understates the companys longterm growth potential and presents a highly positively skewed riskreward profile with little risk of permanent capital impairment over a multiyear horizon we believe the equity has a fair value of  per share and that the exposure the company will receive in connection with its impending reipo will be a catalyst to unlock value from current trading levels business overview any international traveler is undoubtedly familiar with the experience of hastily performing mental calculations to determine what something will cost in their home currency a us traveler in japan for example may ask himself whether he should purchase an ipod for  yen even if he could estimate the payment amount in us dollars based on prevailing exchange rates the final charge that would show on the credit card statement a month later would remain uncertain the exchange rate eventually locked in would not be disclosed and the cardissuing bank would layer an international transaction fee of  onto the purchase but if the ipod were priced in us dollars  at the pointofsale the decision would be simplified philip beck an international banking and corporate attorney by background identified these and other issues inherent to the processing of multicurrency credit card transactions and in  founded planet payment inc to develop a solution planets platform

the choice of paying for purchases or atm withdrawals in their home currency based upon a conversion performed at the pointofsale this provides certainty to the consumer who would traditionally not find out the exact cost of their transaction until some future unspecified date when the cardissuing bank did the currency conversion at some undisclosed exchange rate and reported that cost on the credit card statement often  days later in addition transactions converted by the cardissuing bank often result in international transaction fees imposed on the cardholder with the global average markup being between  and  percent this explains why  of consumers who are given the option to pay in their home currency accept at the pointofsale and the acceptance percentage tends to increase sharply as a merchants sales people gain confidence explaining the benefits of dcc to customers the companys multicurrency pricing service is geared toward ecommerce merchants seeking to increase

processing services customers have traditionally been based on a fixed percentage applied to the net foreign currency margin earned after deducting any merchant revenue and other contractual costs planets average gross markup has been  of which planet keeps  on average leaving the remainder to be split between the acquiring bank and merchant the primary drivers of revenue are the number of

customers and their merchants while providing end consumers with a superior service offering and payment certainty at the highest level planets solutions shift the financial benefit and revenue earned on the processing of international transactions to the acquiring banks and merchants from the historic beneficiaries the cardissuing banks acquiring banks  beneficiaries of planets solutions planets platform serves as an outsourced solution for acquiring banks that allows the provision of new revenueenhancing services without significant investment or modifications to existing systems historically acquiring banks have not shared in the revenue earned on the conversion of international credit card transactions they would instead only collect fees on the general processing of merchant transactions in connection with the merchants agreement with the acquirer offering planets multicurrency solutions provides acquiring banks a new revenue stream from collecting a share of the crosscurrency margin earned on processing crossborder transactions accordingly planets solutions provide the acquirer substantial incremental revenue and increase the profitability of the acquirers general credit card processing operations this incentivizes planets acquirer clients to sell their merchant bases on the benefits of adopting planets services driving as rapid an uptake as possible and reducing the necessity for the company to build out a large sales force further planets solutions provide the acquirer with an expanded product offering that acts as a powerful competitive differentiator and merchant retention tool merchants  beneficiaries of planets solutions the companys services also provide merchants with an additional profit center increase customer satisfaction and drive an increase in sales through price localization according to the green sheet to be able to see the value of transactions in home currencies makes dcc an enticement for foreigners to shop in businesses that offer dcc with pyc the merchant also earns a share of the revenue from the crosscurrency conversion additionally pyc eliminates the problem many customers experience due to currency fluctuations where the refund the cardholder receives is less than the original purchase price end consumer  beneficiaries of planets solutions planet payments dcc capability offers several benefits to cardholders in addition to knowing that the amount they see on the payment page is the amount they will pay ie no nasty surprises the cardholders often receive a more competitive rate on foreign exchange than that provided by their credit card issuing bank generally the cost attributable to dcc service is comparable to rates and fees that would have been paid had the card association and issuer performed the conversion the consumer enjoys the convenience of paying for a purchase in his or her home currency at generally the same cost that would have been applied throughout the traditional process also since conversion is done at the point of purchase cardholders are not subject to currency fluctuations which can occur over the period between the point of purchase and the conversion of the transaction by the cardholders issuing bank issuing banks  losers in the process issuing banks are being cut out in the process from participating in the fee stream from crosscurrency conversion because transactions are processed and received in the billing currency they do not earn the international transaction fee otherwise charged when a transaction is converted through the traditional process the issuing bank does continue to earn the interchange fee the percentage of each transaction that is collected by the card associations and paid to the issuer credit card association  neutral planet payments multicurrency processing solution is broadly revenueneutral to the credit card associations mastercard visa american express etc they continue to earn cross border transaction fees charged to the issuers and acquirers on the processing of crossborder transactions as a matter of fact the cross border transaction fees charged to acquirers which are typically passed on to merchants can provide a financial incentive for merchants to adopt planets solutions as the revenue derived from participation serve to offset these costs market traction planet typically partners with acquiring banks and processors which seamlessly integrate the companys solutions into their existing product offerings which are in turn marketed to merchants under the brand of the bank or processor through this model planet is winning the business of leading international banks and processors with  clients spanning more than  countries and territories some of its leading customers amongst banks and processors across various markets include the following planet also generates considerable revenue from its ipay payment gateway which provides merchants with payment applications and sophisticated fraud and business management tools it has attracted premier clients to adopting this service including the following • the weather channel • genzyme • nickelodeon junior • stratfor benefitting from strong industry tailwinds planet payment is operating in the center of the largest growth areas in international payment processing  international ecommerce and multicurrency processing continued shift toward electronic payment transactions the usage of electronic payments through credit and debit transactions has steadily taken market share from cash and checks in the past  years according to the nilson report a leading research provider for consumer payment information it is estimated that credit and debit transactions may account for  of all transactions in the us by  from a global perspective its estimated that total card spending will reach nearly  trillion by  with nearly  of the transactions occurring outside of the us and europe many large markets are still highly underpenetrated and growing not surprisingly the largest growth opportunities for planet payment continue to lie in the emerging markets according to the nilson report in  there were  billion payment cards in circulation in the us canada and europe those regions had a total population of  million representing  cards per person in the asia pacific region latin america the middle east and africa there was an average of only  cards per person another way of looking at the size of the opportunity for increasing card payments is to analyze the card purchase volume as a percentage of gdp for example brazils card purchase volume as a percent of gdp is only  whereas more developed economies are above  planet payment launched multicurrency processing services in singapore sri lanka the maldives brunei the philippines the united arab emirates and south africa in  with the results yielding strong results in  approximately  of the multicurrency settled dollar volume processed in december  was attributed to new merchants activated in  in march  the company announced it had entered into a contract to provide processing support across its platform for china unionpay credit and debit cards china unionpay is one of the worlds largest card brands with  billion cards issued worldwide chinese consumers were estimated to spend  billion overseas in  and china unionpay is one of the preferred payment options for chinese travelers it is expected this capability will be added to planets platform in the second quarter of  in october  planet announced an expansion into latin america the hiring of a regional vice president managing director and the establishment of a subsidiary and headquarters in mexico city planet payment currently has no revenues in latin america the fastest growing emerging market in terms of card payments the company has indicated that they are in discussions with a number of prospective customers in the region and anticipate announcing a contractual agreement in the near future the opportunity ahead in latin america is further illustrated below by the success of mercadolibres online payment service called mercadopago which is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the mercadolibre marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows users to securely easily and promptly send receive and finance payments online increased international commerce visa reported that for the  months ended march   crossborder payments and cash volume grew  yearoveryear on a constant us dollar basis mastercard reported that for the  months ended march   crossborder volume grew  periodoverperiod on a local currency basis increased ecommerce on a global scale with the rapid increase in the number of internet buyers worldwide competition among ecommerce merchants is growing and becoming more global and merchants must focus their resources on attracting consumers to their websites and making the buying decision as convenient and easy as possible growth in internet usage and ecommerce in particular has a direct link to increasing electronic payments the data compiled by the us census bureau indicates a steady growth profile in ecommerce retail sales over the past decade and now exceeds  billion per quarter however this still only represents a little more than  of all retail sales in the us on a global basis euromonitor international estimates a  increase in ecommerce sales by  internet penetration in emerging economies is still remarkably low at under  of the total population for countries such as india china and brazil but is growing at a rapid rate of  per annum management incentives tied to shareholder value creation the companys executive compensation plan provides a strong linkage between longterm corporate performance and shareholder returns for example on july   the company made a restricted stock grant of  shares of the companys common stock to the chief executive officer pursuant to its  longterm equity incentive plan the  shares vest in four separate tranches each with a different longterm performance goal the agreement provides that  upon a corporate transaction certain unvested shares accelerate and become vested and  upon mr becks involuntary termination certain unvested shares shall remain outstanding and become vested only at such time as the performance goals applicable to such unvested shares are satisfied the performance goals for each tranche are outlined below and give an indication of where the company believes the valuation and share price potential is headed over the next  years as part of the nasdaq ipo the company has adopted a new  equity incentive plan and has reserved an additional  million shares numerous investment highlights for planet payment scalable recurring revenue business model with significant operating leverage planet payment has a highmargin recurring revenue model customers sign contracts typically for    years and the company earns a fee every time a purchase is made across its network once planet breaks into a new geographic market its acquiring bank customers take charge in selling its platform to merchants in effect once the company gets traction it is ordertaking rather than selling because of this we believe selling general  administrative expense will grow at  of the companys revenue growth rate resulting in a growing percentage of revenue falling to the bottom line due to the scalability of the companys technology platform little is needed in incremental capital expenditure to support the companys growth we believe the company can support its growth at over the foreseeable future with  million in annual capital expenditure  million of which is dedicated toward new development and  million of which is maintenance spend significant network effects to drive sustainable topline growth once planet gets traction in a given geographic market acquirers not offering their merchant bases its services begin losing market share and increasingly seek to establish partnerships with the company to provide its services as planet signs up new merchants and market penetration deepens the company is able to demonstrate the benefits of its services to other merchants who may also want to implement its services planets business model benefits from powerful network effects as the company acquires more active merchants and users the value of its platform becomes more useful and valuable to all participants and prospects these network effects appear to be at an early stage of development and are likely to be a material growth driver in the future barriers to entry and scale creating a global payment platform requires significant domain knowledge and local expertise in each and every country and market planet payment has invested heavily in the past  years to build a secure robust and scalable platform the company has cemented strong relationships with the multiple parties required to successfully execute this business including acquiring banks processors and merchants see appendix  for a more detailed list of partners differentiated technology advantage planet payment has a differentiated technology platform the companys advanced payment processing services provide an endtoend solution for its customers when a merchant wishes to accept a payment using a payment card the company receives an authorization request from a merchants point of sale in real time they submit that transaction to the card associations for authorization by the card issuer upon receipt of an authorization or decline they return the message to the merchant which then completes the transaction with the cardholder currency transactions happen instantaneously under the companys patented rate markup technology other competitors do not have this capability and rely on the treasury method which pools transactions and settles them on a delayed basis and makes it more difficult to scale significant crossselling opportunities planet payment has untapped opportunities to crosssell its innovative services to acquiring banks processors and merchants its range of services and solutions enable crossselling opportunities that are intended to increase revenue from existing customers by helping them broaden their product sets with additional valueadd services customers have the ability to leverage the companys unified global platform and enhanced services to improve operational efficiency for example an existing customer for pay in your currency at the point of sale recently agreed to expand its use of the companys services to include pay in your currency at atms which is expected to launch in the second quarter of  crossselling opportunities are still at a very early stage of penetration and represent a significant incremental margin opportunity because there are lower customer acquisition and integration expenses swot analysis summary below we provide a traditional swot analysis to outline the major strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats facing planet payment on balance we believe the companys strengths and opportunities outweigh its threats and weaknesses attractive capital structure and institutional support planet payment has an attractive capital structure with only  million fully diluted shares and no financial debt planet payment has strong institutional shareholder support and significant insider stock ownership acquisition candidate in a rapidly consolidating industry planet payment is a leading independent payment processor with a fastgrowing high margin difficult to replicate multicurrency business as the key growth driver this gives it some scarcity value in an industry characterized by accelerating ma activity strategic acquirors have shown the willingness to pay high multiples relative to revenue ebitda and earnings for companies that have built their own processing platforms possess unique technologies and have acquired attractive customer bases this is because a differentiated payment processing platform is highly leverageable we believe acquirors are not just paying for a stream of profits but also a scalable technology platform to leverage larger transaction volumes and generate significantly more profits the table below lists transactions that have taken place in the industry over the past several years we believe it is most instructive to focus our analysis on less mature high margin targets that developed their own processing platforms and had unique hardtoreplicate technologies and to exclude from our analysis mature targets and those acting simply as merchant acquiring isos • in february  intuit bought electronic clearing house for  million or x ltm ebitda of  million echo owned its underlying processing technology this wasnt the first time an ecommerce company linked up with a payment processor in hopes of growth ebay purchased paypal in  for x ltm ebitda and saw its profits rise by creating an endtoend payment service for its customers intuit similarly expected to boost its revenue by collecting transaction fees every time someone makes a payment through its core software offering intuit announced that the deal provides intuit with access to a valuable list of new customers including large retail and hotel chains • in april  visa acquired cybersource for  billion or x ltm ebitda of  million cybersource is a payment gateway for online merchants the company owned a valuable processing platform with a deep list of big online merchants including home depot and google according to visa with cybersource we are adding a new suite of leading ecommerce capabilities and experience in addressing ecommerce merchant needs… online commerce continues to grow rapidly and this acquisition will enable visa to offer new and enhanced services that will better meet the growing demand among merchants globally… the acquisition of cybersource aligns with visas longterm strategic plan to identify and invest in opportunities today that will drive future growth… • in august  mastercard acquired datacash for  million or x ltm ebitda of  million datacash is an international provider of credit and debit card transaction processing and secure internet payments mastercard justified its purchase as follows ecommerce represents an important part of mastercards growth strategy and this acquisition will allow us to provide new services to our acquiring customers as well as drive increased ecommerce penetration in both existing and new markets the acquisition of datacash will expand our already significant ecommerce merchant gateway presence in asia and australia to european countries and other highgrowth emerging markets worldwide strategic acquirors pay top dollar for payment processors whose unique technologies they can leverage and use to grow their revenue streams they also place a high value on deep and extensive customer relationships through which they can crosssell services planets solutions are creating change in its industry shifting the balance of power from issuing banks to acquiring banks and processors and offering those institutions access to a piece of a very large potential profit stream we believe the company is positioning itself to be a part of a larger organization and that it will be an attractive acquisition candidate for many financial industry players in the next few years a strategic acquiror would be buying a highly flexible multicurrency payment processing platform and an attractive customer roster of large ecommerce merchants and leading international banks and processors and through them large international retail and hotel chains as history would suggest we believe this justifies valuation multiples at the upper end of the range for precedent transactions x evebitda x  x evsales and x  x priceeps valuation and price target we believe with a reasonable certainty that in light of the companys dominant competitive position and its growing market opportunity that planet can continue growing its top line at  per year for the next  years and at a much higher rate in the upside scenario should the company land very large international acquirer accounts or successfully leverage its platform to expand into other areas of processing if this takes place we expect a return of x from current trading levels and we believe the risks to our estimates are skewed toward the upside based on various valuation methodologies we believe planet today has a fair value of  per share our valuation is based on earnings projections spanning the next  years the companys stock price appears to undervalue the companys prospects and its impending ipo on the nasdaq may serve as a catalyst to unlock value from the current stock price comparable companies analysis given planets rapidly accelerating profitability it is difficult to justify the use of mature sector peers as a relative valuation tool however below we have included for reference an analysis of publicly traded companies in the financial transactions and processing sectors valuations range from x x forward pe x  x evebitda and x x evcash from operations planet appears rich based on these metrics but the companys unique position as a multicurrency processor with related data analytics and gateway operations makes a direct comparison with sector peers inadequate the following charts illustrate why investors appear to be placing a premium valuation on near term earnings the companys revenue and growth rates are the highest in the industry and it has an unlevered balance sheet and a return on invested capital comparable with its peers but set to surpass the average over the near term discounted cash flow analysis dcf using a traditional dcf analysis we arrive at our share price target of  by projecting unlevered free cash flows and applying an x  x terminal multiple to  ebitda based on the comparable companies and precedent transaction analyses our base case weighted average cost of capital wacc assumption is  given planet payments current share price of  we believe the stock is undervalued today and has significant room to appreciate as the company grows in the coming years nearterm ipo a potential catalyst for stock price in may  the company filed an amended s offering document to register shares for a listing on the nasdaq at the current time it appears the offering will be  million in size but it is still unclear what percentage of the offering will be newly issued shares vs shares being sold from existing investors jp morgan william blair  company and jefferies are listed as the leads of an bank underwriting syndicate for the offering several banks of this group are likely to follow the offering with research coverage of the company the nasdaq listing will provide greater liquidity for shareholders vs the existing otcqx listing and help to raise the visibility and profile of the company to new investors potentially serving as a powerful catalyst to unlock value from current trading levels conclusion planet payment has built a defensible business that is at the forefront of a nascent rapidly growing segment of the payment processing industry it has developed a unique processing technology platform that allows its customers to add a profit stream to their existing operations and as a result is deepening relationships with its client base of leading international banks and processors and rapidly attracting new sticky business these qualities make planet an attractive acquisition target in a rapidly consolidating industry we believe the company has a clear runway to continue growing revenue at  per annum over the next  years and that operating leverage will allow it to grow free cash flow at a much higher rate based on our analysis the equity has a fair value of  per share representing little risk of permanent capital impairment over a multiyear horizon from current trading levels its nearterm ipo and resultant exposure is likely to serve as a catalyst to drive the equity toward our fair value estimate disclosure i am long plpm additional disclosure please read the full legal disclaimer at the end of our  page report linked to in the introductory
