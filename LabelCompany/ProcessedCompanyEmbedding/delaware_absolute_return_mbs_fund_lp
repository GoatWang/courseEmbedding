the spotlight in this commentary paper new focus on mortgagebacked securities despite unsettled policy portfolio manager ion dan notes that an uncertain policy environment as well as reform of governmentsponsored entities looming on the horizon make the area of mbs potentially of special interest to investors download the paper now the views expressed represent the managers assessment of the market environment as of april  and should not be considered a recommendation to buy hold or sell any security and should not be relied on as research or investment advice views are subject to change without notice and may not reflect the managers views important risk considerations investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal past performance does not guarantee future results fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value and investors can lose principal as interest rates rise they also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt fixed income securities and bond funds may also be subject to prepayment risk the risk that the principal of a fixed income security that is held by the funds may be prepaid prior to maturity potentially forcing the funds to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate subscribe to insights thought leadership from our portfolio managers and

volatility may linger by ion dan july   in december  we wrote about our concerns our concerns our concerns around increasing liquidity risk within the fixed income markets here we build on those comments with a discussion of macro and micro liquidity and a look at current conditions like the growing microliquidity stress in the us treasury market — the perceived safe haven for all investors print options exit print options print page expand slideshow collapse slideshow the state of macro liquidity macro liquidity — or global aggregate monetary conditions — is the playing field of central banks macro liquidity is the result not only of the us federal reserves actions but the actions of central banks around the world when looking at the macro liquidity environment it is important to consider not just major central banks current monetary policies but also to assess what the most likely changes to those positions will be in the coming – months from this point of view the future for macro liquidity poses some troubles for investors the federal reserve and the bank of england are guiding toward a possible step back in monetary accommodation while the bank of japan and the european central bank are stepping up balance sheet expansion diverging central bank balance sheets as a percentage of gdp diverging central bank balance sheets as a percentage of gdp data bank for international settlements gross domestic product is a measurement of the total market value of the goods and services produced by a nations economy implications for market liquidity implications for market liquidity in april  the international monetary fund was warning investors about the implications for market liquidity as a result of changes in macro liquidity as us monetary policy normalizes the temporary boost to market liquidity provided by monetary accommodation will ebb revealing a changed capital market landscape without the buoyant liquidity provided by the fed the liquidityinhibiting impact of regulatory changes industry consolidation and other secular factors will likely become more pronounced markets could be increasingly susceptible to episodes in which liquidity suddenly vanishes and volatility spikes two recent price disruptions — the oct   volatility in us treasurys and the jan   surge in the swiss franc — involved an initial shock that was likely amplified by market makers’ withdrawal of liquidity support many of the factors responsible for lower market liquidity also appear to be exacerbating riskonriskoff market dynamics and increasing crossasset correlations during times of market stress these phenomena suggest that low market liquidity may act as a powerful amplifier of financial stability risks to the aforementioned episodes we can now add the recent repricing in german bunds in terms of magnitude velocity and time frame yields rose from  on april  to  on june  quite an impressive move in just  trading sessions data bloomberg market liquidity refers to the liquidity conditions in a single market and how easily one can buy and sell assets in that market generally the less liquidity the more buying and selling creates volatility in a single market an impressive move in year german yields an impressive move in year german yields data bloomberg german bunds long considered a safe haven experienced a notable drop in prices as investors became increasingly optimistic about economies around the world the resulting yield expansion happened quickly it was another example of limited liquidity having an outsized influence during a change in market sentiment with the deterioration in us treasury market depth micro liquidity concerns arise with the deterioration in us treasury market depth micro liquidity concerns arise market liquidity also exists at the security level and was the focus of concern in our december commentarycommentarycommentary as dealer inventories have diminished in most fixed income sectors it has become much more challenging to buy and sell large blocks of securities this is now starting to impact us treasurys the bastion of liquidity among all fixed income markets as risk appetites vacillate treasurys have become prone to significant price moves gaps in both directions — either when riskon positions are unwound or when investors want to reduce interest rate exposure as such volatility in treasurys has been increasing measured as the week rolling standard deviationaverage of year treasury yields rates volatility has picked up rates volatility has picked up as the uncertainty of the fed rate hike draws nearer implied volatility is perking up not only in treasurys but also in currencies as represented by the deutsche bank currency volatility index or

treasurys have been the cornerstone of the financial system as the safety asset of choice due to the depth of the market and its liquidity advantage if that is falling due to market positioning and regulation investors might demand a higher risk premium as compensation which will filter through to other asset classes potentially creating heightened volatility across the broader fixed income landscape this tendency toward higher volatility is troubling in and of itself but we think it could be amplified as we move along in  this is because markets will contend with additional volatility drivers that include continued mixed signals in us economic data increased concerns about political risks around the world uncertainty about the timing of the feds tightening of credit taken together we believe these circumstances will put a premium on managing risk as we address the challenges to come the specter of higher volatility will be folded into every step of our research process as we seek to position our portfolios to accommodate the increased possibility of market dislocations × slide disclosure data bloomberg the deutsche bank currency volatility index cvix measures expected

risks including market interest rate issuer credit inflation risk and liquidity risk the value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed investing in foreign denominated andor domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations and economic and political risks which may be enhanced in emerging markets mortgage and assetbacked securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates subject to early repayment risk and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market economic and industry conditions derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity interest rate market credit management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested diversification does not ensure against loss investments made by a fund and the
