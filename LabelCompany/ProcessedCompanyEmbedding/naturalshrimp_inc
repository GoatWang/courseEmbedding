shrimp key personnel technology ecofriendly enclosed system facility layout international investor relations documents blog chef’s corner contact us faq why should i choose naturalshrimp naturalshrimp is the first truly ecofriendly sustainable closed system production facility that produces the best tasting allnatural premium quality shrimp year round without the use of antibiotics or chemicalswhat kind of shrimp do you sell naturalshrimp produces and sells pacific white shrimp where do you grow your shrimp we currently grow and harvest our shrimp in la coste tx…located just west of san antonio  how are your shrimp grown naturalshrimp’s method is based on the natural cycle found in an ocean environment what’s different we eliminated many of the ocean’s hazards to create an indoor production environment that is free of predators weather hazards and chemicals naturallyfound proteins provide a continuous food source so shrimp can thrive without the use of harmful antibiotics present in other shrimp farming methods the result a closed biologically secure recirculating saltwater aquaculture system that produces safe fresh ecofriendly shrimp and since our saltwater process does not require access to the ocean soon you will find more naturalshrimp operations near major metropolitan areas to deliver delicious naturally produced shrimp directly to you  weeks a year how is natural shrimp ecofriendly shrimp harvested and sold by naturalshrimp has a virtually nonexistent environmental impact as compared to traditional methods the current preferred method of shrimp farmers around the world especially in third world countries utilize open air systems or manmade shrimp ponds connected to the open ocean open air systems are environmentally destructive have high chemical contamination levels and can foster widespread viral outbreaks that can wipe out an entire region’s shrimp production furthermore in order to maximize their crop farmers will use large quantities of antibiotics and dangerous levels of chemicals that pollute the oceans and in some cases make the shrimp they produce unsafe for human consumption wild shrimp is caught by the process of ocean trawling ocean trawling involves the use of large boat towed nets that are toxic to the undersea environment disturb oceanbottom ecosystems and catch a variety of nonshrimp sea life called bycatch which is usually killed and discarded as part of the shrimp harvesting process the naturalshrimp process does not deplete natural resources does not dump harmful chemicals into the ocean and does not use ocean trawlers that kill and dispose of unwanted bycatch marine life what is the difference between naturalshrimp and wild shrimp caught in the ocean most consumers are so used to that “iodine aftertaste” in shrimp that they don’t even notice it’s there…but it is and most everyone thinks you’re supposed to “smell” shrimp on your hands after you eat it the truth is that “iodine aftertaste” is actually bromine a chemical used in heavy duty cleansers that the shrimp eat when they’re in the ocean or in a regular openair shrimp farm furthermore mercury and other contaminants found in wild caught shrimp will not be found in naturalshrimp at naturalshrimp we don’t add chemicals when we say our shrimp is fresh and naturally grown we mean it while many openair shrimp farmers and wild fishers add sodium bisulfate to “prolong freshness” we refuse to do so is naturalshrimp “organic” the term “organic” is still being defined as it applies to aquaculture we feel we could achieve this coveted status…but we cannot claim an “organic” label until it has been defined however we do like to point out that our shrimp are “naturallygrown and sustainable which to many is a higher standard than organic and fed with a non gmo feed why is the naturalshrimp process the future of the shrimp industry shrimp is one of the most sought after seafood in the world and the oceans can only supply a finite amount of wild shrimp each year according to the usda foreign agricultural service the world consumes  billion pounds of shrimp annually with over  billion consumed in the united states alone and  billion pounds of shrimp are imported…most of it from asia approximately  of the global supply is provided by ocean trawlers which use large nets to catch their shrimp this process is destructive dangerous unsafe and unsustainable these nets are highly toxic since they disturb sensitive oceanbottom ecosystems and in the process catch a large variety of nonshrimp sea life bycatch which is typically killed and discarded as waste with global populations surpassing seven billion and domestic consumption growing from  to  annually it’s no wonder that global demand is outstripping the natural supply of wild caught shrimp this is clearly an unsustainable production paradigm naturalshrimp’s production facilities are the aquaculture industry’s first truly ecofriendly sustainable way of cultivating shrimp in a high density environment our closed system production method can produce fresh gourmet grade shrimp anywhere in the world without use of antibiotics pollutants and chemicals or without further depleting the world’s oceans from overfishing what chemicals are used by other shrimp farming methods one chemical found in shrimp farms especially those in asia is chloramphenicol this is a very strong antibiotic that is used to control widespread disease in high density shrimp farms this chemical is banned in the us because of its potentially lethal side effects other chemicals banned by the us food and drug administration include malachite green fluoroquinolones nitrofurans and gentian violet how does naturalshrimp achieve a safe high density growing environment for its shrimp without antibiotics probiotics and other chemicals the complete answer is a company trade secret however part of our success is a result of our proprietary vibrio suppression technology this technology helps to protect our shrimp population from harmful organisms additionally our computer monitoring system maintains proper levels of oxygen salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp
