categorical funding programs to serve special need populations among school age children including handicapped educationally disadvantaged bilingual and vocational education students examines the literature on costs of categorical programs and presents an alternative framework for addressing the problem a cost based funding approach is advocated which would provide equal access to educational resources across local districts serving similar student populations the model also makes provisions for systematic differences in access to resources to districts serving special populations it is explained as an approach which gives policy makers a basis to examine cost savings in trade offs among resources and programs applications of the resource cost model are presented along with a section on the step by step process of constructing a cost estimate in a hypothetical school district a final section addresses equity and efficiency issues of the model cl local special education planning

finance reform and special education finance issues is presented in this paper it describes a general model of the educational finance system in which state and federal general and categorical aid combines with district fiscal capacity to determine educational expenditures which in turn affect educational programs and in consequence educational outcomes school finance reform activities are then reviewed and the general model is used to highlight the aspects of the system at which reform efforts are being targeted and to make explicit the critical assumptions of the reform proposals finally the special education finance subsystem is cast in terms of the educational finance model and the relationship of special education finance to general school finance is investigated particular attention is paid to the effects of recent changes in special education laws and to those areas in which additional study is needed authorjeh budget allocation patterns among school districts of varying fiscal constraint by william t hartman book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide to investigate school districts responses to fiscal constraint this study examined the relationship between districts expenditures per student and allocations of funds to instructional support and administrative costs budget allocations as indicators of the districts priorities were compared for  and  in  oregon school districts whose fiscal situations varied widely the findings indicate that when fiscal constraint was greatest priority was given to instruction over other budget categories and to personnel over other objects of expenditure as constraint diminished larger shares of budgets were allocated to administration and to capital outlay surprisingly however the school districts in the sample generally did not experience fiscal constraint none of them had actual budget reductions and both total expenditures and expenditures per student grew substantially in real dollars dispite oregons severe recession finally although the sample districts had reduced the number of teachers they had increased their total instructional staffs and decreased the studentinstructional personnel ratio by adding less expensive instructional aides authormcg impact and analysis of act  by william t hartman book  edition published in  in english

potential national costs of implementing federally mandated special education services are discussed in this paper a resourcecost model is utilized in which student characteristics and program configurations form the basis for estimating the costs of special education the procedures require specification of the student population to be served description of the instructional programs and services to be offered and the resources that comprise each program and determination of the cost of each resource the distribution of students across the programs and the studentpersonnel ratios of the programs the paper describes a study in which detailed student and program specifications from  states and national sources were obtained to identify the variables that have the largest impact on costs and to show the effects of uncertainty associated with each variable authorjeh estimating the costs of educating handicapped children  a resourcecost model approach  summary report by william t hartman book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the purpose of this study was to develop an appropriate methodology and use it to estimate the costs of providing appropriate special education programs and services for all schoolaged handicapped children in the us in  a resourcecost model approach was selected based on a mathematical formulation of the relationships among students programs resources and decision rules involved in the special education process data from  states concerning current and expected programming practices and characteristics of the handicapped population formed the data base to operate the resourcecost model results showed the most likely estimate of special education costs for all schoolaged handicapped children in  to be  billion extremes of the high  billion and low  billion estimates indicated the critical importance of program decisions the paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications and uses of both the resourcecost methodology and the cost estimates together with future research questions suggested by the study authorld policy effects of special education funding formulas by william t hartman book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide measures of wealth in pennsylvania by kenneth j dady  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the measure of district wealth used by a state is a critical factor in reducing the potential extremes in available resources that may occur across districts to be effective the state definition of wealth should correlate closely with the local tax structure that is available to school districts to raise local revenues conversely if wealth is measured improperly state aid could be distributed in ways that create or exacerbate disparities in per pupil spending the purpose of this study is to identify measures of wealth that are feasible for state school finance systems and examine the impact of alternative definitions of wealth on distribution of state aid to school districts and on the fiscal equity in the school finance system pennsylvania and its  school districts were used to illustrate the possible measures of wealth and to test their potential application in practice pennsylvania conducted a costing out study that changed the formula that was used to distribute state funding to schools equity measures from this study illustrate that the concept of equity based on equal spending is outdated in pa the objective of the current system of funding in pennsylvania is to achieve adequacy the adequacy target established for each district has identified a figure that the state determines to be the amount it takes for districts to achieve similar results the system does not focus on equalizing spending as much as it is focusing on equalizing outcomes wealth measures used in the mvpi ar now have little impact on funding in pa the findings of this study indicate that even when relying on the wealth measure that produces the most favorable funding outcome for each district the change in funding in those
