momentumshareholdersunitesummarymagnachip semiconductor is already recovering but we see considerable mileage in that stillthe company produced solid q figures despite some temporary headwindsit has longerrun tailwinds from restructuring amoled and analog based power solutionswe think there are numerous reasons why you could do worse than buying shares in magnachip semiconductor mx good quarter despite some headwinds restructuring longerterm tailwinds from oled and analog technology in power management valuation magnachip is an interesting company producing its own chips but also acting as a foundry for third parties after a rough patch as a result of accounting restatements the company is getting its act together and things are looking up the above figure shows that the first quarter of this year was particularly good but thats not all the company expects things to get better good quarter this was a really solid quarter in which eps of  beats by  revenue m increased  yy a small beat by m adjusted ebitda increased to m up  from the first quarter a year ago  million in cash on the balance sheet up more than  million from the prior quarter gross margin of  and adjusted ebitda margin of  in q both at their highest levels in four years since q  its fab utilization rate reached a low s foundry revenue  of total revenue in the first quarter was m up  this was the best quarter for quite a while but there were some tailwinds in the form of a net foreign currency gain of m m for q a year ago this was due to the appreciation of the korean won relative to the us dollar a substantial portion of this is a noncash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany longterm loans to the korean subsidiary this is the main reason gaap earnings  per diluted share were much larger than the nongaap equivalent  per diluted share so it doesnt feature in the latter which is the headline figure however there are also some headwinds accounts receivable was m in q up sequentially from m at the end of q  and as compared with m at the end of the first quarter  here is management explaining during the qcc the increase in accounts receivable was part of a deliberate and strategic financial decision to limit the practice of offering discounts to customers in exchange for early payments the reason the company did cut out these discounts is that its cash position is a lot better now other headwinds are a seasonal slowdown in oled drivers and some unfortunate mismatch in products which well discuss below it will be interesting to see how this variable is developing in subsequent quarters restructuring the company is making most decisions on the basis of increasing margins and profitability closing down lossmaking lines and products and reducing headcount for instance the company sold its sensor business which was carrying a negative operating margin and closed a legacy inch fab last year and sold its building and equipment for m it is also reducing headcount which it expects to finish in q reducing it by over twice the  reduction which was  leading to an annual saving of mm boosting margins the associated costs are mm of which m has already been incurred in q and there will be only mm left of that for q below we see that the fruits of these efforts are materializing albeit slowly gross margin already at multiple level highs is expected to increase further in  management guides it to  for q and in q and q its temporary amoled market funk will recover see below giving it another likely boost revenues are expected to be between m and m in q tailwinds as other sa contributors have pointed out tailwinds arrive from the oled market the company is the second largest amoled supplier in the world and is working with the top two amoled panel manufacturers in the world likely to be lg and samsung otcssnlf which are expected to produce most of the amoled panels in the world in the next two years per qcc amoled panels are advancing rapidly in mobile even the new iphones are rumored to switch to amoled and also in tvs they might even make some inroads into computer screens and laptops although that is less certain apart from the growth prospects one has to realize that amoled carries above company average margins as well it also has increased flexibility as it can source amoled from other foundries from the qcc we secured design wins from smartphone makes in china and increased wafer starts from our external foundry to meet an anticipated increase in amoled demand in the second half of the year however in q and probably also in q these have turned temporarily into headwinds due to seasonality and a timing mismatch with the amoled display driver ics demand for older products tapering off without the newer ones being ready for mass production this produced a substantial decline of  sequentially but the company expects these factors to wane and in q sequential growth will resume when volume production from its recent design wins will start on the basis of two new products the  nanometer flexible amoled display driver ic that allows curved edgetoedge design which has been sampled in q and the  nanometer driver ic that the company is going to sample this month but it has a second tailwind from the qcc overall we are upbeat about the longerterm prospects for our foundry business because we are riding the industry wave and the broad adoption of analog based power solution for a whole range of applications the growing importance of analog technology in power management can be traced to the explosive rise of mobile devices that require low power to extend battery life reduce heat improve product reliability and conserve energy likewise power hungry data centers factories automobiles and large screen tvs are big users of power solutions analog technology eeprom and mixedsignal are core competencies are magnachip as an example our bcd process which combines bipolar cmos and dmos is pure analog an ideal for power applications we may be the only foundry able to combine bcd technology with ee technology in a single process node at  micron and we believe we have one of the smallest ee cell in  micron in the business indeed revenue from bcd and ee technology rose  sequentially in q and a whopping  as compared to q  one thing investors should realize is that being in the analog business really isnt the same as digital in terms of required capex because the analog fabs can continue to produce for decades rather than years valuation at present the company has a market cap of m m in cash and m in longterm debt giving it an ev of m sa contributor anthony thorpe produced a very helpful analysis at the start of the year in which he argued ebitda could reach m this year well q already produced m of that and as we argued above things are likely to improve in the second half so we could quite zoom past that m mark in a meaningful way he also argued that most semiconductor companies sell for xx sales which is a much bigger multiple that magna is currently selling for just  its ps valuation has recovered from the lows but is still half of what it was in  before the accounting restatement evsales have recovered a bit more conclusion the shares can enjoy further impetus when the benefits rather than the severance costs of the headcount reductions and other cost cutting efforts exert themselves and the companys new amoled products gear up for mass production in the second half were unlikely to have seen the highs in these shares disclosure i amwe are long mx

already recovering but we see considerable mileage in that stillthe company produced solid q figures despite some temporary headwindsit has longerrun tailwinds from restructuring amoled and analog based power solutionswe think there are numerous reasons why you could do worse than buying shares in magnachip semiconductor mx good quarter despite some headwinds restructuring longerterm tailwinds from oled and analog technology in power management valuation magnachip is an interesting company producing its own chips but also acting as a foundry for third parties after a rough patch as a result of accounting restatements the company is getting its act together and things are looking up the above figure shows that the first quarter of this year was particularly good but thats not all the company expects things to get better good quarter this was a really solid quarter in which eps of  beats by  revenue m increased  yy a small beat by m adjusted ebitda increased to m up  from the first quarter a year ago  million in cash on the balance sheet up more than  million from the prior quarter gross margin of  and adjusted ebitda margin of  in q both at their highest levels in four years since q  its fab utilization rate reached a low s foundry revenue  of total revenue in the first quarter was m up  this was the best quarter for quite a while but there were some tailwinds in the form of a net foreign currency gain of m m for q a year ago this was due to the appreciation of the korean won relative to the us dollar a substantial portion of this is a noncash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany longterm loans to the korean subsidiary this is the main reason gaap earnings  per diluted share were much larger than the nongaap equivalent  per diluted share so it doesnt feature in the latter which is the headline figure however there are also some headwinds accounts receivable was m in q up sequentially from m at the end of q  and as compared with m at the end of the first quarter  here is management explaining during the qcc the increase in accounts receivable was part of a deliberate and strategic financial decision to limit the practice of offering discounts to customers in exchange for early payments the reason the company did cut out these discounts is that its cash position is a lot better now other headwinds are a seasonal slowdown in oled drivers and some unfortunate mismatch in products which well discuss below it will be interesting to see how this variable is developing in subsequent quarters restructuring the company is making most decisions on the basis of increasing margins and profitability closing down lossmaking lines and products and reducing headcount for instance the company sold its sensor business which was carrying a negative operating margin and closed a legacy inch fab last year and sold its building and equipment for m it is also reducing headcount which it expects to finish in q reducing it by over twice the  reduction which was  leading to an annual saving of mm boosting margins the associated costs are mm of which m has already been incurred in q and there will be only mm left of that for q below we see that the fruits of these efforts are materializing albeit slowly gross margin already at multiple level highs is expected to increase further in  management guides it to  for q and in q and q its temporary amoled market funk will recover see below giving it another likely boost revenues are expected to be between m and m in q tailwinds as other sa contributors have pointed out tailwinds arrive from the oled market the company is the second largest amoled supplier in the world and is working with the top two amoled panel manufacturers in the world likely to be lg and samsung otcssnlf which are expected to produce most of the amoled panels in the world in the next two years per qcc amoled panels are advancing rapidly in mobile even the new iphones are rumored to switch to amoled and also in tvs they might even make some inroads into computer screens and laptops although that is less certain apart from the growth prospects one has to realize that amoled carries above company average margins as well it also has increased flexibility as it can source amoled from other foundries from the qcc we secured design wins from smartphone makes in china and increased wafer starts from our external foundry to meet an anticipated increase in amoled demand in the second half of the year however in q and probably also in q these have turned temporarily into headwinds due to seasonality and a timing mismatch with the amoled display driver ics demand for older products tapering off without the newer ones being ready for mass production this produced a substantial decline of  sequentially but the company expects these factors to wane and in q sequential growth will resume when volume production from its recent design wins will start on the basis of two new products the  nanometer flexible amoled display driver ic that allows curved edgetoedge design which has been sampled in q and the  nanometer driver ic that the company is going to sample this month but it has a second tailwind from the qcc overall we are upbeat about the longerterm prospects for our foundry business because we are riding the industry wave and the broad adoption of analog based power solution for a whole range of applications the growing importance of analog technology in power management can be traced to the explosive rise of mobile devices that require low power to extend battery life reduce heat improve product reliability and conserve energy likewise power hungry data centers factories automobiles and large screen tvs are big users of power solutions analog technology eeprom and mixedsignal are core competencies are magnachip as an example our bcd process which combines bipolar cmos and dmos is pure analog an ideal for power applications we may be the only foundry able to combine bcd technology with ee technology in a single process node at  micron and we believe we have one of the smallest ee cell in  micron in the business indeed revenue from bcd and ee technology rose  sequentially in q and a whopping  as compared to q  one thing investors should realize is that being in the analog business really isnt the same as digital in terms of required capex because the analog fabs can continue to produce for decades rather than years valuation at present the company has a market cap of m m in cash and m in longterm debt giving it an ev of m sa contributor anthony thorpe produced a very helpful analysis at the start of the year in which he argued ebitda could reach m this year well q already produced m of that and as we argued above things are likely to improve in the second half so we could quite zoom past that m mark in a meaningful way he also argued that most semiconductor companies sell for xx sales which is a much bigger multiple that magna is currently selling for just  its ps valuation has recovered from the lows but is still half of what it was in  before the accounting restatement evsales have recovered a bit more conclusion the shares can enjoy further impetus when the benefits rather than the severance costs of the headcount reductions and other cost cutting efforts exert themselves and the companys new amoled products gear up for mass production in the second half were unlikely to have seen the highs in these shares disclosure i amwe are long mx i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving

is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have seen  annual returns on average
