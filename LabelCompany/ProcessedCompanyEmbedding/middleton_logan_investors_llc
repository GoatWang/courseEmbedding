price as it hunts for the precious metal in utah and nevada last year it struck an option deal with pilot gold inc whereby it can evaluate nine advanced exploration projects in these mining friendly areas and earn a participating interest of up to  on four of them it can take on one two or all of them   its up to the company it has a wealth of former data to look at and  is also embarking on its own exploration once completed logan can earn a  interest in any project selected by spending usmln in the first  months and by issuing shares it can later earn up to  the investment case mark morabito chief executive has told proactive the firm offered low downside risk and unlimited upside potential if you believe in gold and youre going to take a position that gold has good upside from this point the downside risk in logan at the current share price of  cents canadian is almost nothing and the upside is somewhat unlimited in case any of these prospective projects in utah and nevada hit and then we have a nice little insurance policy with our exposure to the uranium space he said the projects the nine usa projects the firm is considering are brik drum griffon  antelope  easter sandy anchor viper stateline all have seen previous work and brik in nevada has been selected as a priority target as previous gold has been identified near surface another project called drum is adjacent to a former mine which produced  ounces at an average grade of gt grams per ton of the yellow metal and where permits have been submitted for drilling this year griffon also in nevada is a past producing open pit heap leach that produced over  ounces at an average  grade of gt and exposure to uranium logan also has a  carried interest in the gorilla lake property in the western

drilling success and owns  work at the  acre site includes a fourhole diamond drilling program for around  metres  alx uranium corp  began drilling in february this year the uranium space has been on its knees since  and the fukushima daiichi disaster but there are now signs of life in the market not least due a production cut in kazakhstan and this project is set to be a beneficiary of any upswing recent progress is clear and recent progress has been clear the group is now set to generate drill targets after it completing its review of the database concerning one property   its angel wing claims in nevada it comes after it inked a mining lease and purchase option agreement over the claims  effectively consolidating the greater part of the viper district  and therefore its viper project   an earlystage lowsulphidation epithermal gold target it has now kicked off the drill program at its antelope gold project the work is designed to confirm the results from selected historic drill holes and to test the northwest extension of nearsurface mineralization in all the reverse circulation rc program will total around  meters in  to  holes and last month may it begin preparation work on a second phase of drilling on the brik property in lincoln county nevada the plan is for a total of approximately m in  core holes to be carried out in the summer and autumn phase one drilling comprises eight reversecirculation rc holes at the hidden treasure target area phase  will target hidden treasure again and also sinter and maui wash six holes have been designed within and adjacent to the main mineralized zone at hidden treasure and two holes have been designed each at sinter and maui wash looking ahead morabito said earlier this year that newsflow will include more results and more drilling as it hones down the focus on which property or properties to concentrate on we have a great project portfolio and a great team of experienced geologists and i think the macro backdrop is also very favorable so im looking forward to it very much he said   top stories cobalt price surge may be signpost to boom as electric vehicles begin to suck in supply theralase technologies shares
