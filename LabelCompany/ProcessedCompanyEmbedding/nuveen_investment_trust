approach to dividend investing goldman sachs utilizes a forward looking methodology to identify stocks of european companies with the potential for both growth and sustainability of dividend yields considering a variety of factors including forecasted dividend payout ratios free cash flow levels debt to earnings ratios forecasted dividend growth analyst ratings msci europe index performance by dividend policy copyright  ned davis research inc further distribution prohibited without prior permission all rights reserved see ndr disclaimer at wwwndrcomcopyrighthtml for data vendor disclaimers refer to wwwndrcomvendorinfo past performance is no guarantee of future results indices are statistical composites and index performance does not include any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase securities that may be compared to the index it is not possible to invest directly in an index there is no assurance that any asset class or index will provide positive performance over time the holdings of the unit trust may differ from those in the indices the chart illustrates the cumulative historical performance of the msci europe index and its member constituents grouped into hypothetical subindices according to dividend policy as determined and calculated by ned davis research inc starting at a base value of  the performance of the msci europe index and each hypothetical subindex is determined by the monthly arithmetically equalweighted gross total returns assuming gross dividend reinvestment in usd with monthly rebalancing the chart plots the equity lines for dividend payers dividend nonpayers dividend growers dividend cutters and dividend payers with no change in dividends as defined by ned davis research inc dividend payers are companies that reported a dividend dividend nonpayers are companies that have not reported a dividend dividend growers are companies that increased their dividend dividend cutters are companies that decreased their dividend by at least  dividend payers with no change in dividends are companies that paid a dividend but were not considered a grower or cutter the dividend policy is determined using dividends paid over the prior month period ned davis research first looks to use gross dividends reported if gross dividends are not provided ned davis research then uses net dividends reported all dividend values are adjusted historically for currency changes so that a switch in reported currency will not alter the dividend policy of the company principal investment strategy the trust seeks to achieve its objective by attempting to substantially replicate the goldman sachs europe high sustainable dividend basket an approximately sectorneutral basket which includes  stocks selected from the msci europe

determine whether msci’s permission is required under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with msci without the prior written permission of msci the basket is not sponsored endorsed sold or promoted by msci and msci does not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in the securities security selectioninvestment goals goldman sachs aims to identify stocks of companies that have dividend yields which are both high and sustainable by screening the constituents of the msci europe index based upon the filters below the companies that remain are then ranked based on their expected dividend yield within their respective sector methodology  size  liquidity filter removes stocks of companies with a price history of less than six calendar months a

of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings economic recession currency fluctuations changing consumer tastes extensive competition product liability litigation and increased government regulation investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the united states this may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries us or foreign tax treatment and the potential lack of liquidity government supervision and regulation the trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in europe and therefore is subject to certain risks associated specifically with europe european union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the european central bank furthermore the european sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had and continues to have a significant negative impact on the economies of certain european countries and their future economic outlooks   stocks of midcap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
