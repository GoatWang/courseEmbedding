        delaware law does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares however the listing requirements of the nyse which apply for so long as our class a common stock is listed on the nyse require stockholder approval of certain issuances other than a public offering equal to or exceeding  of the then outstanding voting power or then outstanding number of shares of class a common stock as well as for certain issuances of stock in compensatory transactions these additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes including future public offerings to raise additional capital or to facilitate acquisitions one of the effects of the existence of unissued and unreserved class a common stock may be to enable our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise and thereby protect the continuity of our management and possibly deprive the stockholders of opportunities to sell their shares of class a common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices antitakeover effects of certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws         certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which are summarized in the following paragraphs may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders undesignated preferred stock         the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us or otherwise effect a change in control of us these and other provisions may have the effect of deferring delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers or changes in

consent         the dgcl permits stockholder action by written consent unless otherwise provided by our certificate of incorporation our certificate of incorporation precludes stockholder action by written consent advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations         our bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors in order for any matter to be properly brought before a meeting a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information our bylaws allow the presiding officer at a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings which may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed         these provisions may defer delay or discourage a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company removal of directors vacancies         our certificate of incorporation provides that directors may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition our bylaws provide that any newlycreated directorship on the board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring

financial benefit to the interested stockholder subject to various exceptions an interested stockholder is a person who together with his or her affiliates and associates owns or within three years

on liability and indemnification of officers and directors         the dgcl authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except  for breach of duty of loyalty  table of contents  for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law  under section  of the dgcl unlawful dividends or  for transactions from which the director derived improper personal benefit         our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the dgcl we are also expressly authorized to and do carry directors and officers insurance providing coverage for our directors officers and certain employees for some liabilities we believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers         the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty these provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers even though such an action if successful might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders in addition your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions         we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers providing for additional indemnification protection beyond that provided by the directors and officers liability insurance policy in the indemnification agreements we have agreed subject to certain exceptions to indemnify and hold harmless the director or officer

being beneficially owned by fewer than  persons and ii any person from beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock if such ownership would result in us failing to qualify as a reit         these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock over the then prevailing market price or which stockholders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest         certain existing stockholders that currently hold in excess of  of the value of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock are exempt from the ownership limitations in our certificate of incorporation

subject to tax as a reit commencing with our taxable year ended december   we believe that commencing with such taxable year we have been organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the applicable provisions of the code we intend to continue to operate in such a manner to continue to qualify for taxation as a reit         the law firm of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp has acted as our tax counsel in connection with our election to be taxed as a reit we have received an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp to the effect that commencing with our taxable year ending december   we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code and that our actual method of operation has enabled us and our proposed method of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit it must be emphasized that the opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp is based on various assumptions relating to our organization and operation and is conditioned upon factbased representations and covenants made by our management regarding our organization assets and income and the present and future conduct of our business operations while we intend to operate so that we will qualify as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances no assurance can be given by skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp or by us that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year the opinion was expressed as of the date issued skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp has no obligation to advise us or our stockholders of any

assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions         our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis through actual operating results distribution levels and diversity of stock and asset ownership various qualification requirements imposed upon reits by the code the compliance with which will not be reviewed by skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp our ability to qualify as a reit also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination accordingly no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit taxation of reits in general         as indicated above our qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis various qualification requirements imposed upon reits by the code the material qualification requirements are summarized below under requirements for qualificationgeneral while we intend to operate so that we qualify as a reit no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge our qualification or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the reit requirements in the future see failure to qualify         provided that we qualify as a reit we will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore will not be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation in general the income that we generate is taxed only at the stockholder level upon a distribution of dividends to our stockholders         currently most us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are taxed on corporate dividends at a maximum regular us federal income tax rate of  with limited exceptions however dividends from us or from other entities that are taxed as reits are generally not eligible for  table of contents this rate and will continue to be taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income under current law the highest marginal

tax credits and other tax attributes generally do not pass through to our stockholders subject to special rules for certain items such as the capital gains that we recognize see taxation of stockholderstaxation of taxable us holdersdistributions provided we qualify as a reit we will nonetheless be subject to us federal tax in the following circumstances  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed net taxable income including undistributed net capital gain  we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference including any deductions of net operating losses  if we have net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than foreclosure property such income will be subject to a  tax see prohibited transactions and foreclosure property below  if we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as foreclosure property we may thereby avoid the  tax on gain from a resale of that property if the sale would otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction but the income from the sale or operation of the property may be subject to us federal corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate currently   if we fail to satisfy the  gross income test or the  gross income test as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because we satisfy other requirements we will be subject to a  tax on an amount based on the magnitude of the failure as adjusted to reflect the profit margin associated with our gross income  if we violate the asset tests other than certain de minimis violations or other requirements applicable to reits as described below and yet maintain our qualification as a reit because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met we may be subject to a penalty tax in that case the amount of the penalty tax will be at least  per failure and in the case of certain asset test failures will be determined as the amount of net income generated by the assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate currently  if that amount exceeds  per failure  if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i  of our reit ordinary income for such year ii  of our reit capital gain net income for such year and iii any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods we will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of a the amounts that we actually distributed and b the amounts we retained and upon which we paid income tax at the corporate level  we may be required to pay monetary penalties to the irs in certain circumstances including if we fail to meet recordkeeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a reits stockholders as described below in requirements for qualificationgeneral  a  tax may be imposed on transactions between us and a taxable reit subsidiary trs that do not reflect armslength terms  if we sell any of our existing appreciated assets or if we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a reit ie a corporation taxable under subchapter c of the code in a  table of contents transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the subchapter c corporation we may be subject to tax on such appreciation at the highest us federal corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the fiveyear period following their acquisition from the subchapter c corporation  the earnings of our trss will be subject to us federal corporate income tax to the extent that such subsidiaries are subchapter c corporations         in addition we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of other taxes including payroll taxes and state local and foreign income property and other taxes on our assets and operations we could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated requirements for qualificationgeneral         the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association  that is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for its election to be subject to tax as a reit  that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by  or more persons  in which during the last half of each taxable year not more than  in value of the outstanding stock is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include specified taxexempt entities and  that meets other tests described below including with respect to the nature of its income and assets         the code provides that conditions  through  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition  must be met during at least  days of a taxable year of  months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year conditions  and  need not be met during a corporations initial tax year as a reit which in our case was  our certificate of incorporation provides restrictions regarding the ownership and transfers of our stock which are intended to assist us in satisfying the stock ownership requirements described in conditions  and  above         to monitor compliance with the stock ownership requirements we generally are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our stock to do so we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock pursuant to which the record holders must disclose the actual owners of the stock ie the persons required to include our dividends in their gross income we must maintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records we could be subject to monetary penalties if we fail to comply with these recordkeeping requirements if you fail or refuse to comply with the demands you will be required by treasury regulations to submit a statement with your tax return disclosing your actual ownership of our stock and other information         in addition a corporation generally may not elect to become a reit unless its taxable year is the calendar year we adopted december  as our yearend and thereby satisfy this requirement  table of contents effect of subsidiary entities         ownership of partnership interests     we are a partner in entities that are treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes eg directly in our series reit operating partnership and indirectly through our trs in our series trs operating partnership treasury regulations provide that we are deemed to own our proportionate share of our series reit operating partnerships assets and to earn our proportionate share of such partnerships income for purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to reits our proportionate share of our series reit operating partnerships assets and income is based on our capital interest in the partnership except that for purposes of the  value test described below our proportionate share of the partnerships assets is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership in addition the assets and gross income of the partnership are deemed to retain the same character in our hands thus our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any of our subsidiary partnerships generally will be treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the reit requirements         we generally have control of our operating partnerships and the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies and intend to operate them in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a reit if we become a limited partner or nonmanaging member in any partnership or limited liability company and such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a reit or require us to pay tax we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity in addition it is possible that a partnership or limited liability company could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis in that case we could fail to qualify as a reit unless we were entitled to relief as described below         disregarded subsidiaries     if we own a corporate subsidiary that is a qualified reit subsidiary that subsidiary is generally disregarded for us federal income tax purposes and all of the subsidiarys assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit are treated as our assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to reits a qualified reit subsidiary is any corporation other than a trs as described below that is directly or indirectly whollyowned by a reit other entities that are whollyowned by us including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for us federal income tax purposes are also generally disregarded as separate entities for us federal income tax purposes including for purposes of the reit income and asset tests disregarded subsidiaries along with any partnerships in which we hold an equity interest are sometimes referred to herein as passthrough subsidiaries         in the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be whollyownedfor example if any equity interest in the subsidiary is acquired by a person other than us or another disregarded subsidiary of oursthe subsidiarys separate existence would no longer be disregarded for us federal income tax purposes instead the subsidiary would have multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation such an event could depending on the circumstances adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income requirements applicable to reits including the requirement that reits generally may not own directly or indirectly more than  of the securities of another corporation see asset tests and income tests         taxable subsidiaries     in general we may jointly elect with a subsidiary corporation whether or not whollyowned including a corporation owned by our operating partnership to treat such subsidiary corporation as a trs we generally may not own more than  of the securities of a taxable corporation as measured by voting power or value unless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation as a trs the separate existence of a trs or other taxable corporation is not ignored for us federal income tax purposes accordingly a trs or other taxable subsidiary corporation generally  table of contents is subject to us federal corporate income tax on its earnings which may reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate and may reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders         we are not treated as holding the assets of a trs or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary earns rather the stock issued by a taxable subsidiary to us is an asset in our hands and we treat the dividends paid to us from such taxable subsidiary if any as income this treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations as described below because we do not include the assets and income of trss or other taxable subsidiary corporations on a lookthrough basis in determining our compliance with the reit requirements we may use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the reit rules might otherwise preclude us from doing directly or through passthrough subsidiaries for example we may use trss or other taxable subsidiary corporations to perform services or conduct activities that give rise to certain categories of income such as management fees or to conduct activities that if conducted by us directly would be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions         the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation further the rules impose a  excise tax on transactions between a trs and its parent reit or the reits tenants that are not conducted on an armslength basis we intend that all of our transactions with our trss if any will be conducted on an armslength basis income tests         to qualify as a reit we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis first at least  of our gross income for each taxable year excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in prohibited transactions discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions generally must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property including certain types of mortgagebacked securities rents from real property dividends received from other reits and gains from the sale of real property mortgages on real property and shares in other reits as well as specified income from temporary investments second at least  of our gross income in each taxable year excluding gross income from prohibited transactions discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the  gross income test described above as well as other dividends interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities which need not have any relation to real property income and gain from certain hedging transactions will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of both the  and  gross income tests         interest income     interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the  gross income test as described above to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property if we receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan the interest income will generally be apportioned between the real property and the other collateral and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the  gross income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property see interest and remic apportionment even if a loan is not secured by real property or is undersecured such that all or a portion of the interest thereon does not qualify for the  gross income test the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the  gross income test  table of contents         we may invest in agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities that are either mortgage passthrough certificates or cmos we expect that such mortgagebacked securities will be treated either as interests in a grantor trust or as interests in a real estate mortgage investment conduit or a remic for us federal income tax purposes in the case of mortgagebacked securities treated as interests in grantor trusts we would be treated as owning an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the mortgage loans held by the grantor trust the interest on such mortgage loans would be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test to the extent that the obligation is secured by real property as discussed above in the case of mortgagebacked securities treated as interests in a remic income derived from remic interests will generally be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income tests if less than  of the assets of the remic are real estate assets however then only a proportionate part of our interest in the remic and income derived from the interest will qualify for purposes of the  gross income test in addition some remic securitizations include imbedded interest swap or cap contracts or other derivative instruments that potentially could produce nonqualifying income for the holder of the related remic securities we expect that substantially all of our income from mortgagebacked securities will be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests         dividend income     we may directly or indirectly receive distributions from trss or other corporations that are not reits or qualified reit subsidiaries these distributions generally are treated as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation such distributions will generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but not for purposes of the  gross income test any dividends that we receive from a reit however will be qualifying income for purposes of both the  and  gross income tests         interest and remic apportionment     the interest apportionment tax rules generally provide that if a mortgage is secured by both real property and other property the reit is required to apportion its annual interest income between the portion attributable to a mortgage on the real property and the portion attributable to other property which is not treated as mortgage interest the interest apportionment tax regulations apply only if the mortgage loan in question is secured by both real property and other property we expect that all or most of the mortgage loans that we acquire will be secured only by real property and no other property value is taken into account in our underwriting process in addition in certain cases personal property collateral securing a loan that we hold may be treated as real property for purposes of the foregoing rules         in addition the code provides that a regular or a residual interest in a remic is generally treated as a real estate asset for the purpose of the reit asset tests and any amount includible in our gross income with respect to such an interest is generally treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property for the purpose of the reit gross income tests if however less than  of the assets of a remic in which we hold an interest consist of real estate assets determined as if we held such assets we will be treated as receiving directly our proportionate share of the income of the remic for the purpose of determining the amount of income from the remic that is treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property in connection with the expanded harp program the irs issued guidance providing that among other things if a reit holds a regular interest in an eligible remic or a residual interest in an eligible remic that informs the reit that at least  of the remics assets constitute real estate assets then the reit may treat  of the gross income received with respect to the interest in the remic as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property for the purpose of the  gross income test for this purpose a remic is an eligible remic if i the remic has received a guarantee from the fnma or the fhlmc that will allow the remic to make any principal and interest payments on its regular and residual interests and ii all of the remics mortgages and passthrough certificates are secured by interests in singlefamily dwellings if we were to acquire an interest in an eligible remic less than  of the assets of which constitute real estate assets the irs guidance described above may  table of contents generally allow us to treat  of the gross income derived from the interest as qualifying income for the purposes of  reit gross income test although the portion of the income from such a remic interest that does not qualify would likely be qualifying income for the purpose of the  reit gross income test the remaining  of the remic interest generally would not qualify as a real estate asset which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy the reit asset tests         fee income     fees will generally be qualifying income for purposes of both the  and  gross income tests if they are received in consideration for entering into an agreement to make a loan secured by real property and the fees are not determined by income and profits other fees generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of either gross income test any fees earned by a trs however will not be included for purposes of the gross income tests         hedging transactions     any income or gain that we or our passthrough subsidiaries derive from instruments that hedge certain specified risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of both the  and  gross income tests provided that specified requirements are met including the requirement that the instrument is entered into during the ordinary course of our business and that the instrument be properly identified as a hedge along with the risk that it hedges within prescribed time periods income and gain from all other hedging transactions will not be qualifying income for either the  or  gross income test see derivatives and hedging transactions         failure to satisfy the gross income tests     if we fail to satisfy one or both of the  or  gross income tests for any taxable year we may still qualify as a reit for such year if we are entitled to relief under applicable provisions of the code these relief provisions will generally be available if i our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and ii following our identification of the failure to meet the  or  gross income test for any taxable year we file a schedule with the irs setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the  or  gross income test for such taxable year in accordance with treasury regulations yet to be issued it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances if these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances we will not qualify as a reit even where these relief provisions apply the code imposes a tax based upon the amount by which we fail to satisfy the particular gross income test         timing differences between receipt of cash and recognition of income     due to the nature of the assets in which we will invest we may be required to recognize taxable income from those assets in advance of our receipt of cash flow on or proceeds from disposition of such assets and may be required to report taxable income in early periods that exceeds the economic income ultimately realized on such assets         we may acquire mortgagebacked securities in the secondary market for less than their face amount in addition pursuant to our ownership of certain mortgagebacked securities we may be treated as holding certain debt instruments acquired in the secondary market for less than their face amount the discount at which such securities or debt instruments are acquired may reflect doubts about their ultimate collectability rather than current market interest rates the amount of such discount may nevertheless generally be treated as market discount for us federal income tax purposes accrued market discount is generally recognized as income when and to the extent that any payment of principal on the mortgagebacked security or debt instrument is made if we collect less on the mortgagebacked security or debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions         moreover some of the mortgagebacked securities that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount in general we will be required to accrue original issue discount based on the constant yield to maturity of the securities and to treat it as taxable income in accordance with applicable us federal income tax rules even though smaller or no cash payments are received on such  table of contents securities as in the case of the market discount discussed in the preceding paragraph the constant yield in question will be determined and we will be taxed based on the assumption that all future payments due on the mortgagebacked securities in question will be made with consequences similar to those described in the previous paragraph if all payments on the securities are not made         in addition pursuant to our ownership of certain mortgagebacked securities we may be treated as holding distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower if the amendments to the outstanding debt are significant modifications under the applicable treasury regulations the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debtfordebt exchange with the borrower in that event we may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt even if the value of the debt or the payment expectations have not changed following such a taxable modification we would hold the modified loan with a cost basis equal to its principal amount for us federal tax purposes to the extent that such modifications are made with respect to a debt instrument held by a trs that is treated as a dealer or trader and that makes an election to use marktomarket accounting such trs would be required at the end of each taxable year including the taxable year in which any such modification were made to mark the modified debt instrument to its fair market value as if the debt instrument were sold in that case the trs could recognize a loss at the end of the taxable year in which the modifications were made to the extent that the fair market value of such debt instrument at such time was less than the instruments tax basis         in addition in the event mortgagebacked securities or any debt instruments we are treated as holding pursuant to our investments in mortgagebacked securities are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability similarly we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate mortgagebacked securities at the stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received         finally we may be required under the terms of indebtedness that we incur to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payments on that indebtedness with the effect of recognizing income but not having a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders         due to each of these potential timing differences between income recognition or expense deduction and cash receipts or disbursements there is a significant risk that we may have substantial taxable income in excess of cash available for distribution in that event we may need to borrow funds or take other action to satisfy the reit distribution requirements for the taxable year in which this phantom income is recognized see taxation of ladder capital corpannual distribution requirements asset tests         at the close of each calendar quarter we must also satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least  of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of real estate assets cash cash items us government securities and under some circumstances stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital for this purpose real estate assets include some kinds of mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans as well as interests in real property and certain ancillary personal property stock of other corporations that qualify as reits and debt instruments whether or not secured by real property that are issued by a publicly offered reit  ie  a reit that is required to file annual and periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of  assets that do not qualify for purposes of the  asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below         second the value of any one issuers securities that we own may not exceed  of the value of our total assets  table of contents         third we may not own more than  of any one issuers outstanding securities as measured by either voting power or value the  and  asset tests do not apply to securities of trss and qualified reit subsidiaries and the  asset test does not apply to straight debt having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below solely for purposes of the  asset test the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the code         fourth the aggregate value of all securities of trss that we hold may not exceed  or for our  and subsequent taxable years  of the value of our total assets         fifth no more than  of the total value of our assets may be represented by nonqualified publicly offered reit debt instruments ie real estate assets that would cease to be real estate assets if debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits were not included in the definition of real estate assets         notwithstanding the general rule as noted above that for purposes of the reit income and asset tests we are treated as owning our proportionate share of the underlying assets of a subsidiary partnership if we hold indebtedness issued by a partnership the indebtedness will be subject to and may cause a violation of the asset tests unless the indebtedness is a qualifying mortgage asset or other conditions are met similarly although stock of another reit is a qualifying asset for purposes of the reit asset tests any nonmortgage debt that is issued by a nonpublicly offered reit may not so qualify such debt however will not be treated as securities for purposes of the  asset test as explained below         certain securities will not cause a violation of the  asset test described above such securities include instruments that constitute straight debt which term generally excludes among other things securities having contingency features a security does not qualify as straight debt where a reit or a controlled trs of the reit owns other securities of the same issuer which do not qualify as straight debt unless the value of those other securities constitute in the aggregate  or less of the total value of that issuers outstanding securities in addition to straight debt the code provides that certain other securities will not violate the  asset test such securities include i any loan made to an individual or an estate ii certain rental agreements pursuant to which one or more payments are to be made in subsequent years other than agreements between a reit and certain persons related to the reit under attribution rules iii any obligation to pay rents from real property iv securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of or payments made by a nongovernmental entity v any security including debt securities issued by another reit and vi any debt instrument issued by a partnership if the partnerships income is of a nature that it would satisfy the  gross income test described above under income tests in applying the  asset test a debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into account to the extent if any of the reits proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by that partnership         we invest in agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities that are either mortgage passthrough certificates or cmos we expect that these securities will be treated either as interests in grantor trusts or as interests in remics for us federal income tax purposes in the case of mortgagebacked securities treated as interests in grantor trusts we would be treated as owning an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the mortgage loans held by the grantor trust such mortgage loans will generally qualify as real estate assets to the extent that they are secured by real property we expect that substantially all of our mortgagebacked securities treated as interests in grantor trusts will qualify as real estate assets         in the case of mortgagebacked securities treated as interests in a remic such interests will generally qualify as real estate assets if less than  of the assets of a remic are real estate assets however then only a proportionate part of our interest in the remic and income derived from the  table of contents interest will qualify for purposes of the reit asset tests in connection with the expanded harp program the irs issued guidance providing that among other things if a reit holds a regular interest in an eligible remic or a residual interest in an eligible remic that informs the reit that at least  of the remics assets constitute real estate assets then the reit may treat  of the value of the interest in the remic as a real estate asset for the purpose of the reit asset tests for this purpose a remic is an eligible remic if i the remic has received a guarantee from the fnma or the fhlmc that will allow the remic to make any principal and interest payments on its regular and residual interests and ii all of the remics mortgages and passthrough certificates are secured by interests in singlefamily dwellings if we were to acquire an interest in an eligible remic less than  of the assets of which constitute real estate assets the irs guidance described above may generally allow us to treat  of our interest in such a remic as a qualifying real estate asset for the purpose of the reit asset tests the remaining  of the remic interest generally would not qualify as a real estate asset which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy the reit asset tests         if we hold a residual interest in a remic from which we derive excess inclusion income we will be required to either distribute the excess inclusion income or pay tax on it or a combination of the two even though we may not receive the income in cash to the extent that distributed excess inclusion income is allocable to a particular stockholder the income i would not be allowed to be offset by any net operating losses otherwise available to the stockholder ii would be subject to tax as unrelated business taxable income in the hands of most types of stockholders that are otherwise generally exempt from us federal income tax and iii would result in the application of us federal income tax withholding at the maximum rate  without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty or other exemption to the extent allocable to most types of foreign stockholders moreover any excess inclusion income that we receive that is allocable to specified categories of taxexempt investors which are not subject to unrelated business income tax such as government entities or charitable remainder trusts may be subject to corporatelevel income tax in our hands whether or not it is distributed         we enter into sale and repurchase agreements under which we nominally sell certain of our mortgagebacked securities to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets in exchange for a purchase price that reflects a financing charge economically these agreements are financings which are secured by the securities sold pursuant thereto we believe that we will be treated for reit asset and income test purposes as the owner of the securities that are the subject of any such agreement notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement it is possible however that the irs could assert that we did not own the mortgagebacked securities during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement in which case we could fail to qualify as a reit         no independent appraisals have been obtained to support our conclusions as to the value of our total assets or the value of any particular security or securities moreover values of some assets including instruments issued in securitization transactions may not be susceptible to a precise determination and values are subject to change in the future furthermore the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for us federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances which could affect the application of the reit asset requirements accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our interests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit asset tests         however certain relief provisions are available to allow reits to satisfy the asset requirements or to maintain reit qualification notwithstanding certain violations of the asset and other requirements one such provision allows a reit which fails one or more of the asset requirements to nevertheless maintain its reit qualification if i the reit provides the irs with a description of each asset causing the failure ii the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect iii the reit  table of contents pays a tax equal to the greater of a  per failure and b the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate currently  and iv the reit either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame         in the case of de minimis violations of the  and  asset tests a reit may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such requirements if i the value of the assets causing the violation does not exceed the lesser of  of the reits total assets and  and ii the reit either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure or the relevant tests are otherwise satisfied within that time frame         if we should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter such a failure would not cause us to lose our reit qualification if we i satisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and ii the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset requirements was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of nonqualifying assets but instead arose from changes in the market value of our assets if the condition described in ii were not satisfied we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within  days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose or by making use of relief provisions described below annual distribution requirements         in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i  of our net taxable income computed without regard to our net capital gain and the deduction for dividends paid and ii  of our net income if any after tax from foreclosure property as described below minus b the sum of specified items of noncash income         we generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration         to the extent that we distribute at least  but less than  of our net taxable income as adjusted we will be subject to tax at ordinary corporate tax rates on the retained portion we may elect to retain rather than distribute our net longterm capital gains and pay tax on such gains in this case we could elect for our stockholders to include their proportionate shares of such undistributed longterm capital gains in income and to receive a corresponding credit for their share of the tax that we paid our stockholders would then increase their adjusted basis of their stock by the difference between a the amounts of capital gain dividends that we designated and that they include in their taxable income and b the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income         to the extent that in the future we may have available net operating losses carried forward from prior tax years such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements such losses however will generally not affect the character in the hands of our stockholders of any distributions that are actually made as ordinary dividends or capital gains see taxation of stockholderstaxation of taxable us holdersdistributions  table of contents         if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i  of our reit ordinary income for such year ii  of our reit capital gain net income for such year and iii any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods we will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of a the amounts actually distributed plus b the amounts of income we retained and on which we have paid us federal corporate income tax         as discussed above under income teststiming differences between receipt of cash and recognition of income it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between our actual receipt of cash and our inclusion of items in income for us federal income tax purposes in the event that such timing differences occur in order to meet the distribution requirements it might be necessary for us to arrange for shortterm or possibly longterm borrowings or to pay dividends in the form of taxable inkind distributions of property alternatively we may declare a taxable dividend payable in cash or stock at the election of each stockholder where the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed in such dividend may be subject to limitation in such case for us federal income tax purposes taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits         we may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying deficiency dividends to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year in this case we may be able to avoid losing reit qualification or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends subject to the  excise tax described above we will be required to pay interest based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends prohibited transactions         net income that we derive from a prohibited transaction is subject to a  tax the term prohibited transaction generally includes a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property as discussed below that is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by us or by a borrower that has issued a shared appreciation mortgage or similar debt instrument to us we intend to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own or are treated as owning will be treated as or as having been held as inventory or for sale to customers and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances no assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as inventory or property held for sale to customers or that we can comply with certain safeharbor provisions of the code that would prevent such treatment the  tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a trs or other taxable corporation although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate rates we intend to structure our activities to avoid prohibited transaction characterization foreclosure property         foreclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property i that we acquire as the result of having bid in the property at foreclosure or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law after a default or upon imminent default on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by us and secured by the property ii for which we acquired the related loan or lease at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated and iii with respect to which we made a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property we generally will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate currently  table of contents  on any net income from foreclosure property including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the  tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property because we will invest primarily in mortgagebacked securities we do not anticipate receiving any income from foreclosure property that does not qualify for purposes of the  gross income test derivatives and hedging transactions         we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate exposure on one or more of our assets or liabilities any such hedging transactions could take a variety of forms including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts interest rate cap or floor contracts futures or forward contracts and options except to the extent provided by treasury regulations any income from a hedging transaction including gain from the sale disposition or termination of a position in such a transaction will not constitute gross income for purposes of the  or  gross income test if we properly identify the transaction as specified in applicable treasury regulations and we enter into such transaction i in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of interest rate changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets ii primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the  or  income tests or iii in connection with the extinguishment of indebtedness with respect to which we have entered into a qualified hedging position described in clause i or the disposition of property with respect to which we have entered into a qualified hedging position described in clause ii primarily to manage the risks of such hedging positions to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the  and  gross income tests we intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that will not jeopardize our qualification as a reit we may conduct some or all of our hedging activities including hedging activities relating to currency risk through a trs or other corporate entity the income from which may be subject to us federal income tax rather than by participating in the arrangements directly or through passthrough subsidiaries no assurance can be given however that our hedging activities will not give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of either or both of the reit gross income tests or that our hedging activities will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy the reit qualification requirements taxable mortgage pools and excess inclusion income         an entity or a portion of an entity may be classified as a taxable mortgage pool or a tmp under the code if  substantially all of its assets consist of debt obligations or interests in debt obligations  more than  of those debt obligations are real estate mortgages or interests in real estate mortgages as of specified testing dates  the entity has issued debt obligations liabilities that have two or more maturities and  the payments required to be made by the entity on its debt obligations liabilities bear a relationship to the payments to be received by the entity on the debt obligations that it holds as assets         under treasury regulations if less than  of the assets of an entity or a portion of an entity consist of debt obligations these debt obligations are considered not to comprise substantially all of its assets and therefore the entity would not be treated as a tmp our financing and securitization arrangements may give rise to tmps with the consequences as described below  table of contents         where an entity or a portion of an entity is classified as a tmp it is generally treated as a taxable corporation for us federal income tax purposes in the case of a reit or a portion of a reit or a disregarded subsidiary of a reit that is a tmp however special rules apply the tmp is not treated as a corporation that is subject to us federal corporate income tax and the tmp classification does not adversely affect the qualification of the reit rather the consequences of the tmp classification would in general except as described below be limited to the stockholders of the reit         a portion of the reits income from the tmp arrangement could be treated as excess inclusion income the reits excess inclusion income including any excess inclusion income from a residual interest in a remic must be allocated among its stockholders in proportion to dividends paid the reit is required to notify stockholders of the amount of excess inclusion income allocated to them a stockholders share of excess inclusion income  cannot be offset by any net operating losses otherwise available to the stockholder  is subject to tax as unrelated business taxable income in the hands of most types of stockholders that are otherwise generally exempt from us federal income tax and  results in the application of us federal income tax withholding at the maximum rate  without reduction for any otherwise applicable income tax treaty or other exemption to the extent allocable to most types of foreign stockholders         see taxation of stockholders to the extent that excess inclusion income is allocated to a taxexempt stockholder of a reit that is not subject to unrelated business income tax such as a government entity or charitable remainder trust the reit may be subject to tax on this income at the highest applicable corporate tax rate currently  in that case the reit could reduce distributions to such stockholders by the amount of such tax paid by the reit attributable to such stockholders ownership treasury regulations provide that such a reduction in distributions does not give rise to a preferential dividend that could adversely affect the reits compliance with its distribution requirements see taxation of ladder capital corpannual distribution requirements         the manner in which excess inclusion income is calculated or would be allocated to stockholders including allocations among shares of different classes of stock is not clear under current law as required by irs guidance we intend to make such determinations using a reasonable method taxexempt investors foreign investors and taxpayers with net operating losses should carefully consider the tax consequences described above and are urged to consult their tax advisors         if a subsidiary partnership of ours that we do not whollyown directly or through one or more disregarded entities were a tmp the foregoing rules would not apply rather the partnership that is a tmp would be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and potentially would be subject to us federal corporate income tax or withholding tax in addition this characterization would alter our income and asset test calculations and could adversely affect our compliance with those requirements we intend to monitor the structure of any tmps in which we have an interest to ensure that they will not adversely affect our qualification as a reit assetbacked securities         investments in assetbacked securities or abs generally are not qualifying assets for purposes of the  asset test applicable to reits and generally do not generate qualifying income for purposes of the  income test applicable to reits as a result we may be limited in our ability to invest in such assets  table of contents failure to qualify         if we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for reit qualification other than the income or asset tests we could avoid disqualification if our failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of  for each such failure relief provisions are available for failures of the income tests and asset tests as described above in income tests and asset tests         if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described above do not apply we would be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates we cannot deduct distributions to stockholders in any year in which we are not a reit nor would we be required to make distributions in such a year in this situation to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits distributions to most domestic stockholders that are us individuals trusts or estates will generally be taxable at the preferential income tax rates ie the  maximum regular federal rate for qualified dividends in addition subject to the limitations of the code corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we would also be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief tax aspects of our operating partnerships and any subsidiary partnerships         all of our investments are held through two series of lcfh series reit of lcfh and series trs of lcfh series reit holds an interest in series trs through a trs in addition our operating partnerships may hold certain of their investments indirectly through subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies which we expect will be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for us federal income tax purposes in general entities that are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for us federal income tax purposes are passthrough entities which are not required to pay us federal income tax rather partners or members of such entities are allocated their shares of the items of income gain loss deduction and credit of the partnership or limited liability company and are potentially required to pay tax on this income without regard to whether they receive a distribution from the partnership or limited liability company we will include in our income our share of these partnership and limited liability company items for purposes of the various gross income tests the computation of our reit taxable income and the reit distribution requirements moreover for purposes of the asset tests we will include our pro rata share of assets held by our operating partnerships including their share of their subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies based on our capital interest in each such entity see taxation of ladder capital corp entity classification         our interests in our operating partnerships and the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies involve special tax considerations including the possibility that the irs might challenge the status of these entities as partnerships or disregarded entities as opposed to associations taxable as corporations for us federal income tax purposes if our operating partnerships or a subsidiary partnership or limited liability company were treated as an association they would be taxable as a corporation and would be required to pay an entitylevel tax on their income in addition the irs could challenge the treatment of our series partnerships as separate entities in this situation the character of our assets and items of gross income would change and could prevent us from satisfying the reit asset tests and possibly the reit income tests see taxation of ladder capital corpasset tests and income tests this in turn could prevent us from qualifying as a reit see failure to qualify for a discussion of the effect of our failure to meet these tests in addition a change in the tax status or tax treatment of our operating partnerships a subsidiary partnership or limited liability company might be treated as a taxable event if so we might incur a distribution  table of contents requirement or tax liability without any related cash distributions we believe that our operating partnerships and each of our other partnerships and limited liability companies for which we do not make an election to be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes will be classified as partnerships or disregarded entities for us federal income tax purposes allocations of income gain loss and deduction         a partnership agreement or in the case of a limited liability company treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes the limited liability company agreement will generally determine the allocation of partnership income and loss among partners generally section b of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder require that partnership allocations respect the economic arrangement of the partners if an allocation of partnership income or loss does not comply with the requirements of section b of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners interests in the partnership this reallocation will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item our operating partnerships allocations of taxable income and loss are intended to comply with the requirements of section b of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder new partnership audit rules         the recently enacted bipartisan budget act of  changes the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships such as our operating partnership under the new rules which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december   among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and any partners distributive share thereof is determined and taxes interest or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected at the partnership level although it is uncertain how these new rules will be implemented it is possible that they could result in our operating partnership or other partnerships in which we directly or indirect invest being required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment and we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though we as a reit may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporatelevel taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment the changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the us treasury investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes and their potential impact on their investment in our common stock taxation of stockholders taxation of taxable us holders         as used herein the term us holder means a holder of our class a common stock who for us federal income tax purposes is  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states  a corporation or entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes

        if a partnership including for this purpose any entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds our class a common stock the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership an investor that is a partnership and the partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors about the us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of our class a common stock         distributions     so long as we qualify as a reit the distributions that we make to our us holders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits that we do not designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taken into account by such stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporations with limited exceptions our dividends are not eligible for taxation at the preferential income tax rates ie the  maximum regular us federal rate for qualified dividends received by most domestic us holders that are individuals trusts and estates from taxable c corporations such us holders however are taxed at the preferential rates on dividends designated by and received from reits to the extent that the dividends are attributable to  income retained by the reit in the prior taxable year on which the reit was subject to corporate level income tax less the amount of tax  dividends received by the reit from trss or other taxable c corporations or  income in the prior taxable year from the sales of builtin gain property acquired by the reit from c corporations in carryover basis transactions less the amount of corporate tax on such income         distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends generally will be taxed to our us holders as longterm capital gains to the extent that such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which the us holder that receives such distribution has held its stock we may elect to retain and pay taxes on some or all of our net longterm capital gains in which case provisions of the code will treat our us holders as having received solely for tax purposes our undistributed capital gains and the us holders will receive a corresponding credit for taxes that we paid on such undistributed capital gains see taxation of ladder capital corpannual distribution requirements corporate us holders may be required to treat up to  of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income longterm capital gains are generally taxable at maximum regular us federal rates of  in the case of stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates and  in the case of stockholders that are corporations capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held for more than  months are subject to a  maximum regular us federal income tax rate for taxpayers who are taxed as individuals to the extent of previously claimed depreciation deductions         distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will generally represent a return of capital and will not be taxable to a us holder to the extent that the amount of such distributions does not exceed the adjusted basis of the us holders shares in respect of which the distributions were made rather the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the us holders shares to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted basis of a us holders shares such holder generally must include such distributions in income as longterm capital gain or shortterm capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less in addition any dividend that we declare in october november or december of any year and that is payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on december  of such year provided that we actually pay the dividend before the end of january of the following calendar year  table of contents         to the extent that we have available net operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements see taxation of ladder capital corpannual distribution requirements such losses however are not passed through to stockholders and do not offset income of stockholders from other sources nor would such losses affect the character of any distributions that we make which are generally subject to tax in the hands of stockholders to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits         dispositions of ladder stock     if a us holder sells or disposes of shares of our stock it will generally recognize gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on the sale or other disposition and the stockholders adjusted tax basis in the shares of ladder stock in general capital gains recognized by individuals trusts or estates upon the sale or disposition of our stock will be subject to a maximum regular us federal income tax rate of  if the stock is held for more than one year and will be taxed at ordinary income rates of up to  if the stock is held for one year or less gains recognized by us holders that are corporations are subject to us federal income tax at a maximum rate of  whether or not such gains are classified as longterm capital gains capital losses recognized by a us holder upon the disposition of our stock that was held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses and capital losses are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the us holder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to  of ordinary income each year in addition any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock by a us holder who has held the shares for six months or less after applying holding period rules will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of distributions that we make that are required to be treated by the stockholder as longterm capital gain         if an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our stock or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold it is possible that the provisions of treasury regulations involving reportable transactions could apply with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the lossgenerating transaction to the irs these regulations though directed towards tax shelters are broadly written and apply to transactions that would not typically be considered tax shelters the code imposes significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements you should consult your tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or disposition of our stock or securities or transactions that we might undertake directly or indirectly moreover you should be aware that we and other participants in the transactions in which we are involved including their advisors might be subject to disclosure or other requirements pursuant to these regulations         passive activity losses and investment interest limitations     distributions that we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a us holder will not be treated as passive activity income as a result us holders will not be able to apply any passive losses against income or gain relating to our stock to the extent that distributions we make do not constitute a return of capital they will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation taxation of foreign stockholders         the rules governing us federal income taxation of the ownership and disposition of our class a common stock by persons that are for purposes of such taxation nonresident alien individuals foreign corporations foreign partnerships or foreign estates or trusts collectively nonus holders are complex and no attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules accordingly the discussion does not address all aspects of us federal income tax law and does not address state local or foreign tax consequences that may be relevant to a nonus holder in light of its particular circumstances in addition this discussion is based on current law which is subject to change and assumes that ladder will qualify for taxation as a reit nonus holders should consult  table of contents their tax advisors to determine the impact of us federal state local and foreign tax laws with regard to the ownership and disposition of our class a common stock including reporting requirements in light of their individual circumstances         ordinary dividends     the portion of dividends received by nonus holders that is i payable out of our earnings and profits ii which is not attributable to our capital gains and iii which is not effectively connected with a us trade or business of the nonus holder will be subject to us withholding tax at the rate of  unless reduced or eliminated by treaty         in general nonus holders will not be considered to be engaged in a us trade or business solely as a result of their ownership of our stock in cases where the dividend income from a nonus holders investment in our stock is or is treated as effectively connected with the nonus holders conduct of a us trade or business the nonus holder generally will be subject to us federal income tax at graduated rates in the same manner as domestic stockholders are taxed with respect to such dividends such income must generally be reported on a us income tax return filed by or on behalf of the nonus holder the income may also be subject to the  branch profits tax in the case of a nonus holder that is a corporation         nondividend distributions     unless our stock constitutes a us real property interest a usrpi distributions that we make which are not dividends out of our earnings and profits will not be subject to us income tax if we cannot determine at the time a distribution is made whether or not the distribution will exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits the distribution will be subject to withholding at the rate applicable to dividends the nonus holder may seek a refund from the irs of any amounts withheld if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits if our stock constitutes a usrpi as described below distributions that we make in excess of the sum of a the stockholders proportionate share of our earnings and profits plus b the stockholders basis in its stock will be taxed under the foreign investment in real property tax act of  or firpta at the rate of tax including any applicable capital gains rates that would apply to a domestic stockholder of the same type eg an individual or a corporation as the case may be and the collection of the tax will be enforced by a withholding at a rate of  of the amount by which the distribution exceeds the stockholders share of our earnings and profits         capital gain dividends     under firpta a distribution that we make to a nonus holder to the extent attributable to gains from dispositions of usrpis that we held directly or through passthrough subsidiaries or usrpi capital gains will except as described below be considered effectively connected with a us trade or business of the nonus holder and will be subject to us income tax at the rates applicable to us individuals or corporations without regard to whether we designate the distribution as a capital gain dividend see above under taxation of foreign stockholdersordinary dividends for a discussion of the consequences of income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business in addition we will be required to withhold tax equal to  of the maximum amount that could have been designated as usrpi capital gains dividends distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a  branch profits tax in the hands of a nonus holder that is a corporation a distribution is not attributable to usrpi capital gain if we held an interest in the underlying asset solely as a creditor capital gain dividends received by a nonus holder that are attributable to dispositions of our assets other than usrpis are not subject to us federal income or withholding tax unless i the gain is effectively connected with the nonus holders us trade or business in which case the nonus holder would be subject to the same treatment as us holders with respect to such gain or ii the nonus holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states in which case the nonus holder will incur a  tax on his capital gains we do not expect that a significant portion of our assets will be usrpis  table of contents         a capital gain dividend that would otherwise have been treated as a usrpi capital gain will not be so treated or be subject to firpta and generally will not be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business and instead will generally be treated in the same manner as an ordinary dividend see taxation of foreign stockholdersordinary dividends if i the capital gain dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states and ii the recipient nonus holder does not own more than  of that class of stock at any time during the year ending on the date on which the capital gain dividend is received we anticipate that our class a common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities exchange         dispositions of ladder stock     unless our stock constitutes a usrpi a sale of our stock by a nonus holder generally will not be subject to us taxation under firpta our stock will be treated as a usrpi if  or more of our assets throughout a prescribed testing period consist of interests in real property located within the united states excluding for this purpose interests in real property solely in a capacity as a creditor it is not currently anticipated that our stock will constitute a usrpi however we cannot assure you that our stock will not become a usrpi         even if the foregoing  test is met our stock will not constitute a usrpi if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity a domestically controlled qualified investment entity includes a reit less than  of the value of which is held directly or indirectly by nonus holders at all times during a specified testing period after applying certain presumptions regarding the ownership of our stock as described in the code we believe that we will be and will remain a domestically controlled qualified investment entity and that a sale of our stock should not be subject to taxation under firpta however no assurance can be given that we will be or will remain a domestically controlled qualified investment entity         in the event that we are not a domestically controlled qualified investment entity but our stock is regularly traded as defined by applicable treasury regulations on an established securities market a nonus holders sale of our class a common stock nonetheless also would not be subject to tax under firpta as a sale of a usrpi provided that the selling nonus holder held  or less of our outstanding class a common stock any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the sale we expect that our class a common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities market         if gain on the sale of our stock were subject to taxation under firpta the nonus holder would be required to file a us federal income tax return and would be subject to the same treatment as a domestic stockholder with respect to such gain subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the purchaser of the stock could be required to withhold  of the purchase price and remit such amount to the irs         gain from the sale of our stock that would not otherwise be subject to firpta will nonetheless be taxable in the united states to a nonus holder in two cases i if the nonus holders investment in our stock is effectively connected with a us trade or business conducted by such nonus holder the nonus holder will be subject to the same treatment as a domestic stockholder with respect to such gain or ii if the nonus holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a  tax on the individuals capital gain in addition even if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity upon disposition of our stock subject to the  exception applicable to regularly traded stock described above a nonus holder may be treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a usrpi if the nonus holder i disposes of our class a common stock within a day period preceding the exdividend date of a distribution any portion of which but for the disposition would have been treated as gain  table of contents from the sale or exchange of a usrpi and ii acquires or enters into a contract or option to acquire other shares of our class a common stock within  days after such exdividend date         special firpta rules     recently enacted amendments to fiprta create special rules that modify the application of the foregoing firpta rules for particular types of foreign investors including qualified foreign pension funds and their wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and certain widely held publicly traded qualified collective investment vehicles nonus stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the applicability of these or any other special firpta rules to their particular investment in our common stock         estate tax     if our stock is owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident as specially defined for us federal estate tax purposes of the united states at the time of such individuals death the stock will be includable in the individuals gross estate for us federal estate tax purposes

sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts generally are exempt from us federal income taxation however they may be subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income ubti while some investments in real estate may generate ubti the irs has ruled that dividend distributions from a reit to a taxexempt entity do not constitute ubti based on that ruling and provided that i a taxexempt stockholder has not held our stock as debt financed property within the meaning of the code ie where the acquisition or holding of the property is financed through a borrowing by the taxexempt stockholder and ii our stock is not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business distributions that we make and income from the sale of our stock generally should not give rise to ubti to a taxexempt stockholder         taxexempt stockholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans exempt from us federal income taxation under sections c c c and c of the code are subject to different ubti rules which generally require such stockholders to characterize distributions that we make as ubti         in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than  of our stock could be required to treat a percentage of the dividends as ubti if we are a pensionheld reit we will not be a pensionheld reit unless i we are required to look through one or more of our pension trust stockholders in order to satisfy the reit closelyheld test and ii either a one pension trust owns more than  of the value of our stock or b one or more pension trusts each individually holding more than  of the value of our stock collectively owns more than  of the value of our stock certain
