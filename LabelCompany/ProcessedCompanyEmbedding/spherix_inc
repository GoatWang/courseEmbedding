similar proposed staffing and marketing approach  where the agencys evaluation identified significant weaknesses in the protesters proposal but failed to identify them for the offeror during

agriculture forest service for the national recreation reservation service nrrs spherix challenges the agencys conduct of discussions evaluation of proposals and source selection decision we sustain the protest background federal agencies and private concessionaires or lessees currently operate and maintain recreational facilities and activities for public uses these facilities and activities are located on federal lands national recreation areas wilderness areas water resource development projects historic sites and national monuments rfp c at   previously the national park service operated the national park reservation service nprs to provide reservation and management services for national park service facilities spherix was the incumbent contractor for the nprs id at  agency report ar tab  spherix project agreement response at  the forest service in partnership with the us army corps of engineers and the bureau of land management operated the nrrs providing reservation services for other federal facilities and activities at  field locations reserveamerica was the incumbent contractor for nrrs rfp c at  ar tab  reserveamerica project agreement response at  these systems operated independently contractor officers statement at  as part of an egovernment initiative the government seeks to consolidate its reservation systems for all federal parks and recreation facilities and activities into the nrrs with the goal of providing onestop reservation shopping contracting officers statement at  ar tab  nrrs acquisition plan at  to accomplish this the rfp provides for the award of a contract for the development provision and operation of a stateoftheart reservation system with a webbased portal that would include multiple sales channels telephone call center internet and walkup   providing onestop reservation shopping directly to the public for camping tours tickets permits activities and recreationrelated sales as well as providing general recreation and trip planning information about all federal recreation areas the system would also provide administrative and field personnel of federal land management agencies with the ability to access and manage reservation and recreation information rfp c at  m at  offerors were informed that the contract would be funded primarily by fees such as reservation fees service fees and use fees collected from the public rfp c at  in accordance with federal acquisition regulation far  the forest service established a twostep advisory process for this acquisition the first stepthe project agreementsought capability information such as past performance information from potential offerors to allow the agency to advise those firms about their potential to be viable competitors under the rfp of the ten firms submitting capability information only three firms including spherix and reserveamerica were invited to participate under the second stepthe rfp contracting officers statement at  the rfp as amended provided for the award of a fixedunitprice requirements contract for a base period from the date of award until december   and included six year award terms rfp amend  b at  a detailed performance work statement was provided describing the services and capabilities required rfp c at  offerors were informed that award would be made on the basis of a costtechnical tradeoff and identified the following five evaluation factors in descending order of importance   technical approach  management approach  reservation system demonstration  past performance and  price rfp m at  the first four factors were stated to be significantly more important than price and rfp informed offerors that the government intended to make award based primarily on technical merit although price would become more important as the difference in technical merit narrowed id the rfp provided that price would be evaluated for realism completeness and reasonableness id at  section b of the solicitation services and pricescosts schedule required offerors to propose unit prices for each service  eg  reservations ticketing permits provided to the public by telephone or internet or at field and kiosk locations and provide prices for equipment and telecommunications connections provided to the government rfp amend  b at  as described by the contracting officer the contractor would be paid on a per reservation transaction basis which includes all subsequent transactions related to the original reservation including changes cancellations and no shows contracting officer statement at  the solicitation schedule did not identify estimated volume levels but requested that offerors provide unit pricing at various estimated volume levels of their own choosing  rfp amend  b at  also the schedule provided two alternate pricing scenarios scenario a which was comprised of separate contract line item numbers clin for call center reservations and for internet reservations and scenario b which combined the call center and internet reservations into a single clin see id at  scenario b was considered by the agency to be an incentive for internet sales which the agency viewed as less costly than call center sales contracting officers statement at  the rfp provided that award would be based on only one of these scenarios rfp amend  b at  detailed proposal preparation instructions were provided see rfp l at  the rfp provided for both written proposals and oral presentations in this regard offerors were informed that the written proposals exclusive of plans were limited to  pages id at  proposals were received from four firms including spherix and reserveamerica following evaluation of the written proposals by the agencys source selection evaluation team sset one firms proposal was rejected contracting officers statement at  the remaining three offerors including spherix and reserveamerica made oral presentations which included reservation system demonstrations id at  following the oral presentations discussions were conducted and final proposal revisions received id at  spherixs and reserve americas final proposals were evaluated as follows  factor spherix reserveamerica technical approach deleted deleted management approach deleted deleted system demonstration deleted deleted past performance deleted deleted overall goodmoderate risk excellentlow risk scenario a price scenario b price deleted deleted  deleted agency report tab  source selection decision at    the offerors evaluated prices were calculated by averaging the volume estimates from all three proposals and applying this average to each offerors proposed unit prices  the ssets evaluation results were presented to the agencys source selection authority ssa  hearing transcript tr at  see ar supplemental documents source selection briefing slides at   the sset identified numerous strengths for reserveamerica including the provision of a deleted  dedicated staff comprehensive quality control plan and comprehensive and innovative marketing to grow the service and no weaknesses id at  the sset identified less strengths for spherix and a number of significant weaknesses including quality control plan was not comprehensive in approach no marketing no growth and transition period staffing id at  the sset recommended award to reserveamerica despite spherixs substantially lower price id at  prior to the ssets evaluation briefing the ssa received a draft source selection decision from the sset and the ssa was aware of spherixs large price advantage see tr at   the ssa asked a number of questions to explore why the sset believed that reserveamericas proposal represented the best value and asked the sset to quantify the value of a number of reserveamericas evaluated advantages see tr at   for example the ssa noted so the question that i was looking at was how to determine best value one of the comments made was that the two companies looked differently at the marketing strategies one of them saw a tremendous amount of growth and had an aggressive marketing strategy one predicted very little growth and did not have a very aggressive marketing strategy tr at  and the sset made a big deal about reserveamericas marketing plan having adeleted million value whats important to me is does it have a deleted million effect maybe it has more that kind of thing tr at  the ssa accepted the ssets evaluated strengths and weaknesses in the two firms proposals and did not independently read or evaluate proposals trat  the ssa concluded that reserveamericas proposal reflected the best value to the government finding that reserveamericas proposal was technically superior to spherixs under both the technical approach and management approach factors under the technical approach factor the ssa cited among a number of identified proposal strengths reserveamericas offer of a technically advanced webbased reservation system    which provides the centralized system to deliver the multipurpose services of the nrrs deleted dedicated staff members for the nrrs that include deleted agency specific program managers and marketing under the management approach factor the ssa cited among other things reserveamericas exceptional and comprehensive quality control plan reserveamerica was also found superior under the reservation system demonstration factor however the two firms were found by the ssa to be essentially equivalent under the past performance factor ar tab  source selection decision at  to assess the value of reserveamericas technical superiority against spherixs nearlydeleted million or deleted percent price advantage the ssa noted that there are several elements of the reserveamerica proposal that go beyond the spherix approach that can be quantified into dollars that bridge this gap and there are also a number of nonquantifiable elements as well as follows  value of dedicated sales staff deletedper year reserveamerica is proposing dedicating deleted call center staff to this effort if using an annual salary of the median call center salary is  in arlington virginia then this comes out to the annual cost noted spherix is certainly allotting personnel time for the call center as well however it is not the fully dedicated support reserveamerica is proposing it is difficult to understand how many personnel will be working on the nrrs for spherix the value projected is deleted of that offered by reserveamerica  reserveamerica marketing plan one area of their solution that clearly separates reserveamerica from spherix is their marketing plans based upon experience under the current nrrs marketing program that is valued at overdeleted million in annual marketing value reserveamericas proposed marketing plan will provide greater innovative features focused on the customer their commitment to expand the nrrs is reflected in increased costs and can be seen in the reserveamericaspherix estimated growth comparison see attachment    other value considerations there are many other aspects of reserveamericas proposal that provide significant value to the government and the customer and are difficult to quantify these include a deleted b deleted c quality control approach    d an innovative implementation plan    agency report tab  source selection decision at  the ssa concluded that because the intent of the nrrs is to provide high quality recreation reservation services to the public features such as the quality control plan deleted and deletedrepresent significant value to the government the smooth and effective operation of the nrrs is essential for the government and its recreation cooperators and contractors to make recreation opportunities accessible to the public for these reasons the solicitation informed offerors that the technical approach was the most significant nonprice factor management approach the second most significant nonprice factor and the system demonstration the third most significant nonprice factor the solicitation also informed offerors that the nonprice factors were significantly more important than the price thus given the significantly better technical approach the significantly better management approach and the significantly better system demonstration and in light of the essentially equivalent past performance i conclude that even at the significantly higher price the reserveamerica scenario a offer provides the best value to the government id at  award was made to reserveamerica and following a debriefing spherix filed this protest  discussion spherix challenges the agencys evaluation of both firms proposals and the source selection decision based upon that evaluation specifically spherix argues that the agencys evaluation of reserveamericas offer of dedicated staff and marketing plan as substantial technical advantages over spherixs proposal is unreasonable where the solicitation did not require the submission of or provide for the evaluation of proposed dedicated staff or a marketing plan moreover spherix argues that it in fact also offered dedicated staff and provided information regarding its marketing approach which were not fairly considered by the ssa in his selection decision in reviewing a protest of an agencys evaluation and source selection decision we will not reevaluate proposals but will review the record to determine whether the evaluation and selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and with applicable procurement laws and regulations ms farms inc  b sept    cpd  at  dedicated staff as noted above the agencys evaluation documentation and source selection decision specifically identified under the technical approach factor reserveamericas offer of deleted dedicated staff positions as a proposal strength which was one of the ssas bases for offsetting spherixs price advantage in this regard the rfps work statement provided that the contractor would be required to operate a contact center to receive phone calls for or related to reservations and recreationrelated sales and shall provide all aspects of this service including but not limited to    trained staff and experienced supervision rfp c at  however the rfp did not state specific staffing requirements instruct offerors to provide their staffing levels in their proposals or specifically inform offerors that such staffing would be evaluated  we find the agencys assessment of reserveamericas offer of dedicated staff problematic in a number of regards first the ssa apparently believed that spherix did not propose the dedicated support that reserveamerica proposed in this regard in the hearing conducted by our office in this matter the ssa testified that he understood from the ssets briefing that spherixs proposal had not committed to provide the level of effort needed to provide the call center services  tr at both spherix and reserveamerica addressed staffing in their proposals reserveamericas proposal identified deleted dedicated to serving the needs of the nrrs that would include deleted agencyspecific program managers and deleted contact center agents ar tab  reserveamerica final proposal revision at     as noted above this offer was assessed as a proposal strength for reserveamerica spherixs proposal stated that spherix would deliver deleted call center seats and a dedicated staff of reservation specialists and customer service representatives with experienced management and specifically proposed key personnel that included deleted dedicated to each major stakeholder agency ar tab  spherix final proposal revision at   this aspect of spherixs proposal was not discussed in the sset final consensus evaluation see ar supplemental documents final consensus evaluation worksheets for spherix   from our review of the record we find no reasonable support for the agencys conclusion that reserveamericas promise of dedicated staff represented a significant proposal advantage over spherixs similar offer as noted above both firms indicated in their proposals that dedicated staff would be provided although it is true that spherixs proposal did not specifically identify the number of dedicated staff as reserveamericas proposal did this specific information was neither requested by the rfp nor sought by the agency during discussions moreover the record does not show that the ssa otherwise fairly considered spherixs offer of dedicated staff the ssa stated that he had not reviewed spherixs proposal and the ssets briefing left him with the understanding that spherixs proposal had not committed to provide the level of effort needed to provide the call center services tr at  this was neither a reasonable evaluation of spherixs proposal nor a reasonable assessment of the difference between reserveamericas and spherixs proposals moreover while we recognize that an agency is not required to dollarize the value of assessed proposed strengths here the agency did that  and we find unreasonable the ssas conclusion that quantified the value of reserveamericas offer of deleted dedicated call center staff to bedeleted per year the agency calculated this amount by multiplying an estimated average annual salary by the number of staff that reserveamerica offered  and thus this value reflects only reserveamericas estimated costs of providing these deleted dedicated staff the agency recognized that spherix would be providing some amount of staff to perform this work but because the agency did not know the amount of dedicated staff that spherix would provide and did not ask the agency merely projected spherixs staffing to be deleted percent of reserveamericas staffing see ar tab  source selection decision at  although the basis for this projection is somewhat uncertain the recollection of one sset member is that the percentage is based on comparing the size of spherixs call center staff under its current nprs contract with the deleted dedicated staff stated in reserveamericas proposal tr at  that comparison is unreasonable however because under the rfp the nprs is being consolidated with all of the other recreation reservation services including the larger existing nrrs given the substantial increase in reservation services under the rfp the call center staff size under the nprs could not reasonably be assumed to be similar in staff size for the consolidated system in any event the agency did not determine a value associated with its projection of the staff that it believed spherix would provide in short the record does not establish reasonable support for the determination that reserveamericas dedicated staff reflected additional value marketing approach as explained above the ssa assessed a significant proposal strength under the technical approach factor for reserveamericas proposed marketing approach finding that the awardees marketing approach was more aggressive and offered the prospect of greater growth than spherixs marketing approach the ssa quantified the value of reserveamericas marketing approach to be in excess ofdeleted million per year see ar tab  source selection decision at  the rfps work statement provided that the contractor shall develop a marketing plan to implement a nationwide public information and awareness program to promote reservation and recreation related services    within the nrrs     rfp c at  the rfp did not however identify that the offerors approach to marketing plans would be evaluated under any of the evaluation factors nor did the rfp instruct offerors to propose or provide any information about a marketing plan in this regard the agency in answering offerors solicitation questions stated that the marketing plan is a contract deliverable see ar tab  answers to industry questions no  at  and that a detailed marketing plan is not a requirement of the proposal id at  in fact though both offerors addressed their approach to performing the marketing plan contract requirement in this regard reserveamerica stated deleted ar tab  reserveamerica final proposal revision at  spherix stated that deleted ar tab  spherix final proposal revision at  the ssas conclusion that reserveamericas approach to the marketing plan was a significant proposal advantage is apparently based upon the ssets statements to the ssa that reserveamerica had comprehensive and innovative marketing to grow the service but that spherix proposed no marketing no growth see ar supplemental documents source selection briefing slides at    this conclusion does not appear to be supported in the evaluation record specifically the ssets final consensus evaluation of reserveamericas proposal contains no discussion of that firms approach to the marketing plan see ar tab  final consensus evaluation worksheets for reserveamerica at  with respect to spherixs proposal the sset noted that the firms marketing plan was not comprehensive lacking specifics and detail  rather than spherix had not offered an approach to the marketing plan as stated in the briefing slides provided to the ssa ar supplemental documents final consensus evaluation worksheets for spherix at  spherixs approach to the marketing plan was not identified as needing discussions or clarifications by the sset and was not discussed with the protester see ar tab  negotiations at  the ssa did not independently review proposals rather he relied upon the sset for its evaluation conclusions the sset however led the ssa to believe that although spherix proposed some level of marketing its proposed approach was inadequate tr at   in fact as noted above the ssets briefing slides to the ssa erroneously stated that spherix offered no marketing no growth in this regard the ssa apparently believed that reserveamerica proposed higher costs for its marketing plan and that reserveamericas larger estimated growth in volume over the term of the contract reflected that firms commitment to its marketing plan see ar tab  source selection decision at  there is no support for these conclusions first the rfp did not request and the offerors did not provide costing information that would have allowed the ssa to determine that reserveamericas costs reflected any commitment to its marketing plan in this regard the ssa testified that he did not know how it was determined that reserveamerica was dedicating more costs to marketing than spherix see tr at  as to projected growth while it is true that spherix did not offer a growth projection in its transaction volumes for the award term years as reserveamerica did the rfp did not state that offerors should provide growth in their projected transaction estimates indeed spherixs final proposal revision advised the agency that the firm could provide growth estimates if desired  the ssa was unaware however of the context of spherixs decision not to provide projected growth estimates see trat  we also question how the ssa determined that reserveamericas assertedly superior marketing approach would be worthdeleted million per year apparently this amount was calculated from reserveamericas current marketing plan for the incumbent nrrs contract which was not provided as part of reserveamericas proposal see trat nevertheless no explanation has been provided by the agency or the ssa as to exactly how this amount was calculated  nor does the record evidence any consideration of the value of spherixs marketing approach in sum there is simply nothing in the evaluation record provided by the agency that supports the ssas conclusion that reserveamericas marketing approach is superior to that of spherix in this regard from our review of the firms proposals their approach to the marketing plan requirement appears similar and there is no documentation in the record showing the agency had actually compared the firms approaches to meeting this requirement we also note that to the extent that the agency believed spherixs approach to the marketing plan requirement was inadequate the ssets briefing slides identified this to be a significant weakness this should have been but was not raised with spherix during discussions  given spherixs substantial price advantage any narrowing of the difference in perceived difference in technical quality between spherixs and reserveamericas proposal could result in a different selection decision in this respect the ssa admitted that he may have made a different selection decision if reserveamerica did not provide sufficient value to bridge the gap between the cost differences  see tr at  as a result we conclude that the flaws in the evaluation of proposals prejudiced spherix and we therefore sustain this basis of spherixs protest meaningful discussions we also find that the forest service did not conduct meaningful discussions with spherix it is a fundamental precept of negotiated procurements that discussions when conducted must be meaningful that is discussions may not mislead offerors and must identify deficiencies and significant weaknesses in each offerors proposal that could reasonably be addressed in a manner to materially enhance the offerors potential for receiving award far d lockheed martin corp  b etal  may    cpd  at  as described above the sset identified spherixs marketing approach including a lack of projected growth to be a significant weakness see ar supplemental documents source selection briefing slides at  spherixs approach to the marketing plan requirement was not discussed with the protester and therefore we conclude that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions with the firm in this respect we also find that the agency did not conduct meaningful discussions with spherix with respect to its proposed quality control plan which was also determined to be a significant weakness the rfp provided for the evaluation of offerors draft comprehensive quality control plan to include a performance work summary prs with standards acceptable quality level aql and incentives rfp m at  spherixs initial proposal described its proposed quality control plan see ar tab spherix initial proposal at  which the sset evaluated to be a weakness stating that spherixs overall quality control plan    is not a complete approach    vendor must amplify a more thorough approach to quality control ensuring that deleted are addressed see ar supplemental documents final sset evaluation worksheets for spherix at  the sset also evaluated spherixs proposed approach to the prs and aql requirements to be weaknesses id in its discussions with spherix the agency addressed only the firms proposed approach to the prs and aql requirements and spherixs proposal revisions sufficiently addressed those aspects of its proposal such that the agency no longer identified them as proposal weaknesses id the agency did not otherwise address spherixs quality control plan during discussions id in its final evaluation the sset noted that spherix had not changed its proposal with respect to its proposed quality control plan and stated that discussions were not conducted on this weakness because spherix had a plan the plan was simply weak id ultimately this aspect of spherixs proposal was identified by the sset identified to be a significant weakness see ar supplemental documents source selection briefing slides at we therefore find that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions with spherix with respect to its proposed quality control plan we also find that spherix did not receive meaningful discussions with respect to its proposed transition period staffing which was evaluated as a part of the proposed project implementation plan under the management approach factor see rfp m at  spherixs response to this requirement was evaluated as a weakness because the sset found that spherix did not provide detailed information sset did not conduct discussions on the matter with spherix because it concluded that spherixs proposal spoke to staffing but weak in identification see ar supplemental documents final sset consensus evaluation worksheets for spherix at  this aspect of spherixs proposal which was identified by the sset as a significant weakness see ar supplemental documents source selection briefing slides at also should have been raised with spherix during discussions but was not other issues the protester challenged a number of other aspects of the agencys evaluation which we need not address given our decision sustaining spherixs protest specifically spherix challenged the agencys price evaluation because of the agencys averaged quantity estimates although we do not address this issue we note that a substantial portion of this protest basis arises from though not based upon the fact that the rfp did not state quantity estimates in the price schedule the agency may wish to consider identifying total estimated quantities for calculating total prices thereby allowing offerors to prepare their price proposals on the same basis  spherix also challenged the agencys evaluation of the firms past performance we note that although the ssa was informed that the offerors were equivalent under the past performance factor he was not informed of one of the few evaluated weaknesses in reserveamericas final proposal ie  deleted nor was he aware of the substance of the offerors past performance histories see tr at  because we have recommended that the competition be reopened and a new selection decision prepared the agency will have the opportunity to inform the ssa of the evaluated differences in the firms past performance and potentially related weaknesses and risks such as the one identified here spherix also complains that the forest service accepted reserveamericas deleted implementation plan which deleted ar tab  reserveamerica final proposal revision at  the protester argues the forest service improperly relaxed the solicitation requirements which provided for deleted the agency disputes this and argues that this protest ground is untimely although we do not decide the matter we note that neither the sset nor the ssa considered the impact of deleted on the other evaluated strengths of reserveamericas proposal and further note that the approach appears inconsistent with the stated goal of the acquisition to consolidate all the many systems into a single system recommendation because we find unreasonable the agencys evaluation of proposals conduct of discussions and source selection decision we sustain the protest we recommend that the agency amend the solicitation if appropriate reopen discussions request revised proposals and make a new source selection decision if an offeror other than reserveamerica is selected for award the agency should terminate reserveamericas contract and make award to that other firm  we also recommend that the agency reimburse the protester its cost of pursuing this protest including reasonable attorneys fees  cfr d  the protester should submit its certified claim for costs detailing the time expended and the costs incurred directly to the contracting agency within  days of receipt of this decision  cfr f the protest is sustained anthony h gamboa general counsel  pages in documents contained in the agencys report are sequentially bates numbered when citing to these documents we use the sequential numbers  a walkup reservation sale occurs in the field when a customer arrives at a recreation facility or activity without a prior reservation rfp c at   for each technical evaluation factor the rfp identified numerous subordinate evaluation criteria which were stated to be of equal importance to each other  the contracting officer states that offerors were requested to identify their own estimated volume levels to allow the government to rely on the offerors expertise in estimating the anticipated volume to see how a particular offeror projected their ability to grow transaction volumes and to allow the offeror to determine its own ceiling for transaction volume discounts contracting officers statement at   the third offerors proposal received lower technical ratings and proposed higher prices than either spherixs or reserveamericas proposals and was eliminated from consideration for award ar tab  source selection decision at   the agency intended to establish evaluated prices based on a government estimate of sales volume which was not disclosed to the offerors and which the government expected would reflect a reasonable rate of growth over the full term of the contract including option years however upon receiving the offerors estimates the agency determined that the government estimate overstated the growth rate in the outyears of the contract term the agency determined that the offerors estimates were more consistent with each other than with the government estimate and the agency discarded its estimate in favor of an average of the offerors estimates contracting officers statement at   the record is unclear as to exactly which evaluation documents were reviewed by the ssa apparently the ssa reviewed a proposal evaluation and analysis report a number of drafts of which are contained in the record see agencys supplemental document production nov   at  and which eventually formed the basis of the source selection decision see tr at    the agency did not produce these slides until just several days prior to the hearing conducted by our office in this protest  deleted see ar tab  reserveamerica final proposal revision at   this attachment is a table estimating and comparing the growth rates in the firms proposed volume estimates reserveramerica  percent and spherix  percent ar tab  source selection decision at   the protest was filed within  days of a required debriefing and as required by the competition in contracting act of  cica  usc d   the agency suspended contract performance subsequently the agency prepared a written determination that performance of the contract during the protest was in the best interests of the united states  usc dc  the rfp did identify staffing for the transition period as an evaluation subcriterion under the management approach factor rfp m at  however the dedicated staffing identified as an evaluated advantage for reserveamericas proposal under the technical approach factor was not part of the transition plan  the ssa testified that he did not see significant value in dedicated call center agents per se  but that his concern was whether an offeror had committed sufficient labor hours to the contract for that purpose tr at   there is no requirement that a selection official in performing a costtechnical tradeoff quantify or dollarize by calculating a precise value the technical advantages offered see kra corp  b b apr    cpd  at   the offerors did not provide salary information in their proposals and therefore the salary estimate is not based upon reserveamericas projected salaries for this staff  neither firm provided a marketing plan which as described above is a contract deliverable item  in its proposal spherix stated that since the rfp provided no instructions or information related to growth deleted ar tab  spherix final proposal revision at   the agency argues that how the ssa quantified the value of reserveamericas marketing approach and dedicated staff is not material because he otherwise determined that reserveamericas proposal reflected the best value to the government although the agency now desires to disavow this part of the ssas selection decision the written decision documents the ssas contemporaneous costtechnical tradeoff judgment which included the dollarized values for reserveamericas assertedly superior market approach and dedicated staff in this respect the ssa testified that the written source selection decision accurately reflected his thinking at the time of the selection decision tr at  in any event the awardees marketing approach and dedicated staff were identified as significant discriminators in the selection decision apart from their quantified dollar value see agency report tab  source selection decision    although the ssas decision suggests that spherixs approach to the marketing plan requirement was inadequate the agency now acknowledges that spherixs proposed marketing approach meets the agencys requirements agencys hearing comments at   in its report the agency argues that although some elements of the award decision may be flawed the award decision as a whole was reasonable and should stand agencys posthearing comments at  here however the ssa concluded that spherixs substantial price advantage was outweighed by the perceived technical advantages in reserveamericas proposal some of which we have found unsupported in the record although other aspects of reserveamericas proposal appear to have been reasonably found superior to spherixs reduction of any aspect of reserveamericas perceived technical superiority could potentially lead the ssa to make a different tradeoff decision  the rfp could still request that offerors propose the quantity levels at which their lower unit prices for higher volume levels would take effect  consistent with the requirement of cica regarding the impact of an agencys decision to override the automatic stay of performance on best interests grounds as occurred here our recommendation is made
