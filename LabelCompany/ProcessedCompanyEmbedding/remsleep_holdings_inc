june   following its acquisition of handcamp on june   a gold property located in the province of newfoundland and labrador canada handcamp the company changed its business model to that of a mineral acquisition exploration and development company focused primarily on gold properties on august   the companys name was changed from bella viaggio inc to kat gold holdings corp on january   the name of the company was changed to remsleep holdings inc and the business model was changed to reflect the new direction of the company to develop and distribute products to help people affected by sleep apnea remsleep holdings inc has a patent pending new innovative sleep apnea product that will meet multiple market needs and be able to reach a large percentage of patients worldwide remsleep was founded by two principals with over  years of sleepindustry experience including working at some of the pioneering companies they have substantial direct knowledge of all current continuous positive airway pressure cpap equipment on the market and what it is lacking this expertise led to the invention of the deltawave cpap interface the goal of remsleep is to achieve optimum compliance and comfort for cpap patients years of research and development have led to the revolutionary deltawave cpap interface a design that addresses the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patients ability to comply with treatment the deltawave interface does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics is not claustrophobic causes zero work of breathing wob minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses uses less driving pressure and allows users to feel safe and secure while sleeping remsleep is confident that deltawaves unique design will provide patients with a more compliant cpap interface that provides improved comfort ease of use and encourages deep restful sleep the market for sleep treatment and equipment was  billion in  and will reach a projected  billion by  with north america accounting for a majority of the market more than  million cpap interfaces are sold annually in the us with another  million globally there are also an estimated  million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea the deltawave will be launched into the us market first while ce marking is obtained remsleep has already begun discussions with potential industry distributor partners in the us and has received strong interest from a potential distribution partner in germany that has sales channelsdistribution partners throughout the eu they have no current product like the remsleep deltawave and are awaiting samples for evaluation remsleep has also been in contact with two internet retailers one sells directly to patients online the largest internet reseller of sleep products and the other is working with trucking firms selling direct to drivers remsleeps founders have extensive experience in the sleep industry and have direct experience in starting companies and introducing unique products cob russell bird for example found great success with startups medical gases australia and medical industries america both started out of garages before being multimilliondollar ventures tom wood helped found innomed technologies and has productdevelopment experience developing highly successful products in the industry the two founders have worked in collaboration for more than  years and are now focused on bringing to market the bestinclass deltawave cpap interface with the goal of becoming a leading product manufacturer and distributor in this fastgrowing global market the owners have invested  in rd for the deltawave and are seeking an investment of  million for the full launch research and development we are currently engaged in the research and development of new products with the intent of launching them in the future there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop new products or bring any new products to market our website is httpwwwremsleeptechcom cash requirements we operate with virtually no capital we have no long term debt and have been able to meet our past financial obligations including operational expenses exploration expenses and acquisition costs on a current basis going concern as of june   there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business we have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception in addition we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business as a result of these and other factors our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our future success and viability therefore are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing the failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon us and our shareholders managements plans with regard to these matters encompass the following actions liquidity and capital resources we had a cash balance of  as of the date of june   cash flow from operations the net cash provided by operating activities was  for the six months ended june   and  for the six months ended june   cash flows from investing the net cash provided by investing activities was  for the six months ended june   and  for the six months ended june   cash flows from financing the net cash provided by financing activities was  for the six months ended june   and  for the six months ended june   off balance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors critical accounting policies we prepare financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements business activities we have not yet earned any revenue from operations accordingly our activities have been accounted for as those of a development stage enterprise as set forth in financial accounting standards board statement no  accounting and reporting for development stage enterprises sfas no  among the disclosures required by sfas no  are that our financial statements be identified as those of a development stage operation and that the statements of operations shareholders equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of our inception basis of presentation our financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with gaap whereby revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses when incurred we follow sfas no  in preparing our financial statements managements use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates comprehensive income loss we adopted financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no  reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements there were no items of comprehensive income loss applicable to us during the period covered in the financial statements longlived assets in accordance with sfas no  we review and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable when such factors and circumstances exist including those noted above we compare the assets carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives if the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows the fair values of those assets are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values are recorded as impairments in that fiscal period statement of cash flows for purposes of the statement of cash flows we consider all highly liquid investments ie investments which when purchased have original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents the fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the recorded amounts because of the liquidity and shortterm nature of these items recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and do not believe that any future adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations results of operations the three months ended june   compared to the three months ended june   for the three months ended june   compared to the three months ended june   total revenues were  and  respectively and net losses were  and  respectively the net losses

forwardlooking statements after the date of this quarterly report to conform forwardlooking statements to actual results important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning uncertainties including but not limited to uncertainties associated with the following · inadequate capital and barriers to raising the additional capital or to obtaining the financing needed to implement our business plans · our failure to earn revenues or profits · inadequate capital to continue business · volatility or decline of our stock price · potential fluctuation in quarterly results · rapid and significant changes in markets · litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties and · insufficient revenues to cover operating costs the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this quarterly report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in any forwardlooking statements included in this discussion as a result of various factors overview we were incorporated in the state of nevada on june   on august   we changed our name from bella viaggio inc to kat gold holdings corp  effective january   we entered into an exchange agreement to purchase  of the outstanding interests of remsleep llc in exchange for  common shares of remsleep holdings incs stock the exchange agreement as a result of the exchange remsleep llc became our whollyowned subsidiary and constitutes our business and operations and we changed our name to remsleep holdings inc to reflect our new business model of developing and distributing sleep apnea products  our officers have  years of sleepindustry experience including working at sleep industry companies our officers invented our deltawave cpap continuous positive airway pressure interface the deltawave we have developed the deltawave as an innovative new device to treat patients with sleep apnea the patentpending deltawave product is a nasalpillows type interface designed to result in better comfort and therefore better compliance the delta wave is specifically designed with unique airflow characteristics to enable patients with sleep apnea to breathe normally a survey that appeared in dme business found that  of patients stated that maskinterface comfort was their primary concern the primary issue that we have addressed with the deltawave is the work of breathing component we believe that our deltawave is designed to effectively address the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patients ability to comply with treatment as follows · does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics · is not claustrophobic · causes zero work of breathing wob · minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses · uses less driving pressure and · allows users to feel safe and secure while sleeping we plan to conduct clinical trials to test product effectiveness our goal is to develop sleep products that achieve optimum compliance and comfort for cpap patients on june   we applied for a patent for a new innovative sleep apnea product that serves as an interface for the delivery of cpap therapy and other respiratory needs our website is located at httpwwwremsleeptechcom going concern as of march   there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business we have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception in addition we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business as a result of these and other factors our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our future success and viability therefore are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing the failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon us and our shareholders managements plans with regard to these matters encompass the following actions i obtaining funding from new investors to alleviate our working capital deficiency and ii implementing a plan to generate sales our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to resolve our liquidity problems and increase profitability in our current business operations however the outcome of managements plans cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these risks and uncertainties liquidity and capital resources we had no cash as of the date of march   cash flow from operations the net cash flow used in operating activities for the three months ended march   were  as compared to  for the same period ended   cash

sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors critical accounting policies we prepare financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application we believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements business activities  we have not yet earned any revenue from operations accordingly our activities have been accounted for as those of a development stage enterprise as set forth in financial accounting standards board statement no  accounting and reporting for development stage enterprises sfas no  among the disclosures required by sfas no  are that our financial statements be identified as those of a development stage operation and that the statements of operations shareholders equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of our inception  basis of presentation our financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with gaap whereby revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses when incurred we follow sfas no  in preparing our financial statements managements use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates comprehensive income loss we adopted financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no  reporting comprehensive income which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements there were no items of comprehensive income loss applicable to us during the period covered in the financial statements longlived assets in accordance with sfas no  we review and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable when such factors and circumstances exist including those noted above we compare the assets carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives if the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows the fair values of those assets are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values are recorded as impairments in that fiscal period statement of cash flows for purposes of the statement of cash flows we consider all highly liquid investments ie investments which when purchased have original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents the fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the recorded amounts because of the liquidity and shortterm nature of these items recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and do not believe that any future adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable  item  controls and procedures disclosure controls and

and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of march   our management intends during the  fiscal year to design and implement processes and procedures that will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles changes in internal control over financial reporting our management has evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter based on that evaluation management concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the relevant period that has

a projected  billion by  with north america accounting for a majority of the market more than  million cpap interfaces are sold annually in the us with another  million globally there are also an estimated  million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea sleep apnea is a condition that affects millions of people in the united states alone an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and bad working habits has led to obesity and otherwise poor cardiac and aerobic health this has led to a fastgrowing epidemic of obstructive sleep apnea osa which greatly reduces the quality of sleep one gets and can ultimately result in hypertension heart failure stroke and at the least reduced performance in everyday life the market for sleep treatment and equipment was  billion in  and will reach a projected  billion by  with north america accounting for a majority of the market more than  million cpap interfaces are sold annually in the us with another  million globally there are also an estimated  million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea sleep apnea results in numerous afflictions that affect peoples daytoday lives and can eventually contribute to serious health conditions while peoples knowledge of this affliction has grown strongly in recent years and the market is expanding fast nationwide up to  of people with sleep apnea may be undiagnosed   a market of millions of new potential users even those who are tested and prescribed a sleep apnea machine often give up after a short time due to discomfort or what is called the work of breathing with traditional machines in fact over  of patients give up on using cpap therapy after  months this is a major waste of resources and a very telling statistic a major challenge in the current market is not only to get more patients diagnosed but to also increase cpap compliance according to market analyst frost  sullivan the development of finer and ergonomic cpap devices will help increase patient ability to adhere to sleep therapy the market is also seeing a rise in newer technologies that replace elaborate practices target patient comfort to improve compliance and help drive acceptance of sleep monitoring devices a growing knowledge of sleep apnea and its treatment has helped to increase awareness with the public in addition to making the use of a cpap or related device less intimidating a move toward affordable and prescriptionbased technology can greatly expand the market evolving technologies will also influence patient preferences for products treatment modalities and diagnostic locations states frost  sullivan as such the global sleep apnea treatment market is expected to shift to homebased diagnostics for early identification and treatment of patients as well as portable devices that can reduce sleep apnea with minimal inconvenience sleep apnea causes breathing interruptions of between  to  seconds that can occur hundreds of times during a night disrupting the natural sleep rhythm and depriving people of the restorative sleep they need to be energetic mentally sharp and productive the next day cpap can be a very effective method used to treat sleep apnea but as noted noncompliance remains a stubborn issue for both physicians and patients cpap technology therefore is constantly being updated and improved and the new cpap devices are lighter quieter and more comfortable health care spending continues to grow rapidly on an annual basis in the united states spending was  trillion in  and in  it reached over  trillion it is projected to reach over  trillion

reach  billion in   within this market sleep apnea products have experienced rapid growth in the past couple decades there has been a rapid increase in the technological developments in the field of sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment the result has been strong growth for sleep apnea devices globally demand for new and innovative treatment methodologies is driving growth helping to provide patients with a healthy lifestyle obstructive sleep apnea is destroying the health of millions of americans and the problem has only gotten worse over the last two decades according to american academy of sleep medicine president dr timothy morgenthaler the effective treatment of sleep apnea is one of the keys to success as our nation attempts to reduce health care spending and improve chronic disease management sleep problems are considered a global epidemic with sleep apnea as a major contributor to the disorder an estimated  million people worldwide have sleep apnea though

full range of sleep products our competitors have greater financial operational and personnel resources than we do we will attempt to overcome our competitors competitive advantages by emphasizing the advantages of our delta wave product government regulations   fda   our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter supply contracts and criminal prosecution   unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness   our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that was on the market before  or to a device that has been found by the fda to be substantially equivalent to such a pre device a predecessor device is referred to as predicate device as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information   medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether a modification could significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties the fda is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination it is unclear whether the fdas approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new k is required for changes or modifications to existing devices    any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fdas regulatory requirements   we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur   labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as offlabel promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution   other healthcare laws   even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us   the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act   the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act   the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation   also many states and countries outside the us have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs    under hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers such as us hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business new laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business   additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities the physician payment sunshine act was enacted in law as part of ppaca which imposed new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them directly or indirectly to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members a manufacturers failure to submit timely accurately and completely the required information for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities   the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and

income tax purposes and for the future use of net operating losses we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax asset the valuation allowance reduces deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents managements best estimate of the amount of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized   recent accounting pronouncements   we
