selected child may owe taxes on parent’s ss benefits late because of the train know your workplace rights and the company has plenty of cash on hand for investments and acquisitions last month it completed its biggest acquisition the million purchase of barnes distribution north america a clevelandbased industrial distributor despite its success msc prefers a lowkey image the business is housed in an unassuming onestory white tile and brick building in melville all the offices are the same size no matter the title of the occupant says erik gershwind president and chief executive the only reserved parking is a space set aside to honor the late founder sid jacobson gershwinds grandfather jacobson started the business in brooklyn in  when it was known as sid tool co gershwind  who seldom wears a tie says the informal approach helps to promote the spirit of cooperation which he says is key to mscs success he has worked at the company since  and became just the fourth chief executive in mscs  years when he took the reins jan  so you think the spirit of collaboration and cooperation contributes to morale and the bottom line advertisement  advertise on newsday having people who believe in what you believe in value what you value and really are passionate around the mission of the organization is probably the single most important element of our business whats the toughest challenge facing your business in north america alone the market we compete in is about  billion and the top  competitors including ourselves have only  percent total of the market that creates an amazing growth opportunity for us the challenge that comes with it is the need to stay disciplined it would be easy to get sidetracked to just try to grab everything so there is a strong sense of not just growing for the sake of growing but understanding where we want to grow so that means there are a lot more potential clients and a lot more opportunities for acquisitions yes we see part of our growth coming organically meaning on our own and part of that coming through acquisitions we have a very strong balance sheet we generate a lot of cash so definitely we have a big appetite for growth tweets from httpstwittercomnewsdaybizlistsnewsdaybizstaff what challenges do you face in doing business on long island in particular we love long island i love long island i have grown up here and weve got a very strong talent base here of people who have grown up with the business as we look to position the company in the next five years the next  years the next  years the biggest challenge we saw was access to enough talent particularly enough talent in an industrial business so davidson nc for example where you will soon open a second headquarters has a big enough industrial base that generates enough talent it really does what we decided is we cant and wouldnt abandon long island it was too important too much woven into the fabric of the company but we needed to have an additional location for expansion by  you hope to grow revenue to  billion double the  billion your company first reached in  whats fueling your optimism advertisement  advertise on newsday no  is the market that we compete in the dynamics that i described its a huge market and its highly fragmented theres a tremendous opportunity with those dynamics for larger companies wellrun wellcapitalized companies to take advantage of market dynamics the second thing is we give our customers onestop shopping so we carry  items in inventory and if a customer calls us by  pm theyre going to see their shipment the next day our field sales organization is currently  people with the barnes acquisition we will be at around  and will actually cover every zip code in the us what things do you sell the most of the roots of the company and where my grandfather got started is cutting tools and metalworking supplies thats were the bread and butter of the company has been within metalworking we look at ourselves as the market leader we have a market share of around  percent in the us we carry  items and around half of those are in metalworking your company is growing and hiring mostly off long island is that because of business conditions on long island like higher costs i think its a function of where we can access the industrial talent so we can continue to grow the business advertisement  advertise on newsday you have some impressive academic credentials you graduated summa cum laude with a bachelors in economics from the wharton school of business and magna cum laude from harvard law school given your outstanding academic background are you running the company differently from the way your uncle or your immediate predecessor david sandler did we view this as a relay race so i dont have to come in with any new vision theres a lot of continuity here we also have a strategic planning process that is grounded in principles that have survived years and years certainly any of the four of us operated the business in a different time and in different conditions and theres no question that our growth ambitions of  billion will require some different things than the business did at  billion whats one thing youve learned on the job that neither business school nor law school taught you i would say the biggest thing is the power of a culture to drive performance of having people who believe what you believe and value what you value you cant overestimate that corporate snapshot name erik gershwind president and chief executive of msc industrial direct co in melville

technical training for staff attendees at the  imts trade show crowd the booth of msc industrial supply a company with deep roots in metalworking and manufacturing msc industrial supply co advertisement the great recession saw manufacturing “flipped on its head” erik gershwind president and ceo of msc industrial supply tells a reporter at the imts trade show in chicago as a  billion distribution company that both buys from and sells to manufacturers msc had a closeup view of the pain inflicted on the industry and has used the insights it gained from that experience to fuel a new sense of mission gershwind’s grandfather started the company in  selling cutting tools from the trunk of his car to job shops around new york’s lower east side msc’s close relationship with manufacturing served it well as both grew over the ensuing decades but that same relationship meant msc also felt the sting of the business downturn that started in  “we had quarters where revenues were down  profits were down ” he recalled though a public company msc has a large family ownership interest which allows it to take a longer view of its business wall street wanted the company to cut personnel during the recession company managers saw that as a shortterm fix with longterm repercussions when business improved they believed it would leave them with the task of hiring inexperienced employees who did not know its customers instead msc decided to use the downturn to not only hold onto staff but make investments in its business systems and website gershwind and other executives also spent a good deal of time examining the company’ strategy and how it would drive growth for the next decade prior to the recession says gershwind manufacturer’s purchasing activities had been focused on price and global sourcing but with the recession he said “cash became paramount” companies began to look at their supply chains and found that they had excessive amounts of cash tied up in inventory they were eager to find ways to reduce those nonproductive assets yet manufacturers frequently were operating with smaller staffs in many cases they didn’t have the time or expertise to root out waste those constraints provided an opportunity for msc “we rallied around the mission of improving and optimizing the plant floor” said gershwind while companies had put a good deal of focus on their direct materials costs they often gave less attention to indirect materials – everything from hand tools to cleaning supplies gershwind likens indirect materials to the attic in a house – out of sight messy neglected msc’s says a lack of visibility into the supply chain results in nearly  billion in mro inventory waste annually for us companies the company says it can help companies clean up their “attic” in three ways look for time savings save time and financial savings will follow msc worked with a packaging company that had a large plant in the southeast with a central storeroom for supplies msc audited the facility and found that machine operators were walking a total of a mile to the storeroom and back to get a tool – and doing it sometimes  to  times a day at  per hour msc installed  industrial vending units providing visibility into supply usage and putting the supplies close to workers eliminating the long walks the company saved more than  million with the new system use technology as a flashlight msc offers an inventory management system called controlpoint which provides companies better visibility into the products they purchase and where they are used zf the german manufacturer of driveline and chassis parts implemented the system at one of the pilot plants production increased  but consumption of cutting tools dropped by  gershwind said the visibility the system provided allowed zf to reduce their cutting tool inventory from eight weeks to two weeks the time spent on reporting on cutting tool inventory and costs was reduced from  hours to  minutes get another set of eyes “several hundred of our sales people are metalworking experts” gershwind said “these are people with machinist backgrounds who come out of a manufacturing environment” on one site assessment he recalled one of msc’s experts watched a machine operator who was drilling and then reaming holes in parts when asked why he was doing the extra work the operator explained that the drill couldn’t provide the tight tolerances needed for the part msc’s expert contacted a supplier and found a custom drill that could do the work the result the machine shop saved  annually in labor and raw materials costs msc invests in technical training for staff » next print reprints favorite email tweet please log in or register to post comments advertisement related articlesseco tools ceo
