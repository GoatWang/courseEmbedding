all agree that labs are being inundated with more and more tasks more datarich technologies and the need to develop new strategies for dealing with this new reality just as we have become more efficient in managing our lives think about the impact of smartphones it’s important to apply similar principles of efficiency to conference roundup where we’ve been and where we’re going as our

teams who are struggling with the massive amounts of data that are being generated by modern analytical technologies such as nextgeneration sequencing mass spectrometry cellular imaging fmri and others we understand that there is a critical need to develop a tool that will integrate the disparate and often disjointed scientific software toolkit that is being used and thereby free up the valuable human resources who are currently tasked with doing this we are all scientists from each of our core constituencies who have at one time or another faced the same issues so we bring this intimate knowledge to our development process we are founded on the following core principles understanding the problems faced by biologists bioinformaticians and it professionals bringing extensive

around different datarich workflows esp workflows encompass not only wet lab operations but support full integration of analysis and reporting drastically reducing the amount of it machinery required to manage process and analyze samples esps resource manager maintains data provenance throughout how does esp track samples and manage workflows develop pipelines and automate analysis generate reports and share results keep track of all the data in the system  resource manager lims sample and protocol management the lab esps lims tools are designed to provide full transparency into your operations whether running as a complete lims solution or complementing your existing lims the lab esp streamlines sample tracking and communication between lab technicians managers and scientists the lab esp’s lims functionality gives your laboratory the tools it needs to maintain critical records and forms the basis for the provenance that will be required for downstream reports sample  experiment tracking the lab esp gives stakeholders a detailed view of a sample’s status in its workflow as samples move from the lab into analysis users can view results as they become available directly from the lab esp no more hunting around for spreadsheets or emailing technicians for status reports protocol management in the lab efficient protocol management and data entry are key for maintaining quality and throughput goals a typical ngs lab will have a protocol lims data management bioinformatics variety of protocols it will run to prepare samples for its sequencers as the laboratory moves into more clinical or other regulated environments accurate record keeping along with tracking a sample’s progression through the preparation become stringent requirements protocols

computational and data flow bottlenecks in your existing pipelines and increase performance by x researchgrade pipelines are not productiongrade pipelines many bioinformatics pipelines that start as research projects eventually morph into production tools research projects by their nature tend to be quick and dirty implementations that get the job done as they enter production it is common to simply move research code to a production cluster and run it “asis” while this might initially work as throughput increases research pipelines can quickly become a computational bottleneck limiting the turnaround time for processing samples of course when this happens the original developers might be working on new projects or gone and can’t be called upon to speed things up we make your pipelines productiongrade the dasho “dash ohthree” program is designed to help when you need more performance from your pipelines “o” is a standard compiler option that translates to “use every technique at your disposal to make my program run fast” we apply the same spirit to optimizing your pipelines for production using your existing pipelines we leverage a collection of minimally invasive optimization methods to increase performance and meet your goals like using “o” on your individual programs our process can often find optimizations that increase performance by x information

sep         lab systems inc announced that it has released a free software toolkit and new service offerings for the nextgeneration dna sequencing ngs bioinformatics community along with the latest beta version of its lab dashboard  biobuildstm is a reference collection of open source bioinformatics tools for genomics prebuilt for linux and mac os x platforms  it eliminates the need for users to maintain and build their own versions of these tools  by providing binaries biobuilds also enables users to easily reproduce results by removing version dependencies on underlying software since all tools in biobuilds will be prebuilt for those binariesopen source software is important for bioinformatics said chris mueller phd lab systems’ president and chief technology officer  however building and maintaining open source tools can be a time consuming process  we maintain internal builds of many analytical tools and we feel that making our builds freely available is a good way to give back to the genomics communitybiobuilds is being released in conjunction with the second public beta of the lab dashboard the company’s comprehensive software platform for managing sequencing projects workflows and pipelines  this release includes the production pipeline engine a complete sequence analysis pipeline management and report generation system  the production pipeline engine allows users to easily port existing analysis pipelines into a managed productionready environment  all biobuilds tools are made readily available in the lab dashboard even though the platform is not expressly required to run the toolslab systems also launched its seqsigmatm and dashotm optimization processes integral components of the company’s larger suite of custom services  the seqsigma process utilizes clients’ sequencing and analysis goals to design and implement costeffective computational infrastructures that scale with their labs while the dasho pipeline optimization process identifies computational and dataflow bottlenecks in sequence analysis pipelines and can increase performance by two to tenfold“everything we’re launching today supports our vision of a streamlined environment for the management and analysis of ngs data” concluded dr mueller  “with the tools we’re providing we know that we can reduce the burden on bioinformaticians scientists and clinicians allowing them to refocus their efforts to accelerate scientific discovery and clinical diagnoses” further information       related product news advancing biopsy storage with automationfriendly tubes product news
