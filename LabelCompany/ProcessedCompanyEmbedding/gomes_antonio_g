urgent notifications such as alarms and voice calls were best matched with actuation of the entire display surface while less urgent notifications such as software notifications were best matched to individual corner bends while different corner actuations resulted in significantly different matches between notification types medium urgency notification types were treated as similar and best matched to a single corner bend a followup study suggested that users prefer to dedicate each corner to a specific type of notification users would like to personalize the assignment of corners to

video the memory of a tree interactive art has emerged as a distinctive genre in media art that relies on digital contents to express the artist’s message situated within this field this work presents an approach to multimedia storytelling that allows audience members to control separate but overlapping parts of the story chapters we believe that the system engages its audience with a high level of immersion due to its combination of digital computation and tangibility the tangible system supports a stronger connection to the storytelling than traditional screenbased systems helping to bridge the gap between the physical world and cyberspace within the field of multimedia storytelling consequently it offers significant potential to share storytelling among a group based its immersive

became a middle school student and sometimes she said that she needs to go to the kindergarten to pick me up she kept swimming in her memories that were not organized without noticing who i am or who she is i grab her hands and listen her stories for me she exists here people often say that old creatures also had their beautiful time before they are still beautiful like that dead branch is also beautiful so it seems too hard to define which part of life is more meaningful just through this work i want to say that all creatures blossom in the beauty of each moments involving the moment which
