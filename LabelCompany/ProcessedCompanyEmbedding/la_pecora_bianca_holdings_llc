this restaurant is everything i enjoy about dining in new yorkits spacious but filled with warm decorative details that make it feel cozy has a big bar and wait area perfect for people watching not to mention the food is delicious ordering was tough because everything on the menu sounds appealing but we had the funghi yum and cipolle double yum to start and the seasonal risotto and scallops as main dishes i loved it all and will definitely be going back to try the rest visited october  helpful thank whatididinnyc report ask whatididinnyc about la pecora bianca this review is the subjective

foodie we looked forward to trying this hot new eatery my husband is always happy to have delicious italian foodwell any delicious food regardless of where it comes from the place was heaving with people and our friend admitted he had never been there but it had gotten a lot of buzz since it opened two weeks ago from the service you could tell it was a newly opened establishment it was pretty rough as one reviewer already pointed out the maitre d screamed at us for being late in both english and italian although our friend showed up early our waiter told us how we had to read the menu i refused and he didnt like it i still resisted im literate and can manage to read on my own and listen to his suggestions at the same time all of this we could tolerate if and only if the food was incredible but it wasnt it was far from it we each ordered two courses and one dessert and we tried each others food and each was truly bizarre some were bizarre in a notsobad way but others were bizarre in the way that you either a want to gag or b wish you never stepped foot in this place its been years that we had such a horrific experience we were perplexed as the place was packed i asked my husband do you think they all ordered the good things and we order the bad things but he pointed out that we ordered a number of things even those which the waiter suggested and they were all bad including the parmigiano creme bruleedo not order i asked my husband if he felt that they were focusing on specific regions cuisine his reply no its just bad and i dont know which region would create food so bad i googled it and we laughed to summarize the restaurants about page its local italian from the hudson valley so if anyone is interested in a sheeps milk products and b pricy italianhudson valley food then this is the place is for you for anyone who likes real italian food da evitare a tutti i costi translate to avoid at all costs visited october  value service food helpful thank elena

bright and nicely decorated there is a bar as you enter but also one by the kitchen in back that looks fun to sit at the service was very attentive and knowledgeable about wine pairings even though crowded they did not rush you at all as for food the strozzapreti with pistachios and lemon as well as the onion side dish are superb would definitely go back visited october  value service food

h new york city new york level  contributor  reviews  restaurant reviews  helpful votes “give it another month it will be great” reviewed october   another new place that has been getting a lot of great press its never a good idea to go to a new restaurant soon after it opens because it takes practice to make perfect the service was attentive but quite rough around the edges most importantly though was the food which did not need more practice at all both the appetizers and the pasta were just outstanding we had the crispy octopus  a new take on a pretty trite dish and the roasted figs both were great all the pastas were excellent although they could have been served slightly hotter always a difficult problem with pasta definitely worth trying either for a full dinner or just to stop in for some wine and a bowl of pasta the only risk of waiting for them to work out the kinks is that as word spreads i predict this will become a real hot spot that is difficult to get in visited
