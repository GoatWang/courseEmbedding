rally some sectors are starting to look overvalued the biotech sector remains at quite attractive valuation levelsthe recent pullback has created a unique opportunity to buy into undervalued biotech companies as the fivetotenyear investment outlook for this sector remains compellingfor income investors who wish exposure to biotech buying directly into stocks may not be an option due to the generally low dividends and higher shortterm volatilitytekla healthcare investors is a sensible and diversified product hqh offers the opportunity to share in the longterm upside while providing a relatively steady income yield healthcare  biotech exposure can play a role in every balanced portfolio not only because it provides diversity but also because of its fast growth which is generally not dependent on the state of the economy companies in this sector are able to increase their revenues even during uncertain times such as a recession these are deemed as noncyclical stocks so they are not as much affected during economic downturns the biotech sector an outstanding performer for longterm investors over the past  years the biotech sector tracked by the ishares nasdaq biotechnology etf nasdaqibb has been one of the most profitable and best performing sectors the index is up  since  compared to the sp  tracked by the etf spdr sp  etf nysearcaspy which is up  for the same period the biotech index ibb has outperformed the sp sector by over  this outperformance includes the effect of the recent selloff in biotech stocks after reaching its alltime highs in july  the ishares nasdaq biotechnology has seen substantial declines the selloff was quite severe resulting in ibb losing over  of its value the reasons behind the selloff in the healthcarebiotech stocks the recent biotech pullback was the result of multiple factors the following are the reasons for this selloff high valuations investors in general felt that valuations were getting stretched high valuations especially for a few highly publicized companies have played a major part in the recent selloff for this sector drug pricing policies several questions relating to drug pricing policies by certain healthcare companies have had an impact on healthcare sector sentiment and helped fuel the price declines negative political publicity considerable negative political publicity emerged following the action of a pharmaceutical company that acquired a niche product and quickly implemented more than fold increase in the price of the product concerns about pricing power in the healthcare sector have heightened volatility and downward pressure particularly in situations where pricing may not reflect value to patients at least one presidential candidate has elected to emphasize drug pricing in her campaign weakening sentiment towards the sector and ultimately exacerbating the pullback valeant effect other worries have stemmed from troubles at valeant pharmaceuticals international nysevrx which expanded rapidly by buying companies valeants stock has lost nearly  of its value since august amid concerns about its business and accounting practices this was the latest negative news to affect this sector exaggerated concerns the current concerns about pricing power in the healthcare and biotech industries are overblown the vast majority of healthcare and drug companies prefer to price their new and novel products based on the value they bring to patients therefore most companies try to price their products fairly the negative publicity was the result of few who tarnished the entire image of the sector at the moment the government is limited in its ability to control drug pricing this situation is unlikely to be changing soon reversing trends the sentiment on the biotech sector looks like it is shifting to a more positive one over the past month the biotechnology sector etf ibb has gained over  it seems that investors have started bottom fishing for companies with attractive valuations positive factors in favor of investing in healthcare and biotech now the healthcare and biotech market has been growing at an explosive rate for the last  years in the last couple of years there have been more than  priced ipos raising more than  billion in the sector robust ma activity in the healthcare sector makes it quite attractive total spending on prescription drugs in the us rose  to nearly b in  continuing a steep climb fueled by the introduction of new drugs for cancer and infections the large number of new drugs in the pipelines and strong sales are likely to continue fueling high earnings growth for this sector solid earnings will ultimately result in a more positive sentiment for this sector growing customer base the aging population in the us and globally will increase demand for healthcare and biotechnology it is estimated that the number of americans age  and older will almost double between  and   from  million  of the total population to over  million  of total population beyond america there is an opportunity to export innovative care to new markets with an emerging middle class that previously might not have had access to more costly treatments aging population is a phenomenon currently affecting europe canada japan and several other countries impact of insurance the increase in the number of insured individuals means that more patients will have access to healthcare and will be able to pay for the treatment needed new cures  new opportunities there are several conditions with no effective treatment such as alzheimers  parkinsons new effective treatment would be a game changer for these companies new technological options such as gene therapy and robotic surgery could open the door to improve existing treatment with new methods at the end of the day these companies have the ability to improve the quality of life for millions of people companies that are highly innovative significantly improve patients lives and positively impact the cost structure in the health care sector the result of the selloff most attractive valuations since the selloff which started in september  valuations in the healthcare and biotech sector have dropped markedly let us look at the forward pe ratio of the  biggest biotech companies gilead sciences nasdaqgild amgen inc nasdaqamgn celgene nasdaqcelg and biogen nasdaqbiib these fast growing companies all have their forward pe lower than the weighted basis of the sp  companies which currently stands at x wall street journal source morningstar yahoo finance ycharts wsj the pe ratio for this group has only been below that of the broader index  other times in the last  years based on data from nasdaqcom these companies are set for a fast earnings growth in   compared to the sp  index with a projected earnings decline in q  growth adjusted earnings ie price earnings growth or peg for these  biotech companies is at an attractive level in absolute terms also relative to its own history and to that of the sp  index it is quite attractive to assess how attractive the current valuations are one has to look at these peg ratios see table above these are among the best indicators to value fast growing companies the selloff has resulted in very attractive valuations opening the door for a unique opportunity to buy the shares at a large discount tekla healthcare investors  a sensible product to get exposure to the healthcare  biotech sector tekla healthcare investors nysehqh is a diversified closedend healthcare fund traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker hqh hqh primarily invests in the healthcare industry including biotechnology medical devices and pharmaceuticals the

largest two allocations being to biotechnology  and pharmaceuticals  hqh is a fund structured in the form of an income paying closedend fund it is ideal for those income investors or retirees who want exposure to this fast growing sector while at the same time wish to receive a regular paycheck in addition to the current general attractive valuations in the sector hqh currently offers investors the possibility to buy into the fund at a  discount to net asset value nav the distributions hqh pays quarterly distributions at a rate of  of the funds net assets nav with a  discount the quarterly distribution gets a boost and results in a dividend rate of  instead of the intended  rate based on nav the fund pays distributions primarily from capital gains achieved from its underlying stock holdings however if gains are insufficient to meet the distribution shareholders can be paid return of capital the fund made a return of capital only twice in  almost no eroding returns for over  years hqh has been able to return  annually to shareholders from capital gains and income with no roc except in  quarters even during the worst financial crisis over the long term biotech funds have a history of outperforming the broadmarket indexes during the past seven years the biotech index outperformed the sp  by about  one big advantage of the biotech sector is its relative immunity to economic downturns in fact biotech came out quite well during the  financial crisis it had a shallower pullback and outperformed the sp  during the recovery tekla life sciences investors fund has a solid longterm performance record over the past  years hqh has delivered a capital gain of  plus hefty dividend distributions on a total return basis with dividend reinvested hqh delivered a  return to its shareholders it is worth to note that the sponsor tekla is a successful healthcare fund manager with a proven track record managed hqh since  it is currently the investment adviser for  closedend equity funds including tekla healthcare investors tekla life science investors nysehql difference between tekla healthcare investors and tekla life sciences tekla life sciences is also a closedend fund which invests in the healthcare and biotech however it has a broader mandate than hqh to include more healthcare technology it also has a higher weight to smaller biotech companies as a result hql tends to be a little more volatile than its sister fund hqh over the past  years hqh outperformed hql by  conclusion following the recent general market rally some sectors are starting to look overvalued the biotech sector remains at quite attractive levels the recent pullback has created a very attractive opportunity for investors to buy into undervalued biotech companies as the fivetotenyear investment story for this sector remains compelling this sector warrants a place in a diversified portfolio and can possibly provide some great returns going forward for income investors who wish exposure to biotech buying directly into stocks may not be an option due to the generally low dividends and higher shortterm volatility hqh is a sensible and diversified product which offers
