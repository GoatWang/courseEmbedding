plc nasdaqamrn a biopharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular health today announced financial results for the three months ended march   and provided an update on company operations key amarin achievements through march   include        us revenue growth  recognized  million in net product revenue from vascepa ® icosapent ethyl sales in q  compared to  million in q  an increase of         us prescription growth  increased normalized prescriptions for vascepa by  and  compared to q  based on data from symphony health solutions and ims health respectively        international development  china regulatory authorities approved the vascepa clinical trial application cta from amarins partner eddingpharm paving the way for eddingpharm to commence a clinical trial of vascepa in china before the end of         rd progress  our reduceit cardiovascular outcomes study designed to provide data to support a significantly expanded market opportunity for vascepa is progressing as planned our statistical models indicate that in march  the study reached the onset of approximately  of the target aggregate number of primary cardiovascular events the onset of the target final primary cardiovascular event will likely be reached near the end of  in this  patient study that commenced in         cash flow  net cash outflow from operations during q  was less than  million excluding costs for rd interest and royalty the company aims to be net cash flow positive on this basis for the full year with continued quarterly variability        cash balance  as of march   amarin had a cash balance of  million compared to  million at december   the march  st cash balance includes approximately  million in net cash proceeds from the january  redemption of debt and simultaneous issuance of  million face value of new debt longterm    historically q has been our most challenging quarter for revenue growth due to seasonal factors we are pleased that both revenues and prescriptions for vascepa grew significantly in q as prescription growth exceeded our internal projections we are ontrack to achieve our full year  product revenue guidance of  to  million stated john f thero president and chief executive officer our expectations are that reduceit study results will be reported in mid and we are actively planning for expanded promotion based on anticipated positive results from this study there is a large unmet medical need that we are seeking to address through demonstration of positive results in reduceit we believe the efficacy safety oral administration and affordable cost of vascepa position the product for substantial growth assuming that reduceit results are positive increases in new and recurring prescriptions drive steady commercial growth during the first quarter amarin again experienced substantial prescription growth and continued increase in vascepa market share particularly among detailed physicians overall approximately  patients received prescriptions for vascepa during the quarter with new prescriptions growing to approximately  of the nonstatin lipid modifying market and approaching  of the prescription omega market strong vascepa growth is driven by positive physician experience in conjunction with our focused message delivery compelling efficacy and safety data and improved managed care coverage estimated normalized total vascepa prescriptions based on data from symphony health solutions and ims health totaled approximately  and  respectively for the three months ended march   these prescription levels represent growth of approximately  and  respectively from prior year levels during the first quarter of  overall wholesaler inventory levels decreased from yearend  levels calculated based on estimated days of vascepa sales on hand consequently we estimate that this decrease in wholesaler inventory levels adversely impacted net product revenue by approximately  million to  million for the first quarter of  during the first quarter of  wholesaler inventory levels adversely impacted net product revenue by approximately  million to  million we believe that changes in channel inventory at these independent wholesalers and retail pharmacies are common and impacted by numerous factors including holiday timing and recent order trends we also deduce based on information available to us that channel inventory levels at the end of the first quarters of  and  are within ordinary ranges and that such levels will continue to vary from quarter to quarter reduceit cardiovascular outcomes study the reduceit cardiovascular outcomes trial continues to progress on schedule amarin anticipates the onset of the final primary cardiovascular event to occur near the end of  with report of topline results and publications in  the projected timing of available data from which we can report topline results should be easier to estimate after the interim look which as discussed below is scheduled to complete in q  we currently estimate that we will report results of reduceit in mid assuming the study goes to completion these estimates reflect our assumptions of the necessary time needed to collect vital data from all patients in the study compile the results and subject the results to scrutiny of the independent review committees and the reduceit operational team    the patient outcomes study is evaluating whether treatment with vascepa reduces cardiovascular events in patients who despite stabilized statin therapy have elevated triglyceride levels and other cardiovascular risk factors the results of this important trial if successful could lead to improved medical care for tens of millions of patients amarin is positioned to be the first company to complete an outcomes study in the population of patients being studied in reduceit the primary endpoint of this global doubleblind study is the time to the first occurrence of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events mace results will be compared between the vascepa and placebo groups the study is being conducted under a special protocol assessment spa agreement with the fda preparations are underway for a second prespecified interim efficacy and safety analysis of reduceit by the independent dmc since we believe that approximately  of the primary cardiovascular events occurred in the midmarch timeframe the ensuing analysis should be completed before the end of q  consistent with the trial design amarin continues to believe that the reduceit study is most likely to continue to completion of  of the target events we surmise this because the efficacy requirements detailed to the dmc for early study stoppage after the  interim assessment are high unlike the data analysis at the end of the study the interim analysis and review by the dmc also includes robustness thresholds for certain secondary endpoints there are potential statistical advantages for the study to run to its full term amarin will remain blinded to results of the reduceit study until after the study is stopped and the database is locked at either the  interim analysis or at the final analysis international development of vascepa our international initiatives are progressing positively our partner for china eddingpharm submitted the clinical trial application cta to the chinese regulatory authorities in  this cta was recently approved enables eddingpharm to progress into the clinical testing phase and potentially positions vascepa to be the first prescription grade epa product to receive drug approval in china we believe the commercial opportunity in china is large based on the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia which is estimated to affect  of the adult chinese population our partner in china is responsible for the conduct and cost of the clinical studies in china amarin will provide the clinical trial material for this study financial update net product revenue for the three months ended march   and  was  million and  million respectively this increase in net product revenue was primarily attributable to increases both in new and recurring prescriptions of vascepa driven by increased sales productivity and supported by expanded managed care coverage in addition amarin recognized licensing revenue of  million and  million in the three months ended march   and  respectively related to agreements for the commercialization of vascepa outside the united states based upon current estimates amarin anticipates approximately  million in licensing revenue to be recognized in aggregate during  from existing agreements    cost of goods sold for the three months ended march   and  was  million and  million respectively gross margin on product sales improved to  in the quarter ended march   compared to  in the quarter ended march   the improvement in gross margin on product sales was primarily driven by lower active pharmaceutical ingredient cost selling general and administrative sga expenses in the three months ended march   and  were  million and  million respectively the increase in sga expenses primarily reflects a  million increase in copromotion fees accrued under our contract with kowa pharmaceuticals america inc increased promotional activities and increased legal costs the copromotion fee is calculated based on gross margin on vascepa product sales the increase in copromotion fees primarily reflects an increase during q  compared to q  in gross margin on product sales research and development expenses in the three months ended march   and  were  million and  million respectively this decrease in expense was primarily driven by the timing of reduceit expenses under gaap amarin reported a net loss of  million in the first quarter of  or basic and diluted loss per share of  this net loss included  million in noncash stockbased compensation expense amarin reported a net loss of  million in the first quarter of  or basic and diluted loss per share of  this net loss included  million in noncash stockbased compensation expense

statements are not promises or guarantees and involve substantial risks and uncertainties in particular as disclosed in filings with the us securities and exchange commission amarins ability to
