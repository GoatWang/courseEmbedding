enrichment solutiontweet print agilent nyseahistorical stock chart  month  from jun  to jul  new solution streamlines workflow and eliminates sequencing errors agilent technologies inc nyse a today introduced its newest nextgeneration sequencing ngs library prep solution — agilent sureselectxt hs — a complete target enrichment research solution that provides total workflow management for laboratories from qc to target enrichment to analysis and interpretation sureselectxt hs is a streamlined highsensitivity hs solution for research optimized for labs with a requirement to sequence dna from formalinfixed paraffinembedded ffpe samples which may have degraded over time by incorporating molecular barcodes sureselectxt hs improves overall precision and produces higher complexity libraries than competing products on a broad range of tissue types and low and highquality ffpe samples “this customizable target enrichment technology with integrated molecular barcode error correction enables us to detect ultralow mutation frequencies in very small dna quantities” said dr marco gerlinger of the institute of cancer research and the royale marsden hospital in london “these features make it ideal for the detection and tracking of clonal and subclonal variants in liquid biopsies” sureselectxt hs libraries with higher percentage reads in targeted regions require as little as  ng of starting dna and use molecular barcodes to assist error correction additionally faster and more efficient processing with mastermixed reagents that require less handson time coupled with a minute hybridization — the most rapid hybridization on the market — enables labs to now move from sample to sequencer in a single day “sureselectxt hs provides robust library preparation for lowinput degraded ffpe samples as well as significantly reduced turnaround time” said jeff heimburger head of genomics marketing at agilent “these advances highlight agilent’s continued commitment to alleviating customer pain and improving lab efficiency through innovation” about agilent technologies agilent technologies inc nyse a is a global leader in life sciences diagnostics and applied
