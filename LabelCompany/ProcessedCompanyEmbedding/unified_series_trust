have been sharing boards under series trusts for a decade firms offering the service say the demand has accelerated in recent years because of competition and complex compliance laws series trusts grew in assets to  billion from  billion between  and  according to us bancorp fund services llc of milwaukee the number of participating funds also grew — to  from  — over the same time period as part of a series trust a firm shares a board of trustees chief compliance officer and much of the infrastructure supporting compliance reporting shareholder services transactions and backoffice functions unlimited capacity a series trust is a single registered group comprising multiple separate portfolios each with its own assets and shareholders each portfolio has its own prospectus and is branded to the adviser that manages the funds each has its own name prospectus and shareholder reports or its own identity as far as the public is concerned at us bancorp fund services assets in its three series trusts have tripled to  billion over the past three years the trusts include  different advisers and  funds last year alone they added  funds managers today are facing a complex mutual fund environment said bob kern executive vice president and director of business development at us bancorp fund services they need to find qualified board members and they need to meet sec compliance rules most of the firms involved are startups although some service firms report an increase in interest from standalone firms it can be an alternative to consolidation mr kern said cost savings can range from  to  of operating costs i could spend  for a startup or spend onethird of that in a series trust mr kern said series trusts gained popularity after  amid the proliferation of compliance rules said david bogaert senior vice president of unified fund services inc an indianapolisbased subsidiary of huntington bancshares of columbus ohio the unified fund services trust has  billion in assets up from  million just two years ago the trust has  advisers and  funds the individual fund advisers take care of their own sales and marketing the funds are branded to the advisers becker capital management of portland ore might not have launched its flagship mutual fund in  without using the series trust at unified fund services the asset management firm with about  billion largely in separate accounts has been in business for more than  years it looked into starting a mutual fund in  but it was costprohibitive said patrick becker jr chief investment officer the series trust gave us a lower breakeven point mr becker said the firm launched the becker value equity fund bvefx with just about  million in seed money now its two mutual funds total  million in assets as it scales up we bring the expense ratio down mr becker said the value equity fund is performing in the top  of its category yeartodate and the top  over three years annualized according to morningstar inc of chicago the series trust allows us to just focus on managing the money and concentrate on our business mr becker said the eight mutual funds of dal investment co of san francisco are part of a series trust at us bancorp fund services the funds which total  billion were launched in  and are separate from dals asset management business when we launched the mutual fund we were not sure how much we would get in terms of assets said jason browne portfolio manager at dal it was a new business for us we were not as familiar with the other elements of becoming a mutual fund company the economic benefit can change as the fund grows as weve grown some of the economic benefits are not as significant as they were before said mr browne the series trust is probably more valuable for keeping up with compliance issues than the cost savings the only disadvantage is because we are a funds of funds firm we cannot invest in the funds that are part of the multiple series trust a series trust fund can lose a few points in the stewardship grade with morningstar the fund directors dont invest in the mutual funds they are overseeing said laura lutton a morningstar fund analyst we like to see fund boards invest in the funds its an indication that they are really engaged in the oversight of the funds on the other hand the fact that the funds are saving money is important to the rating email sue
