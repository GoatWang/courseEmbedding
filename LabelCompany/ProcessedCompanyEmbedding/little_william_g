rico better known as little caesar this film also brought douglas fairbanks jrto the attention of the american public both actors are very good in their roles and do confirm that crime does not pay an early talkie fromwarner brothers that was a major boxoffice success depicts the rise and fall of a notorious gangster along with paul muni in scarface and james cagney in public enemy this is one of the bestknown and bestremembered crime films of the early soundera in thes thesethree films made each actor an overnight major star surprisingly the films hold up very well and do not only glorify the gangsters portrayed butalso show their cruelties and vicious behavioral natures cagneys public enemy features the immortal jean harlow in an early role while howardhughes scarface features a young george raft a middleaged boris karloff before frankenstein and a rather large costarring performance by osgood perkins anthony perkins father all highly watchable but little caesars the most immortal
