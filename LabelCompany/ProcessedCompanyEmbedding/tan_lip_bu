design systems  news  morrisanderson morrisanderson what we do industry experience team case studies news about us contact data room  login mercury news interview lipbu tan president and ceo of cadence design systems february     with microchips incorporating increasingly tiny components in ever more complex arrangements the difficulty of making them has grown exponentially in recent years cadence design systems electronic design automation simplifies the process by letting chip firms plot out the manufacturing process beforehand on computerbut the recession slammed the san jose companys business hard its  sales of  million were a little more than half what they were in  hundreds of its employees were let go and in october  ceo michael fister quit under pressure from the boardnow the company is rebounding according to yearold lipbu tan a board member since  who was named ceo in january  a fan of basketball and other sports he has pushed his corporate team to improve customer relations and cadence which has more than  employees  with about  percent of them in the bay area  now lists dozens of job openings on its websitetan discussed his efforts to put cadence on better financial footing during a recent interview which has been edited for length and clarityq what have you emphasized at cadence since becoming ceoa something i feel very passionate about is the culture i strongly feel that the culture of accountability and integrity is very important there is also a lot of focus on product quality and then thirdly its very important to make a decision right or wrong at least make a decision so this company can move forward one of my friends  a very successful ceo  told me that as long as you make  percent of your decisions right you are a good ceoq you have visited a lot with your customers since becoming ceo can you talk a little about thata its been very telling every company i visited i only talked  minutes then the rest i listened what went wrong how can we improve what are the challenges you have can we help you its very important to listen to the customers and make sure we have a solution that addresses their challenges and really focus on the engineering to make sure we have the best product i encourage my team to work together to win and serve the customer and just be humble i think at the end of the day people like someone they can trust and that you listen and you care about their businessq what are the major challenges your customers facea some they face are escalating design costs and some of their chips are getting more and more complex take more time that puts a lot of pressure on the engineersq you picked a tough economic period to try to reconnect with your customersa the best time to help somebody is in a recession in the glory days if you help them so what its in the worst times that they really need help i think that is something we accomplishedq your predecessor had tried unsuccessfully to buy cadences rival mentor graphics then in may last year you announced a  million cash deal to buy denali software an electronic design automation company in sunnyvale do you see your industry as fertile ground for such mergersa i think in general industry consolidation is always good but being a basketball player i always believe let the game come to you do what you like to do to strengthen your position and when the occasion comes the opportunity comes you are prepared to take the right move denali is a good example we are very pleased with that acquisition they were very profitable and we loved thatq although microchip sales last year were dramatically higher than they were in  you have noted that your business often lags behind that of chipmakers so how is cadence doinga its starting to grow this year we are looking for it to be a good year overall we are excited we look at our customer engagement in rd new projects and that has substantially increased from last year that is a good indication there is a lot of growth in new areas you look at smart meters you look at cleantech and power efficiency and the gaming platform is just humongous i mention to my team that  was a

mentor purchased rights to an aptix patent then sued cadence in this case the ceo of aptix amr mohsen forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger when suspicions were raised he staged

a pile of cash while in jail for this offense he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge in order to fight the new charges he tried to feign psychological problems but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense and how it might be done he was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency but was convicted anyway according

software to interoperate with the companys tools lawsuitsedit avanti corporationedit main article cadence design systems inc v avanti corp cadence was involved in a yearlong legal dispute with avanti corporation in which cadence claimed avanti stole cadence code and avanti denied it according to business week the avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of whitecollar crime in the history of silicon valley the avanti executives eventually pleaded no contest and cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution avanti was then purchased by synopsys which paid  million more to settle the remaining claims the case resulted in a number of legal precedents mentor graphicsedit the cadence group quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with mentor graphicsaptix mentor purchased rights to an aptix patent then sued cadence in this case the ceo of aptix amr mohsen forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger when suspicions were raised he staged a breakin of his own car to get rid of the evidence resulting in charges of obstruction of justice trying to avoid this he attempted to flee the country only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash while in jail for this offense he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge in order to fight the new charges he tried to feign psychological problems but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense and how it might be done he was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency but was convicted anyway according to the lawyers concerned the original notebooks were not needed for the trial the patent filing date which was not in dispute would have sufficed acquisitionsedit timelineedit may  acquired cooper

founders were l curtis widdoes tom mcwilliams and jeff rubin all of whom had worked on the s supercomputer project at livermore labs valid acquired several companies such as telesis pcb layout analog design tools and calma ic layout in turn valid was acquired by cadence design systems in the early s valid built both hardware and software for schematic capture logic simulation static timing analysis and packaging much of the initial software base derived from scald structured computeraided logic design a set of tools developed to support the design of the s supercomputer at lawrence livermore national laboratory later valid expanded into ic design tools and into printed circuit board layout at first valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary unix workstation the scaldsystem with static timing analysis simulation and packaging running on a vax or ibmcompatible mainframe however by the mids general purpose workstations were powerful enough significantly cheaper companies
