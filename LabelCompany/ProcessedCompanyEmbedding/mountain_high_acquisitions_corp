appreciate what d has brought to the table so quickly the solutions we intend to provide to the cannabis industry solve real problems faced by licensed growers and producers  having a license is not a

come in  by providing swift access to affordable turnkey solutions not only do we greatly reduce setup time and costs and help growers get growing we also help them to minimize risk and optimize their business    as a part of this initial pilot myhi will lease its first two containers to d for use in licensed grow operations in arizona and california  grow operations in the containers are expected to begin within  days  initial harvests are anticipated to occur  days later this particular pilot project will allow the company to test both the revenue model—acquiring and leasing infrastructure solutions to licensed growers—and the equipment itself  in this case the equipment being leased out consists of intermodal containers that can be geared for cultivation or for extraction depending upon how the container is built out trending facebook just gave a glimpse into one of its big new business areas tesla headlines this lineup of  amazing new cars for  apples iphone  is coming and it
