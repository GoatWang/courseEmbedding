compared to the yearago period average revenue per ton increases by  compared to the yearago period  adjusted ebitda guidance increases to m management comments despite abnormally soft winter heating demand the cnxc team delivered very strong operational and financial results during the first quarter of  we were able to achieve nearrecord sales and production volumes higher revenue per ton and solid cost performance said jimmy brock chief executive officer of cnx coal resources gp llc the general partner the results also reflect the second consecutive quarter of yearoveryear earnings growth strong coverage ratio and continued reduction in indebtedness since we completed the acquisition of additional interest in the pennsylvania mining complex pamc in the third quarter of  i am also pleased to announce that the complex is exceeding the management teams expectations for incremental earnings contribution since the acquisition on the safety front our central preparation plant continued its excellent performance by working another quarter without an exception this achievement marks the eighth consecutive exceptionfree quarter for the plant the mining operations were also able to improve their safety performance by reducing their number of exceptions by  compared to the same period last year safety is our top value and we continue to seek further improvement sales  marketing in spite of another mild winter our coal sales improved substantially during the first quarter compared to the yearago period as higher natural gas prices and more normal coal inventory levels supported improved demand from our domestic power plant customers furthermore tighter supplydemand fundamentals in the international coal markets also led to increased volumes and pricing for our crossover metallurgical and thermal coal exports during the first quarter sales volumes increased in all three of our primary market areas  domestic thermal export thermal and export crossover metallurgical  compared to the yearago period specifically we posted nearrecord sales of  million tons in the first quarter vs  million tons in the yearago period on the domestic front henry hub spot natural gas prices averaged mmbtu for the first quarter up  from the average of mmbtu in the yearago quarter moreover us coalfired power plant inventories stood at  million tons at the beginning of  down  from  million tons at the beginning of   these factors helped to support solid first quarter shipments of pamc coal to our domestic thermal coal customers which were up by about  thousand tons yearoveryear  on the export front market conditions were muchimproved in the first quarter compared to the yearago period with the global coking coal benchmark up by about  and the api index for coal delivered into europe up by more than  this stronger export pricing drove an increase in our overall revenue per ton which reached  in the first quarter compared to  for the yearago period the first quarter of  was the secondwarmest on record for the lower  states  this exerted downward pressure on power prices throughout the quarter which led to a slowdown in domestic customer shipments and contracting activity during the latter part of the quarter  however our marketing team continues to work with customers to stay on pace and take advantage of higher natural gas prices that have sustained into the shoulder period  during the first quarter cnxc was successful in signing an annual contract with a new customer as the enduser looked for an alternative supplier to help transition away from central appalachian coal in the international markets we continue to ship volumes into the crossover metallurgical coal market and we increased our first quarter crossover volume by  yearoveryear  based on our updated coal sales guidance range we are approximately  contracted for  and  contracted for  we believe our contracted position is wellbalanced in hedging against market downside risk while allowing us to continue to build out the portfolio strategically and opportunistically as the market evolves looking forward there is a growing consensus that increasing natural gas exports and modestly increasing domestic demand will tighten the supplydemand balance and drive up natural gas prices with eia now projecting that the henry hub spot natural gas price will average mmbtu in  and grow to mmbtu in  our coalfired customer plants are expected to dispatch well at these prices eia now projects that electric power sector coal consumption will improve by  million tons in  relative to  levels as coal recaptures share from gas in the generation mix furthermore eia projects that yearend power plant coal inventories will remain below  million tons in both  and  in the more immediate term cyclone debbie which made landfall on march   has caused a substantial disruption in coal exports from australia with one of the countrys key rail lines impaired for approximately one month and recently reopened at reduced capacity  we expect that this will help to support continued demand for our export products in the nearterm as international metallurgical coal spot prices have risen rapidly and thermal coal demand could also see some benefit as more crossover tons move into the metallurgical market we will continue to capitalize on our broad market reach and our lowcost flexible operations to maximize margins as these market opportunities unfold quarterly distribution during the first quarter cnxc generated net cash provided by operating activities of  million and distributable cash flow of  million yielding a distribution coverage ratio of x we note that our distribution coverage ratio calculation is based on the estimated maintenance capital expenditure of  million while our actual cash maintenance capital expenditure for the first quarter was  million based on our current outlook for the coal markets and distributable cash flow generated during the quarter the board of directors of the general partner has elected to pay a cash distribution  per unit to all limited partner unitholders and the holder of the general partner interest the board of directors has also approved a full cash distribution of approximately  per unit to the holders of the convertible class a preferred units  the distribution to all unitholders of the

operations team delivered strong production volumes for the quarter despite two longwall moves at bailey mine and tough geological conditions at enlow fork mine with domestic and international demand remaining strong for most of the quarter our marketing team was successful in lining up a nearrecord shipment schedule the operations team took advantage of this opportunity and mobilized additional shifts during the weekends to deliver a strong first quarter production looking forward we expect geological conditions at enlow fork mine to improve in the second quarter as we have moved past some of the most difficult geology and production is expected to normalize we sold  million tons of coal during the first quarter of  compared to  million tons in the year ago period the average realized price improved by  compared to the yearago period as the pricing on export shipments improved significantly our total cost of coal sold increased to  million during the first quarter compared to  million in the yearago quarter driven primarily by higher coal sales volume the average cost of coal sold in the quarter increased  to  per ton compared to  per ton in the yearago quarter the increase in unit costs was driven by mobilization of additional resources for the development of longwall panels demanding geological conditions at enlow fork mine and increased equipment maintenance compared to yearago quarter despite this increase in our average cost of coal sold our average cash margin per ton sold improved by  compared to the yearago quarter due to higher average realized price three
