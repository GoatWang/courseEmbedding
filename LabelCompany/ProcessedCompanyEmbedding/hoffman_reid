successfully emailed the post × linkedin cofounder reid hoffman explains what everyone gets wrong about his signature advice richard feloni jun    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print be embarrassed by your product launch doesnt mean be deeply ashamed or alienate all your userssteve jenningsgetty images linkedin cofounder and chairman and greylock partners investor reid hoffman has a reputation as one of silicon valleys wisest thought leaders and one of his most repeated entrepreneurial insights of the last decade is if youre not embarrassed by your first product release youve released it too late its got all the right elements of a good quote its pithy controversial and has fans like facebook ceo mark zuckerberg whose own signature motto is move fast and break things but these characteristics also make it easy to misinterpret over the years some people have have interpreted my theory as permission to cut corners act recklessly or proceed without a clear plan hoffman said in the zuckerberg episode of his podcast masters of scale but notice i said if youre not embarrassed by your product i didnt say if youre not indicted or if youre not deeply ashamed by your product indeed if you launch so fast that it generates lawsuits alienates users or burns through capital without any apparent gain you did in fact launch too soon the core of hoffmans message is the embrace of fast experimentation as he wrote on his blog when he was an entrepreneur in the s it was very difficult to do this because not only was the production of technology slower and more expensive but customers had to pay premium prices for software that they downloaded to their computers from a disc they purchased in a brickandmortar store with the spread of internet access and an improved consumer experience hoffman and other entrepreneurs were then able to move faster and see what their audience liked and didnt like he said in his podcast that entrepreneurs should feel embarrassment a feeling that their vision is not fully realized for every new product release whether they have  users or  billion users zuckerberg explained to hoffman the way he has made peace with the idea that he doesnt need his vision perfected in new releases at facebook im much more motivated by making sure that we have the biggest impact on the world than by building a business or making sure we dont fail i have more fear in my life that we arent going to maximize the opportunity that we have than that we mess something up and the business goes badly you need to be comfortable as an entrepreneur with upsetting a portion of your target audience — whether you introduce a new social media site or a new kitchen appliance — so that you can learn what the majority wants according to hoffman the opportunity to build an enduring product far outweighs the cost of alienating a few users along the way he said and the sooner you internalize that tradeoff the faster youll move along the path to scale you can listen to the full episode of masters of scale on stitcher or wherever you get podcasts see also facebook coo sheryl sandberg says a phone call with mark zuckerberg after her

your company look like by bartie scott bartie scott is a reporter for inc and an alumna of the university of tennessee and new york university she lives in brooklyn new york bartielouscott reporter incbartielouscott  comments credit when most of us think of artificial intelligence in the workplace we imagine automated assembly lines of robots managed by an algorithm linkedins reid hoffman has a different idea in an essay for mit sloan management review hoffman describes human applications for the technology among other things it would help to use data science to improve the way we onboard new team members organize workflow and communicate about performance addressing the question of how technology will change management practices over the next five years hoffman explains how the use of a knowledge graph will become standard management practice imagine a spider chart mapping the complex web of interactions and data transfers within your company ai can process large amounts of files emails and data providing unprecedented access to information about how we delegate work tackle assignments and deliver results this kind of oversight can sound intimidating and many skeptics worry about invasion of privacy and worker displacement with the rise of ai but hoffman like techindustry colleagues including sam altman elon musk peter thiel and jessica livingston is a proponent of the openai project which seeks to develop technology that will help not harm humanity here are three ways he thinks ai could help your office run more smoothly  faster onboarding new hires spend weeks getting up to speedmeeting with new colleagues reading through files and navigating internal processes hoffman says a knowledge graph full of information gathered before the new employee was hired can answer questions like who do i need to work with on the new office move what were the meetings where it was discussed when is our next status meeting simple questions perhaps but with dozens of such hurdles and no knowledge of company processes a new employee would save time having a digital repository for the minutiae of orientation  more efficient workflow forget emailed meeting recaps ai as hoffman sees it will process decisions and assignments made in the conference room and integrate them into the knowledge graph he points out that the technology for classification and pattern matching already exists as demonstrated by googles search box autocomplete and amazons product recommendations in addition to linking decisions with assignments and steps needed to complete a project hoffman thinks ai has the potential to measure less tangible workplace influences he envisions a dashboard that combs internal communication to assess workplace sentiment knowing what issues are being discussed most frequently what concerns are most often analyzed and how financial and emotional capital are used could provide a valuable layer of insight for managers hoffman credits joi ito director of the mit media lab for the term extended intelligence or treating intelligence as a network phenomenon and using ai to enhance rather than replace human intelligence  objective performance reviews hoffman cites a staggering figure from a deloitte study that found only  percent of organizations said annual performance reviews were worth the effort they require while some jobs are easier to measurewidgets sold new customers acquiredwhat counts as success in most positions is more subjective differing opinions workplace politics and unconscious bias take their toll on performance reviews a knowledge web could capture every tiny detail of who proposed a key idea in a longago meeting and who managed the tasks to make it happen if performance management were a movie it will become less gladiator and more moneyball hoffman writes to be clear he doesnt see an end to the need for people skills at work and human judgment in reviews but he argues ai can help managers objectively identify patterns in workers strengths and weaknesses that can then help managers make assignment decisions published on jul   want to be great embrace embarrassment advice on imperfection from reid hoffman
