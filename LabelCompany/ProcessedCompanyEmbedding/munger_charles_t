feedback top customer reviews out of  starsencyclopaedia of lessons on how to be successful a pricey book but worth buyingbybrad revellon august  format hardcoververified purchasepoor charlies almanac has been on my reading list for the last couple of years it took me a sixmonth sabbatical and then some to get through it this is a testament to the information lessons references and stories from charlie munger fundamentally this book is an encyclopedia of information on what it takes to be successful and to achieve greatness in what it is you want to do in life all from a very successful and extremely well read and connected ish year old billionairelets be clear this is not a book that you can quickly skim through but rather a book you spend quality time with every day for a good couple of months this way youre giving yourself the best change of retaining all of charlies tidbits of wisdom one of the great things about this book is the plethora of quotes from successful entrepreneurs historians philosophers alike whose ideas and writings have survived the test of timesuffice to say this is one of those books im going to reread reference and quote for the rest of my life well worth a purchasethree key takeaways from the book charlie knows no wise people who didnt read all the time it is more than just reading though one has to grab ideas and do sensible things most people do not identify ideas and if they do they do not know what to do with them diversification in investing is something that charlie doesnt believe in his recommendation is to choose three good company stocks and invest accordingly interesting approach given most financial advisors typically recommend the opposite selfpity is always counterproductive its the wrong way to think and when you avoid it you get a great advantage over everybody else or almost everybody else because selfpity is a standard response and you can train yourself out of itread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review

points of viewbymichael georgeon may  format hardcoververified purchasei felt that mr munger and the others who contributed to this book really communicated a feel for someone who had a brilliant mind and acquired practical wisdom from a very young age his clear practical perspective ability to synthesize many disparate elements into a coherent theory and his broad multidisciplinary farreaching approach to life come through very clearly i think too one gets a sense of someone who wants to make the world a better place i struggled in places because i am unfamiliar with the business world that he haunted most of his career on the other hand i do feel that i learned some significant things about business and investing i thought his attacks on the lack of practicality in the science of psychology also helped me to see a little better his points of view on life the idea of going down a check list and the idea of using a lattice of theories to help him seemed very important his quickness and brilliance shines through in this book despite the fact that he was not young when he worked on it there is also a sense in which he avoids and has been able to avoid some of the very painful sides to life that many other people have not the book displays the impact of a thinker very broad quick and brilliant in scope i can recommend the book on this basis as it does give some insight into a particular way of life and an effective powerful and practical point of viewread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of

financial marketsvalue investingi have read over  books on related subjects  no book has influenced my thought process more that this one it is simply amazingyou will not get the value from this book when you close the last page but when you see the world relate in the ways munger lays out for you this is one of the greatest minds and business and he tells you his secrets the last chapter on the psychology of human misjudgment will live on past mungers days it is his greatest work and is invaluable information the way your brain fires and works will literally physically change over time from the things this book teaches you its a mind trainer  it teaches you how to look at problems it is worth its weight in platinumi dont care who you are you need to buy this and pound his ideas in your

the harvard legal aid bureau in college and the army he developed an important skill card playing “what you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you or if you have a big edge back it heavily because you dont get a big edge often opportunity comes but it doesnt come often so seize it when it does come” investment careeredit he moved with his family to california where he joined

appreciation rate for the dow munger was previously the chairman of wesco financial corporation now a wholly owned subsidiary of berkshire hathaway it began as a savings and loan association but eventually grew to control precision steel corp cort furniture leasing kansas bankers surety company and other ventures wesco financial also held a concentrated equity portfolio of over us billion in companies such as cocacola wells fargo procter  gamble kraft foods us bancorp and goldman sachs munger believes that holding a concentrated number of stocks that he knows extremely well will in the long term produce superior returns wesco is based in pasadena california mungers adopted hometown pasadena was also the site of the companys annual shareholders meeting which were typically held on the wednesday or thursday after the more famous berkshire hathaway annual meeting mungers meetings were nearly as legendary in the investment community as those he cohosts with buffett in omaha such meetings were often perfunctory but munger interacted with the other wesco shareholders at considerable length sometimes speculating about what his hero benjamin franklin would do in a given situation meeting notes have been posted on the futile finance website but no updates exist beyond  investment philosophyedit elementary worldly wisdomedit in multiple speeches and in the book poor charlies almanack munger has introduced the concept of elementary worldly wisdom as it relates to business and finance mungers worldly wisdom consists of a set of mental models framed as a latticework to help solve critical business problems munger along with buffett is one of the main inspirations behind the book seeking wisdom from darwin to munger author peter bevelin explained his key learnings from both munger and buffett in a  interview how to think about businesses and investing how to behave in life the importance of ethics and honesty how to approach problems but foremost how to reduce the chance of meeting problems bevelin stated that previously he was lacking the munger ability to unlearn my own bestloved ideas high ethical standards are integral to mungers philosophy and at the  wesco financial corporation annual meeting he said good businesses are ethical businesses a business model that relies on trickery is doomed to fail during an interview and qa session at harvardwestlake school on january   munger referred to american philosopher charles frankel in his discussion on the financial crisis of – and the philosophy of responsibility munger explained that frankel believed the system is responsible in proportion to the degree that the people who make the decisions bear the consequences so to charlie frankel you don’t create a loan system where all the people who make the loans promptly dump them on somebody else through lies and twaddle and they don’t bear the responsibility when the loans are good or bad to frankel that is amoral that is an irresponsible system lollapalooza effectedit munger uses the term lollapalooza effect for multiple biases tendencies or mental models acting at the same time in the same direction with the lollapalooza effect itself a mental model the result is often extreme due to the confluence of the mental models biases or tendencies acting together greatly increasing the likelihood of acting irrationallycitation needed during a talk at harvard in  entitled the psychology of human misjudgment munger mentions tupperware parties and open outcry auctions where he explained three four five of these things work together and it turns human brains into mush meaning that normal people will be highly likely to succumb to the multiple irrational tendencies acting in the same direction in the tupperware party you have reciprocation consistency and commitment tendency and social proof the hostess gave the party and the tendency is to reciprocate you say you like certain products during the party so purchasing would be consistent with views youve committed to other people are buying which is the social proof in the open outcry auction there is social proof of others bidding reciprocation tendency commitment to buying the item and deprivation superreaction syndrome ie sense of loss the latter is an individuals sense of loss of what he believe should be or is his these biases often occur at either conscious or subconscious level and in both microeconomic and macroeconomic scale personal lifeedit from his first marriage to nancy huggins munger is a father of  living children
