leadership  management  things to know about geisingers new ceo dr david feinberg written by molly gamble and tamara rosin  february    print  email david feinberg md former ucla hospital system ceo was appointed to take the top seat at danville pabased geisinger health system on monday a handson clinician leader dr feinberg says after studying geisinger for the last six years he cannot be more excited for the new role here are  things to know about dr feinberg  dr feinberg  assumed his post as ceo of ucla hospital system in  he will begin his tenure as geisingers sixth ceo on may  replacing glenn steele md phd dr steele has led the system since   dr feinberg is triple boardcertified in child and adolescent psychiatry adult psychiatry and addiction psychiatry his areas of clinical expertise include attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and adolescent substance abuse he plans to continue seeing patients at geisinger  dr feinbergs leadership style is distinct in that he makes an effort to remain accessible to patients even sharing his business card and cell phone number when i got this job i went into patient rooms because i was really scared he told beckers hospital review in  there was a lot about running a large academic medical center that i didnt know i spent time with patients to decrease my anxiety — it was something i knew how to do now i visit patients because its the most fun part of the job  dr feinberg admits traditional ways new leaders meet their new staff and fit into the culture arent his style i like to get to know the people on the frontlines you can find me in the kitchen talking to the cooking staff and nutritionists or in the halls with the nurses he says according to dr feinberg the most valuable tool a leader has is his ears and the best way to learn about a new organization is to listen to the people providing the care  when he assumed his role at ucla two out of three patients would not refer the system to a friend patient satisfaction scores grew from the th to th percentile under dr feinbergs tenure but he expressed the need for further improvement im the most critical of all — th percentile patient satisfaction sucks he told beckers that puts us in th percentile among hospitals so  out of  patients would recommend us to family or friends all that means to me is that we have failed miserably with  patients and families and i wanted those patients treated like my family im critical of myself everyday we cant ever mess up we need  out of  patients to be satisfied and it has to stay that way this th percentile is terrible but its much better than where we started  dr feinberg earned his undergraduate degree at the university of california berkeley he graduated with distinction from the chicago medical school and completed an internship in pediatrics at loyola university medical center and residency and fellowship training in psychiatry and child psychiatry at the ucla school of medicine dr feinberg earned his mba from pepperdine university in malibu calif  geisinger is known for its physicianled structure and innovations to improve patient care and access ucla health system has and continues to deliver a range of innovations bolstered by its institute for innovation in health there are a lot of paths into our innovation center some ideas come from those working directly in innovation they might have a brand new idea or they might have seen something somewhere else that might make sense at ucla so they bring it into the council dr feinberg told beckers in  or it could come from anyone in the workforce we try to really be out there looking for ideas from the frontline  dr feinberg is insistent that innovation does not always mean reinventing the wheel in  the system standardized a common greeting to incoming phone calls this is ucla health would you like to be seen today cleveland clinic has been answering phones this way for years dr feinberg said on a phone call we want to make that model specific to ucla but also say hey look were humble we didnt come up with this on our own  dr feinberg gave a tedx talk in  about the patient experience and his singular focus on the patient illustrated with personal vignettes dr feinberg discusses the opportunity for improving the quality of healthcare simply by increasing focus on the patient experience  dr feinberg welcomes the move to pennsylvania — despite the arctic cold the east is experiencing his wife andrea also a physician is originally from new york both of their children currently live on the east coast with one living in new york and the other attending the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia  copyright asc communications  interested in linking to or reprinting this content view our

engagementacospopulation healthlegal  regulatorycompensationpayer issuesopioidsrankings and ratings leadership  management the corner office dr david feinberg on raising the patient experience to a whole new level written by tamara rosin twitter  google   december    print  email david t feinberg md was named president and ceo of geisinger in february  in the almost year since he took over leadership of geisinger from glenn steele md phd dr feinberg has redefined what customer service looks like in healthcare in an unprecedented move he spearheaded the evolution of the healthcare warranty through its new program provenexperience part of geisingers provencare portfolio the health system offers patients refunds if their expectations for kindness and compassion are not met despite warnings against such a program from executive peers in healthcare and other industries dr feinberg ultimately decided provenexperiences refund policy is simply the next practical and necessary step toward a truly patientcentered care model    prior to joining geisinger dr feinberg served as president and ceo of the ucla health system he is triple board certified in child and adolescent psychiatry adult psychiatry and addiction psychiatry he has published numerous professional articles and chapters and he speaks publicly on many topics including the patient experience attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder autism pediatric bipolar disorder pediatric depression adolescent substance abuse and the industrialization of medicine here dr feinberg took the time to answer beckers hospital reviews seven questions note these responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity whats one thing that really piqued your interest in healthcare  being able to connect with people what do you enjoy most about danville  joining geisinger has been incredible from a professional standpoint from a personal standpoint coming from beverly hills it has certainly been a transition there is less traffic and fewer restaurants — but there are some good ones my family and i are loving living in central pennsylvania if you could eliminate one of the healthcare industrys problems overnight which would it be  i would like to eliminate the waiting room and everything it represents a waiting room means were providercentered — it means the doctor is the most important person and everyone is on his or her time we build up inventory for that doctor — that is the patients in the waiting room to be truly patientcentered we need to get rid of the waiting room when your child is suicidal or your wife has breast cancer or your parent fell down in the bathroom and theyre bleeding the last thing you want to do is sit and wait we need to increase access and availability so we can show people we see it is a privilege to take care of them — to tell patients we are waiting for you what do you consider your greatest talent or skill outside of the csuite  i dont think i have many skills within the csuite im just one of  people that make up geisinger health system we get up every day night holiday and every weekend to be part of the healing team when people ask me about worklife balance i say my work is my life and my life is my work and i couldnt be happier there is a real blurring of the lines there that may seem like the wrong answer to todays generation but for me its very comfortable how do you revitalize yourself  i overexercise — sometimes almost to the point of injury i do cardio lifting stretching and walking and every other moment i have i want to spend with my family whats one piece of advice you remember most clearly  i had a great mentor when i took on my leadership role at ucla hospital system he told me to just pick one thing to fix in the organization and focus on that in leadership roles so much comes your way that if you try to do everything you wont be able to do anything that one thing i wanted to move the needle on at ucla which i did with the great support of the institution was to make the system more patientcentered now that im at geisinger i think about the advice everyone gives you as a systems new leader — to go around and listen and dont try to do anything i spent a lot of time listening and it was clear to me that one thing we needed to do was take the incredible success geisinger has had and make sure patients get just what they need ensure patients get what they need and are served with compassion — that was great advice that my mentor gave me about  years ago what do you consider your greatest achievement at geisinger so far  i dont think its mine but ive been a part of it — rolling out provenexperience to us its an extension of our provencare portfolio that started in  it was quoted as surgery with a warranty by the new york times geisinger employed provencare around illness then the medical home and chronic care we launched provenexperience a month ago except this encompasses the whole concept of the care experience it includes sameday appointments people answering the phone and treating patients with dignity and respect we are also redoing our hospital bill because we have a health insurance company this means you will get a bill you understand if we dont live up to any of those things we will give you your money back whether we did it right or wrong — we will take the same kind of retail approach like starbucks or nordstrom if you think we didnt do something right well apologize refund your money and correct it for the next patient its an exciting thing that is part of in my first threequarters of a year at geisinger     more articles on leadership and managementwhy were so intrigued by generous ceoshealthcare companies surpass apple and google
