against sherman financial group cant move forward as a class action a federal judge in indianapolis has ruled us district judge tanya pratt said circumstances vary too much among class members and individual proof would be needed for each class member to support their claims that sherman subsidiaries didnt own consumers debt when they tried to collect it the legal action was originally filed nov   while the decision discusses legal standards for class action certification the key point was that after three years of litigation and discovery the plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that their debts were actually securitized the order states that underlying the argument that defendants did not own the plaintiffs debts is the plaintiffs understanding of the effects of securitization on the debts plaintiffs allege that shortly after a consumer assumes a debt obligation or receivable the originating bank through subsidiaries pools the receivable with others into a financial instrument that can be sold to outside investors which results in the creation of an assetbacked security similar private companies by industry company name region  energy fund inc united states  class corp
