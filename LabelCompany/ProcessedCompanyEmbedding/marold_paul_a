odors reduce energy requirements and improve equipment efficiency the  products are used in hospitals office buildings industrial plants laboratories pharmaceutical facilities schools museums and sports arenas clean rooms and hospitals approximately  percent of the company’s business is in the healthcare sector which includes hospitals operating rooms assisted living facilities and other facilities where air quality and odor are concerns “within healthcare facilities the full offering of air filtration products can be used from prefilters to capture dust particles and allergens through high efficiency hepa filters for operating rooms to molecular or ‘gasphase’ filters to help manage odors” clarcor air president paul marold points out “clarcor air is one of the only manufacturers that offer all of these options to the healthcare segment” other clarcor air filtration products are used in the clean rooms where electronic chips with microscopic patterns are manufactured and in massive data centers where the servers can be compromised through contaminated air clarcor air filters are also used in manufacturing plants in paint spray booths and for the electronics that run digital billboards those filters have to outlast the elements for approximately one year before replacement “whether for biosafety pharmaceutical manufacturing or even in silicon valley you’ll see our filters utilized” marold summarizes “we sell exclusively through our distributor partners who are very regional in nature” he continues “if you have a concentration of a particular industry – for example in the dallas area there might be a high level of data centers so that would be a focus area for our partner in dallas in houston our distributor there is quite strong in petrochemical in new york city it’s more commercial buildings our business is truly regional in nature and as a result of that for a key market segment specific to one of our regional distributors we will develop a product for them so they can be more competitive” product development and modification is done at clarcor air filtration products headquarters in jeffersonville but basic product research is performed at the clarcor filtration research center cfrc in cincinnati cfrc provides discovery and development research for all of the clarcor companies as a means of leveraging new advancements in air or liquid filtration manufacturing improvements clarcor air filtration products has been streamlining its manufacturing operations extensively “we have updated and invested quite heavily in our company over the last five years with many automated operations” marold points out “although due to the very specific nature of some of our products there is still a lot of manual labor involved” the company has also invested in new pleating operations “we have a number of unique pleating technologies that are available only through us giving our distributors an improved filter for their customers” he says “we’re also investing heavily in lean or continuous improvement throughout our organization we are putting the lean principles of continuous improvement in place this year we just started our journey but we’re already seeing many dividends as a result of these efforts” waste has been reduced in the manufacturing process – especially the waste of skill “what we’ve seen by improvement of our ‘right firsttime’ manufacturing is that we are reducing the amount of time we have to use skilled operators doing quality checks of materials that may be manufactured incorrectly” marold says “we’d rather have those skilled laborers making filters instead of inspecting filters so we’ve seen a lot of improvement there” every aspect of the materials used and the manufacturing process is being scrutinized “we are streamlining our manufacturing processes and challenging some of the heritage supply chains that were in place before” marold says “we are working with our media partners as well as our adhesives suppliers to examine the best products for our filter applications and challenging them to provide materials to us that will help create differentiated products for our customers among the filter media in clarcor air products are synthetics and nonwovens that combine microglass and cellulose “we have over  skus many of them custom for specific applications” marold points out “we have to have a lot of flexibility in our operations we have quick changeovers but they are not as quick as we’d like” reduce variety marold indicates his company’s average delivery time for standard products is five days to maintain this clarcor air must have reliable and prompt suppliers among the material replenishment methods clarcor air’s suppliers use are justintime consignment agreements and vendormanaged inventory “we really do have key partners as our suppliers and work closely to make sure our operations and needs are integrated with their capacity so we can shorten supply chains” marold says clarcor air filtration products is working to standardize the sizes forms quality and efficiency of filters so it will not have as many skus “many of them overlap” marold declares “we’re finding as many as  different products that could be used in the same application” this education also is being extended through the sales force and distributor partners ranked among the top five filter manufacturers in the united states clarcor air is also competing against a host of smaller regional companies “we have one of the broadest product offerings available in air filtration” marold maintains consequently besides the other four major competitors – each of whom he estimates to have from  to  percent of the market – the company is competing against a number of suppliers on the low end three to four competitors on the high end and one or two on specialty products most of whom are different companies for the future marold anticipates clarcor air filtration products expanding its sales of highend products in china asia india and south america “we’re not satisfied in being one of the top five” marold asserts “we want to be no  to do that we have to expand our offerings i think it’s a very exciting industry as people are looking at indoor air quality providing improvement in air filtration certainly is going to be a big part of that we’re looking at significantly greater growth for this company and capturing market share with our company’s technologies” check out our latest edition subscribe for free   archive tweets by
