authenticity in accordance with one embodiment of the inventiondetailed description of the inventionwhy track and trace technology is importantcounterfeit drugs currently account for between b to b in losses for the pharmaceutical industry projected to significantly increase as the black market evolves over the next decade and those dollar losses do not account for the damage to public health due to these lifethreatening illegitimate drugs or the societal impact of resulting increases to health care costs the dollar losses also do not account for the damage to drug brands that causes the general public to lose faith in the products designed to restore their health track and trace offers the industry and consumers a method to discern between counterfeit drugs and their genuine counterpartsadditionally pharmaceutical track and trace benefits also include track and trace as a facilitator to communication between drug supply chain participantstrack and trace as a way to push active or automated updates on drug information to an end consumer such as a recall notice or expiration noticetrack and trace as an early detection system for drug package tampering track and trace has been shown to deliver significant and tangible benefits examples of that which track and trace protects are a consumers health manufacturers business and jobs brand public health and the affordability of health care track and trace has a clear potential to positively change the world we live inexisting problems with track and trace technology adoptionwith the fda amendments act fdaaa of  the fda was required to create a track and trace standard for regulated products with no implementation deadline imposed by congress they have not created that standard to date track and trace solutions have been explored independently by states and manufacturers the best implementation having been codified in california epedigree law however despite all the benefits demonstrated by existing track and trace solutions there has been no broad market adoption of track and trace to date this is due to the current legal and technological state of track and trace specifically current track and trace standards when they exist are incompatible between states and manufacturers that implement different track and trace standardsbased on fda invitation for commentary in  players throughout the pharmaceutical industry supply chain are divided on implementation details of any proposed federal standard for track and tracebecause of the divided industry commentary the fda is itself unclear how to proceed in drafting a standard within practical meritspharmaceutical companies are currently in a holding pattern in the absence of a federal regulatory standard unwilling to commit resources to implementing track and trace solutions now in fear of future change in regulation that may render existing track and trace infrastructure obsolete and that would require expensive infrastructural change existing track and trace solutions have been too restrictive to the end consumer for broad market adaptation it is not clear to the average consumer whose level of education varies significantly what to do with a drug package serial number to protect their health if they are even able to find it or know to find itproblems with existing track and trace technologies themselvesthe major categories of existing track and trace technologies arerfid—“major pharmaceutical brands like pfizer are leading the way with their viagra rfid track  trace solution per bottle level across the usa” track  trace pharmaceuticals frost  sullivan radiofrequency identification rfid has long been used in drug manufacturing as a way to keep track of products as they move throughout a warehouse however rfid has little use beyond the manufacturing warehouse as distributors and especially consumers typically lack the hardware necessary to read rfid tags much less know what to do with the serialized string of alphanumeric characters rfid tags encode furthermore rfid is the most expensive track and trace method with tags costing between  to  per drug package and their nonubiquitous readers costing hundredsd bar codes—“the sni is printed in a twodimensional d data matrix bar code” trackandtrace drug verification nih  a drug sni standard numerical identifier is often printed on a d data matrix bar code the most common type of which is a qr code the advantage of d bar codes over rfid is that they are ubiquitously readable by cameraenabled smart phones and hence more accessible to supply chain parties beyond the manufacturing warehouse however these codes are currently being used only to store serialized strings of alphanumeric characters and still pose the problem of being unintelligible beyond the point of manufacturethey are problematic because they are not accessible beyond point of manufacture hardware for reading rfid is not ubiquitous for either rfid or d bar codes the extra step of having to transcribe the raw sni to reference elsewhere presents accessibility problems for supply chain participants beyond manufacturernot intelligible beyond point of manufacture for either rfid or d bar codes the extra step of a selfdirected search to reference the raw sni presents intelligibility problems especially for less educated or underrepresented consumers alternative solutions to consumer intelligibility like sms verification are costprohibitive for all partiescostprohibitive significant cost for itemlevel rfid tags for drug packaging even more significant considering special hardware required d bar code representations of snis bear significant cost whenever regulation changes or even when drugs are shipped between jurisdictions with differing serial number standards due to the infrastructural cost of having to change the physical codes themselveslow resolution tracking the high cost of track and trace incentivizes manufacturers to use lotlevel tracking instead of itemlevel trackingfuture infrastructural changes needed manufacturers must change their core infrastructure and operational procedures whenever new regulation is introduced costing millions for system hardware or software replacements alone enterprise software must be updated or replaced resulting in additional consulting and integration fees the current technology available for identifying products on packaging tries to distill all of the relevant information into a single number the meaning of which is not intuitively obvious especially to the end consumerone embodiment of the present invention eliminates challenges posed by existing track and trace solutions by using a url in place of a raw sni unique to each drug package each url directs to a landing page with data specific to the associated drug that can be updated in real time this “smart packaging” approach is futureproof due to the technologys use of webpages that can be instantly updated to comply with current regulations the invention allows for recalls to be managed more efficiently which not only means less liability but also less loss of human life the invention provides immediate value to biomedical manufacturers and consumers and can benefit all supplychain participants in the future it provides an opportunity to scientifically understand how different users consume and share information between different points in the supplychainthis technology at its core leverages the agility and ubiquity of open web standards and mobile technology to make it costeffective and easy for manufacturers to comply with the changing landscape of fda track and trace regulation no expensive infrastructural or operational changes as the industry currently fears are necessary for a manufacturer using the codes generated by this system and method the ability to easily change the content and even the structure of any drug packages representative landing page to fit any new standard has significant potential to break the biomedical industrys current inertia with respect to track and trace implementationthe web page for each drug package may include status safety guidelines instructions for use or any other relevant content accessible and understandable to the average person furthermore because the urls are printed at the item level the information viewed by a consumer after entering the url is tailored to that package that batch of the product or even potentially the consumer who purchased the product a tremendous advantage the inventions generated codes have over raw serial numbers is that the manufacturer can dynamically alter the content on the web page for each drug package in the event of a recall for example it would be possible to flag the pages for only the affected packages customers scan the qr codes to see if their particular product is affectedfor the purposes of this patent the adjective biomedical is used to describe anything of or relating to biology andor medicine biomedical products might be any items used by doctors or patients for the purpose of promoting health and wellness and may include chemical compounds used to treat or prevent illness ie drugs and other biomedical products as well as instruments or objects used in the course of practicing medicine eg surgical devices diagnostic hardwarein the biomedical industry track and trace refers to the process of determining the current and past locations of drug or medical device products the location of a product can mean either a physical geolocation or the part of the supply chain the product has been or is currently being handled in specifically tracking refers to knowing the current location of a product and anticipating its future destinations while tracing refers to recording and being able to retrieve the previous locations a product has been in or passed through track and trace processes often generate an epedigree for a product which is defined as an electronic document containing all of the information necessary for a drug pedigree a drug pedigree is defined by the fda as “a statement of origin that identifies each prior sale purchase or trade of a drug including the dates of those transactions and the names and addresses of all parties to them”  fr  for the purpose of this patent it is useful to consider an epedigree to be the electronic document recording the passage of the product through the supply chain the term supply chain refers to all entities responsible for getting the product from its point of manufacture to its point of use or consumption including but not limited to the manufacturer and consumerproduct authenticity information refers to any data indicative of a products identification at any level whether it is the item level package level batch level group level product level product type level product classification level etc an example of an item level identification for a product is the serialized numerical identifier sni as defined by the fda for drug packages the sni is one way to provide a unique drug identification at the level of a saleable unit another example of an item level identification is the electronic product code epc as defined by epcglobal inc another example of an item level identification is the unique device identifier udi as defined by the fda for medical devices the sni epc or udi are just few of many ways to provide a unique drug or medical device identification an example of a product level identification is the national drug code ndc also as defined by the fda another example of a product level identification is the global trade identification number gtin as defined by gs an example of a product type level identification is the stockkeeping unit sku as widely used in industryproduct safety information refers to any data indicative of precautionary step communicated to the consumer by the manufacturer other supplychain participant or other organization comprising risks in product usage hazards potential side effects disposal potential risk factors for diseases associated with the product etc an example of this would be a warning such as “keep away from children under ” or “do not take if you are pregnant” such product safety information can originate from any supplychain participant or third parties such as a government agency grassroots organization etc examples of organizations that have a mission for public safety and may issue notices are the united states consumer product safety commission occupational safety and health administration osha the surgeon general the american public health association apha etc product safety information may also include actionable directives such as “contact your healthcare professional if you experience asphyxiation after using this drug”regulation required data refers to product data that is required by regulatory guidelines from regulatory agencies that regulate the product in question examples of regulatory agencies are the food and drug administration fda federal trade commission ftc federal communications commission fcc regulation required data may also include reference to whichever agency or the legal code that governs the necessity of the data presented examples of product data that fall under regulation required data are a serialized numerical identifier sni for drug packages as instructed by the fda or a unique device identifier udi for medical devices as instructed by the fda another example of product data that is required by the specific state jurisdiction of california is a drug products epedigree as defined by the california department of consumer affairs board of pharmacyindividually unique qr codes that encode a unique url directing to an individual landing page may be printed on external packaging of a biomedical product such as paperboard packaging or a bottle it may also be printed on an instructions for use ifu document safety instruction document product manual legal disclaimer or any other type of media that accompanies or is contained in packagingunique links are distinct references to an internet resource which are commonly called uniform resource locators urls unique links can be represented in many different forms but the most typical form is a character string that follows some translatable pattern most commonly “schemedomainportpathquerystringfragmentid” unique links could also be represented as twodimensional image such as a quick response code qr code any other form of representing a reference to an internet resource is contemplated under the definition of a unique link unique links can also be represented in shortened form using various urlshortening techniques for example one urlshortening technique is to apply a hashing function to a long url to generate a sixcharacter hashing result string the resultant string then forms a new url in conjunction with a shortened domain whose function is to maintain a database of long urls and their shortened forms and perform forwarding operations in response to web server requestsone aspect of the invention relates to the process of generating unique links various methods can be used to generate unique links for example within the example domain “domain” a unique link may look like “domainjgje” and another may look like “domainhje” the subdomain segment of an url may also be used such as “tjdomaincom” or “hghdomaincom” in the example case of “domainjgje” the last six characters represent the distinguishably unique segment of the unique link one example way to generate these characters is to implement a random generator of character alphanumeric strings another way to generate these characters is to build a hash function that takes as input some content related to the destination of the url and maps it to the space of character alphanumeric strings for example one could apply a hashing function to the title of the destination web page to generate a unique link another possible way to generate unique links is to use a simple alphanumeric system and provision the url extensions in alphanumeric order one example of this is a pure sequential numeric generator that outputs “” “” “” “” “”     “” in succession another example of this is a sequential alphabetic generator that outputs “aaa” “aab” “aac” “aad”     “zzz” in succession yet another example of this is a sequential alphanumeric generator that outputs “aaa” “aaa”     “zzz” in succession yet another example of this may also employ the use of a hierarchy of base folders such as “johnaaa” “johnaaa”     “peterzzz” in succession one of skill in the art will recognize that these methods can be modified or combined to produce other valid schemes for unique url generation within a domaindepending on the technique used there may be variations in the number of possible unique links that can be generated variations in the quality of the unique links generated or variations in the number of collisions of unique links generated if a larger space of possible unique links is desired the limitation of  characters can be lifted to allow any variable number of characters for example if instead an implementation of  alphanumeric characters is used instead of  alphanumeric characters the space of possible unique links would grow from   billion permutations to  × permutations the quality of unique links generated can be determined based on factors that affect the use case for example if the use case is such that unique links are being generated for people to recall from memory the quality of the unique links generated would positively trend with its simplicity in that particular case a randomlygenerated character alphanumeric string would be considered a lowquality unique link whereby a sequentiallygenerated character alphanumeric string “” “”     “zzz” would be considered a highquality unique link invariably a technique that is engineered to generate high quality unique links may also be more limiting in the space of possible unique links as applied to the last example for the character alphanumeric string technique a highquality technique for the use case of memory recall the space of possible unique links is  only  permutations whereby for the character alphanumeric string technique a lowquality technique for the given use case the space of possible unique links is   billion permutations finally it is noted that another variable in generating unique links is the collision probability this variable is especially relevant in certain use cases in which generating unique links must be fast and frequent as in any application of hashing functions one of the most important qualities of a hashing function is the minimization of its collision frequency in the examples previously cited the sequentiallygenerated character alphanumeric string methods collision frequency is  because by virtue of being sequentially generated the generator simply increments the most recently generated string by one and guarantee no collision if using a hashing function on some destination content the collision frequency simply approaches the collision frequency of the hashing function itself if using a random character alphanumeric generator for example collision frequency would approach  mobile devices include iphone android blackberry a digital camera like the sony cybershot panasonic lumix nikon coolpix casio exilim canon powershot a mobile tablet like the ipad a mobile industrial device like the motorola mc or psion teklogix or any personal computer one of skill in the art will recognize that there are many other possible devices all of which fall within the scope of this invention a mobile computing device is most effective if it is able to electromagnetically communicate with other devices over a network means to communicate electromagnetically with other devices may include wired communication such as sending electromagnetic signals through ethernet wire coaxial cable wire fiber optic wire copper wire platinum wires and the like wireless communication such as sending radio signals visible light laser gamma rays xrays microwaves ultraviolet waves and the like the communication may follow one or more protocols of communication protocols that include but are not limited to tcpip udp icmp imap smtp ftp http or https being “networkenabled” typically means being able to communicate with one or more other devices that are able to interpret the communication protocols that the digital media capture device use the computing device is also most effective if it is able to communicate with one or more databases a database could be contained within the computing device itself as a component or it could be a remote database that the computing device communicates with using any of the electromagnetic communications means described above a database for the purposes of understanding this invention should be able to persist data representing connections and its meta data it may use conventional database engines to handle and query the persisted data such as by using mysql postgres sybase sqlite oracle or other such database enginesone aspect of the invention relates to a system for managing the destinations of unique connections a connection is a data structure that manages at least one landing page and directs or routes visitors to one or more landing pages the connection may direct a recipient user to a landing page set up by another user of the system to serve relevant content to that recipient user landing pages may be “owned” by the connection in a onetoone relationship or a connection could own more than one landing page in a onetomany relationship any given landing page could also be shared between multiple connections in a manytomany relationship each connection may be configurable through a computerimplemented interface the purpose of the connection may for example be for a manufacturer to send a recall notice to an end consumer the data published can be a text note a datetime stamp a geolocation a combination of these or other such content that is used to capture the circumstances of a situation like that it could for example be a date and time stamp of when the most recent electronic version of an ifu document was previously accessed via a unique landing pageone aspect of the invention relates to setting up a default landing page for a connection the connection can direct a visitor to the default landing page as its primary function this can be accomplished by storing in a database the location of a default landing page that is owned and editable by the user of the system who also owns the connection the default landing page can for example allow the owning user to post information about the associated product that is typically posted to the product website it could also contain links to web documents hosted at other sites as well such as a vendors giving the landing page an aggregation role and serving as a directory of the associated products web presenceone aspect of the invention relates to reconfiguring connections to direct a visitor to content located elsewhere the content can be stored at and retrieved from another location on the internet or stored and retrieved locally on the computing device on which the system resides the reconfiguration of connections to point a visitor elsewhere can be achieved through a connection management interface whereby a user of the system can select a connection to edit and specify an override to the ultimate destination of the connection the system can achieve the override through various methods such as url redirection in a web application server redirection domain forwarding etcone aspect of the invention relates to counting clicks for connections a click is any single instance of a visitation to the connection click counting can be implemented on the application level whereby a connection resource request causes a subroutine to be executed in which an integer stored in the database and related to the owning user of the connection is incremented it could also be implemented at the web server level whereby a server log of requests to a particular resource of an owning user is aggregated and countedone aspect of the invention relates to adding digital content to a unique landing page for a visitor digital content means any content in computerreadable format such as photo files video files audio files text document files text messages screenshots scripts computer programs news articles gossip blog posts podcasts forums reviews research articles research publications wikis animations games game playergenerated content digital security certificates and other such contentone aspect of the invention relates to controlling privacy of the content associated with a connection one way this could be implemented is by blocking access to all of the connections contentthe invention for pharmaceutical track and trace includes the step of creating and deploying unique links on printed media ie an itemlevel qr web link on drug packaging which when scanned directs to a landing page serving as an actionable data component in lieu of an inert serial number the technology may be implemented at the packaging and printing manufacturer point in the drug supply chain to be used throughout the rest of the supply chain the invention is best integrated into a manufacturers operations and calibrated to achieve a production throughput that at least matches the manufacturers existing operational throughput for the direct printing of standardized numerical identifiers snis for biomedical packages to achieve this the manufacturer must set up a device or system of devices to be able to a generate unique codes and initialize legally required data associated with each individual code that is related to the individual biomedical package to which it has been assigned additionally the manufacturer must have computing capability for the system to be able to b update any of the data in real time in response to changes in drug status both steps a and b must be able to keep up with the manufacturers rate of production and rate of updating for example a drug manufacturer may process  drug packages per minute at the facility so the system should be calibrated to handle that throughputto generate and initialize codes at a speed that meets manufacturing throughput expectations at mass scale a code initiator software component is written to do the following expose a rest http web service api that can retrieve and write data in reference to the code for a particular drug package with the following functional endpoints implementedcreate new code returns codeidadd ’” in order to provide more specific information through the landing page for the viewer the supply chain participant rule can be constructed using a conjunction of supply chain participant data regulation required data and user role data it can even take into account other external data such as from a third party database and even situational data such as current datetime or landing page viewer geolocation the supply chain participant data can come from any supply chain participant including but not limited to manufacturer wholesaler distributor and even the consumer via writing to the landing page interface or through a corresponding landing page api hence the supply chain participant rule can be based on data that comes from any player or user role within the supply chainuser role rules are based on the user role of the scanning supply chain participant who will scan the qr code in step  these rules allow two users to see different information or have different permissions to modify the same product for instance a user identified as the product manufacturer might have the option to update the product instructions for use or to issue a recall but might not be shown where the item was purchased a consumer on the other hand might have the option of answering questions on his or her experience with the product but would not be able to issue a recall a distributer might be shown more or less of the products epedigree than the consumer or the manufacturerin step  the supply chain participant who scans the qr code is identified with some user role this can be done via a login or lack thereof some users might be required to have user data stored to authenticate their permissions whereas other users might be allowed anonymous access to some limited version of the landing pagefinally in step  the regulation requirement rule supply chain participant rule and user role rules are all applied either serially or in parallel to shaping the content and structure of the landing page that is viewed by the scanning supply chain participantfig  is a block diagram of an exemplary system  for receiving and distributing product information to members of the supply chain in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the system  may correspond to but is not limited to being a computer system such as a desktop laptop tablet pc handheld mobile device and the like the system  includes a central processor  a memory unit  which loads one or more programs  and  network cloud  a printer  a display  a communication link  a device capable of scanning a qr code and sending andor retrieving information  and a database for storing product information when the system is in operation the memory unit  is loaded with one or more routines while the system is in operation data can be loaded into this memory unit  adhoc perhaps as a result of a data caching operation or other operation that requires such placement of datathe processor  is a hardware component configured to execute instructions and carry out operations associated with computer system  examples of such a processor could be a cpu of any architecture cisc risc edge bit bit bit etc a combination of cpus of any architecture performing operations in parallel a combination of specialized cpus such as a microcontroller coupled with a digital signal processor the hardware of which is efficiently designed to process certain signals such as graphics in a gpu or perhaps a vector processor or any other processing device that can carry out the task of executing instructions and carrying out operations associated with verification system the communications link  can be any method of exchanging data between the processor the database and the receiving device including but not limited to a physical connection a wireless network connection g g a cloud service or a virtual communication link such as between host operating system and virtual operating system network communication is achieved by connecting the processor  to network cloud  the processor is then able to communicate with remote printer  one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the network cloud could be implemented in the same way as communications link  additionally it could include an implementation of internal procedures for how to deal with manufacturing hardware such as a printer the printer  is representative of industrialgrade hardware that is instructed by the processor —protocols for sending printer instructions comprise http lpt ftp or other such ways to communicate with industrial printing machinerythe database  is any unit capable of storing sharing and updating product information including identification and authentication information and the epedigree information generated as the product moves through the supply chain the data may be stored in any structure some possibilities include a relational database eg sap oracle mysql postgresql ibm db microsoft sql server sqlite a nosql database such as mongodb or writable files in a file systemfig  shows a potential supply chain for the distribution of biomedical products the manufacturer  is defined as the entity which creates the product and the consumer  is the entity which ultimately uses the product for its intended purpose the consumer may be someone uninvolved in the medical profession who purchases over the counter or prescription drugs the consumer may also be a doctor surgeon or other medical professional who uses a biomedical product to diagnose or treat a patient in the interim steps between the manufacturer and the consumer other entities may participate some entities which may involve themselves in the supply chain include but are not limited to a wholesaler  who purchases the product directly from the manufacturer one or more distributors  who transport the product and a pharmacy  or other retail store where consumers are able to purchase the product the consumer could be a patient who has a prescription for a drug to pick up at a pharmacy staff at a hospital such as a surgeon that regularly procure supplies for usage in the emergency room such as surgical tools etc the invention can accommodate an arbitrary number of participants in the supply chain with each potentially having their own qualifications allowing them to view unique information on the product upon scanning the code printed on the productfig  shows three different packages of the same product   and  are functionally identical each containing the same quantity of the same product and having the same branding etc the only difference lies in   and  three unique qr codes printed on the respective packages like d barcodes or id numbers printed on packages each qr code is an itemlevel identifier of the packagein one embodiment of the invention each of   and  encode a unique uniform resource locator url each of which references a unique landing page for the individual package the codeurl correspond to creating a onetoone connection between the consumer who purchased the product and the other members of the supply chainfig  shows an example of a landing page a customer might view upon scanning the unique code including dynamic content and identifying information is one or more pieces of dynamic content dynamic content is defined as information which might be changed after the sale of the product by the manufacturer or by some other entity involved in the supply chain and which might vary depending on the credentials of the user viewing it ie between a consumer who scans the code and a distributor who scans the codein a case where the invention was being used for anticounterfeiting measures the dynamic content might say ‘verified’ if the product met the requirements to establish it was not counterfeit or ‘warning’ if the product did not meet these requirements  might also display further information on how the verification was established or if the verification was not established information on actions the consumer could take in regards to their counterfeit product in a case where the invention was being used in a recall situation location  might display ‘safe’ if the product was not part of a recalled batch or ‘recalled’ if the product were part of a recalled batch  might display further information on where to return the product if it was recalled in a case where the invention was being used to track that the instructions for use ifu for a product had been read  might read ‘not read’ if the user had not viewed the ifu since the publication of the latest version or ‘read’ if the user had viewed the most current version of the ifuthe dynamic content displayed might vary for individual instances of the same product it might also vary based on the credentials of the person accessing the page ie the manufacturer might see an option to place a recall while the consumer sees only whether it has been recalled or notin the event that the dynamic content on a product landing page displays actionable information eg that the product is counterfeit a recall has been placed on the products or the ifu for the product has not been read by the consumer the manufacturer could supply a recommended action for the user to take this could take the form of a text note link button etc for example in a recall situation the dynamic content may indicate where the consumer can return the product to get a replacement or refund in a counterfeit situation the consumer may be given a phone number or email to report the counterfeit product to or in a situation where an updated ifu has been published the consumer may be provided with a link to the most recent ifu     and  are pieces of static identifying information which may vary between products identifying information is defined as information which is specific to an item but should not change after the sale of the product identifying information might include product authenticity information  which is defined as information unique to the item eg a standardized numerical identifier sni national drug code ndc or a code assigned based on an interindustry numerical standard such as sku gtin or upd identifying information might also include grouping information  grouping information is information used to relate this item to other instances of the same product eg a lot number or a batch number identifying information might also include information from the epedigree of the item in question    about its journey through the supply chain information from the epedigree might include some manner of identifying the consumer who purchased the product the store at which the product was sold the distributor who provided the product to the store etc information from the epedigree might also include information on when the product was transitioned between members of the supply chain eg placed in retail outlet by distributor purchased by customer from retail outlet identifying information might also include safety information known at the time of manufacture such as the expiration date of the productevery landing page which has a url encoded in one of the qr codes printed on some piece of packaging can potentially include both dynamic content and id infofig  shows a potential implementation of the invention for anticounterfeiting purposes in this embodiment the qr code is printed on the inside of the packaging and cannot be accessed without obviously tampering with the package upon opening a package the consumer scans the qr code  with a smart phone tablet or other appropriate device the system records that the code has been scanned what entity along the supply chain has scanned it and where the device that scanned it was located at the time of the scanning if the code has never been scanned before that implies that this package has never been opened by a consumer and that no duplicates of this code exist the landing page might therefore display some dynamic content similar to  if however this code has previously been scanned by a consumer the landing page might display dynamic content as in  with an alert that this product might be counterfeit along with the date and location of the previous scan the consumer can use this information to authenticate their product if the date and location match with a previous scan that the consumer performed then the product is still safe to use if however the consumer knows that shehe never scanned the code before or did not scan it at the listed time or location then there must be a duplicate instance of the code and this product is therefore not being distributed through the proper channels the dynamic content in  might also include instructions on where to report or return counterfeit productsin this embodiment of the invention the identification information  and  which might include an sni number batch number expiration date etc is displayed on the landing page regardless of whether the product is marked safe or bears a counterfeit warningfig  shows a potential implementation of the invention in a recall situation a recall would be placed by the manufacturer on certain groups of the product which would be defined by some predetermined sorting method such as lots batches date of production etc consumers would then scan the unique qr code  on their product packages using a smart phone tablet or other appropriate device to view the landing page for their product  shows an instance where the product is not part of the affected group the dynamic content would display an alert informing the consumer that the product is safe to use  shows an instance where the product is part of the affected group in this case the dynamic content would display an alert to inform the consumer that the product they have is part of the recall it might also include information on where the product should be returned to if a refund or replacement is being offereda recall situation might also take advantage of other members of the supply chain to manage the return of recalled products for instance a pharmacist or distributor receiving product returns might scan the codes of said products and mark them as ‘returned’ making it easier to track the number of recalled items still on shelves or in the hands of consumers a manufacturer accessing the landing page for an item through that items qr code or through their own database might see an alert such as in  informing them that the item has been returnedin some embodiments of the invention the qr code might be printed in multiple places on the packaging fig  demonstrates this qr code  is located on the outer packaging while  an identical qr code is printed on the products interior packaging material the outer packaging is defined as anything visible without opening or tampering with a package eg paperboard bottle box foil the interior packaging is defined as anything which the outer package must be opened to access eg ifu product manual safety information brochuresalternatively there may be unique qr codes printed on the outer and inner packaging of a product ie  and  are different in this case the two qr codes although linked to the same product may serve different purposes for example the qr code  on the interior material might only be meant to be scanned by the consumer being inaccessible without opening the package it could be easily used in the anticounterfeiting measures described above meanwhile the qr code  on the outer packaging is less useful for that particular implementation of anticounterfeiting measures since it can be easily scanned without opening the package perhaps by consumers wishing to find out more about the product before they buy it however because it is easily accessible it can be used by other participants on the supply chain without opening the product packaging to log items as having passed through certain check points or pass other information up or down the supply chainfig  shows a potential implementation of the invention which would allow consumers easy access to electronic instructions for use eifus for products such as surgical equipment scanning the qr code  in that case would display dynamic content indicating that the consumer either has  or has not  read the latest version of the ifu as well as providing a link or download of the ifu if the consumer has viewed the ifu through that linkdownload the dynamic content will indicate that they have read the latest version of the ifu however if the consumer has never accessed this page before or if a new version of the ifu the most recent electronic version of the ifu has been published since the last time the consumer viewed the ifu the dynamic content will indicate that the consumer should read the current ifu before using the productthis implementation could also provide an interface for the manufacturer or other entities along the supply chain to monitor whether consumers of the product had read the ifu and to publish updated versions of the ifu for a product  when an update is published consumers and other entities involved in the supply chain would once again see that the current version of the ifu had not been read by the consumer  fig  illustrates another embodiment of this invention which could make ifus or other supplementary material more accessible to the consumer by using geolocation to determine the appropriate language to present said material in in this embodiment upon either scanning the qr code following a link or requesting to download the material the consumer would be prompted to either choose their region from a map drop down etc or enable geolocation  based on the physical position of the device which performs the scan the material would be presented either exclusively or initially in an appropriate language to the consumer  one embodiment of the present invention is a collaborative method for tracking and tracing a biomedical product the method involves concerted usage of a printer component such as an industrial label printing machine an electronic network communication channel such as broadband or wireless internet one or more application servers and one or more database servers a server comprises at least a computer processor memory secondary storage and network connectivity hardware that is capable of transmitting and receiving electronic signals on the electronic network communication channel this method is carried out by multiple supply chain participants each assuming a user role that governs their interactive actions upon biomedical product datathe printer component is used to print regulation required data onto individual biomedical product packages it should be noted also that this product packaging can fully enclose the biomedical product item so the printing need not be on the item itself this is generally done by the manufacturer user role within the supply chain for a biomedical product this involves sending over the network to a printer an electronic command to print along with the data to print the data could be an image of a drug label or an image of a medical device label in the regulatory required format for a medical device this would be a device label that comprises the trademarked name of the device a reference number lot number a useby date indication of whether it is single use temperature limits “do not use if package is damaged” warnings or other warnings quantity indicator manufacturer business name address phone number web url scannable bar code sketch of the device and industrystandard symbols representing various properties of the devicethe printer component is also used to print a scannable quick response qr code on each product items packaging the qr code can represent raw alphanumeric data or it could represent a url when the qr code represents a url it has the advantage of not being limited in the amount of data it can hold since the url is simply a link and effectively shifts responsibility of data dissemination to the server that responds to the url request when invoked the response to an invocation of the url is a landing page on which there is regulation required data which can repeat the data that is physically printed on the product item label and may include more specific data not found on the product item label most importantly this landing page can include the most recent version of data such as the most recent version of an electronic instructions for use ifu document which is important for data that changes over timethe printer could print the same qr code on the packaging of all product items however it is most effective if the printer prints a unique qr code on each package this is done by using a code generator to create peritem codes and configuring a web server to respond to urls that include this code an example url would be httptestcomgu whereby gu is the code the codes may be randomly or purposely generated and are stored in a database with subsequently generated codes checked against the database for collisions this way when the url above is invoked a lookup is done for the code gu and data associated with that code is returned as a structured response the structured response could be a landing page represented in html or it could be a json data object an xml document or even an encrypted string the structured response could even include other urls made available to further invoke instead of or in addition to printing unique qr codes representing unique urls the printer could print the unique url itself on the packagesupply chain participants interact with the product items bearing this printed code by scanning the printed code with a smartphone transcribing the url or using other codereading machinery before doing so a supply chain participant could identify herself by authenticating or can simply scan anonymously each supply chain participant invokes the url generally to read the data associated with the individual product item but also has the option to write data an example of this is if the supply chain participant is a patient and is writing how he feels after taking the drug item—he may write “i feel wonderful” which may be done by utilizing a text box within the landing page returned by the first invocation of the url hitting a “send” button may invoke another or the same url that sends the data via a post request along with post data a script on the server would process the post request for the “i feel wonderful” data which is then written to the database and associated with the particular drug item when a supply chain participant writes data using the url he may also include a directive such as “warning” “comment” “feedback” “immediate help requested” or others a directive is a metadata component that accompanies the supply chain participant data that helps other supply chain participants further understand what the data means or what they should do with it the system that transacts the product item data may interpret the directive in various ways for example a “warning” directive that comes from a manufacturer posting information about side effects recently discovered regarding an outstanding drug item may cause the system to display large red warning text on drug item landing pages such as “warning do not take this drug if you are pregnant” the same supply chain participant data without the accompanying “warning” directive may just simply display “do not take this drug if you are pregnant” on the landing page in plain vanilla format ie without any alterations to font color font size position on the page etcthe nature of having each individually unique url for each product item serve as a readwrite mechanism especially for data writes to be made from any supply chain participant having identified themselves by role is an important featurethe method makes use of rules that govern the structure and content of landing pages these rules are implemented as data objects that contain a predicate and consequence the parts of a conditional if    then statement a rules engine such as jboss drools is used to manage a set of rules and run a process that fires the rules based on an event feed additionally rules are categorized and placed into appropriate rule sets the rules can be architected to be order independent or follow a priorityordered execution stack dynamic rules are created as data is submitted to the system through the url by supply chain participants static rules are created before the system is even up and running—they would be inherent rules within the system initializing a rule involves loading the rule into a running rules engine subroutines memory static rules may be created before the host system is in operation and initialized when the rule engine is first started while dynamic rules may be both created and initialized while the rules engine is runningone type of rule is a regulation rule that reacts to regulation required data the nature of having each individually unique landing page for each product item react to the current state of the regulatory data dissemination requirements of a governing body that apply to the product item is a muchneeded feature currently industry does not get along well with any change in the state of regulation due to the traditionally large cost of infrastructure change to comply with the regulation change which is why there is inertia in the state of track and trace guidelines from the fda this step is the key to solving the industry inertia because it is what enables the invention to be agile toward changing regulation by encoding the regulation required data in easily updatable rule set for example if the fda tomorrow came up with a format guideline for a drug packages epedigree to be encoded as a json response a rule set would be created in the rules system that would look something like this “rule when client requests epedigree data ep intercept the original request and return tojsonep” the regulation rule can govern either the structure content or even presentation of regulation required data on the landing page presentation can be expressed as something like “rule when client requests landing page return tohtmltablesni batchno expdate fdawarnings  ifu” in addition to these dynamic regulation data rules there can be more static regulation rules such as those predetermined for certain locales for example some drug sales are illegal in certain countries so there might be a rule like “rule when client requests landing page and geolocationclientwithinrestrictedstates  return “stop—you must dispose of this item because it is illegal for you to possess it in your current locale”another type of rule is a supply chain participant rule that reacts to supply chain participant data and a directive the nature of having each individually unique landing page for each product item react to supply chain participant data and a directive provided by a supply chain participant that applies to the product item is a muchneeded feature a supply chain participant could be a manufacturer wholesaler distributor pharmacy consumer etc the system would be set up so that each supply chain participant can add data to the individual drug packages collection of data when needed along with a directive which is essentially an actionable metadata about the supply chain participant data a major example of this is when a recall must be made on a particular batch  of drug x the supply chain participant data in this case would be a codification of “recall has been made for drug x batch ” and the directive would be “show directions for return” the first rule that picks up on this data would look like “rule when client requests landing page lp for drug x and there exists supply chain participant data for drug x that contains ‘recall’ return batch‘’  prependlp recall noticex lp” another rule would cover the directive to “show directions for return” which would look like “rule when a call to recallnotice  is made intercept the call and return directiveshowdirectionsforreturn  recall notice with return directionsx recallnoticex”another type of rule is a user role rule that reacts to a user role identified with a current user the current user is the person or thing that is interacting with a landing page and the user role is identified either by direct identification or by inference direct identification can be achieved through an authentication system such as a log in involving a username password email or other unique user verification data inference can be achieved by using the context of a landing page client such as geolocation or even just a volunteered user role type indicator if the client is presented with buttons that say “i am a surgeon” or “i am a patient” and clicks one of them a user role rule is more likely to be implemented as a static rule rather than a dynamic rule since the permissions for user roles of supply chain participants are generally static and since there would be fewer data addition events concerning user roles such user role blockage situations like when a patient posts data and does not want any supply chain participant to see it except the prescribing doctor can be implemented either as a user role rule or a supply chain participant rule an example of a static user role rule for a drug package would be “rule when client requests landing page lp and userroleclient doctor return enforcehipaadatablocklp” since in this case it is assumed that there will always be an hipaa data enforcement needed when the user role of the viewing user is anything but a doctor it may even be more specific and make a further check to see if the doctor is authorized to view the particular patientsubmitted supply chain participant data regarding the drug package in question the nature of having each individually unique landing page for each product item react to the user role identified for a scanning supply chain participant being an innovative way to categorize and limit certain supply chain participants from making certain actions with both the data and other supply chain participants is an important feature for the heavily regulated biomedical industrythe invocation of a landing page is made by any client presumably one of the supply chain participants through the unique url—the client in this case would be a “scanning supply chain participant” because to access the unique url they would most likely have scanned the qr code on the product item package using a smartphone or other cameraenabled device a computer system receives via the unique url a scan of the unique qr code by a scanning supply chain participant and then identifies the scanning supply chain participant with a user role if there is no way to infer or identify the scanning supply chain participants user role there is a default of him being the consumer or patient this is because the consumer is presumed to be the least likely to have an account on the system before he starts using it whereas industrial supply chain participants like the manufacturer wholesaler or distributor are much more likely to have an account on the system and be disciplined to be using their account as part of standard business practicefinally the regulation rule supply chain participant rule and user role rule are all combined to affect the response of the url invocation in the majority of cases it would affect the structure content and presentation of a web landing page response in some cases it may affect encoded responses such as json or xml representations of the same data that would have been viewed on a landing page—this would happen in the situation where the url was being used in an api mode multiple supply chain participants submit data to the same url each data of which affects the response of the subsequent url invocation these data are combined to produce a resultant response by means of the beforementioned rules the nature of the collaboration of multiple supply chain participants in contributing data via the unique url for each individual product item leads to a sociallyconstructed unique landing page as a result which represents a level of productive communication unheard of in the industry currently furthermore the communication is done at the granularity level of an itemlevel package which allows for much more interesting onetoone data collection the final useful result is an itemlevel unique landing page whose structure and content has been “crowdsourced” whereby the crowd is made up of supply chain participants that are part of the pedigree of product handling for the biomedical product item associated with the unique urlin one particular embodiment of applying the combined rules on a particular drug package—in this case a pill bottle with a unique qr printed on its label and also bearing printed regulation required data the consumerpatient enters supply chain participant data that is personal only to him for example he creates and submits an active calendar to help himself adhere to a schedule for prescription medication involving the drug package then using a segment of the landing page interface that allows him to create rules on his data he sets a user role rule to block the data from being viewed by any other supply chain participant other than him then he sets a supply chain participant rule that makes the landing page show him his calendar as the firstdisplayed widget on the landing page for the particular drug package he owns with a directive that shows “warning—you have missed x days of this medication” if there has been  consecutive days in which he has not marked “taken” on his active calendar the system applies a regulation rule that shows him the specific details of the drug he has below the active calendar on the landing page he then makes use of this landing page configuration to make sure he is taking medication on the schedule he is supposed to adhere to according to his primary care physician making it a habit to scan the unique qr code on the pill bottle every day finally when he runs out of pills and needs to refill the prescription he may use the same bottle to refill at the pharmacy or even get a new bottle with a new qr code and landing page which he initializes by populating it with active calendar data from the old pill bottle in another embodiment of this scenario the patient can opt to share his active calendar data with another supply chain participant perhaps having been incentivized to do so by a manufacturer since this data is highly valuable for a manufacturer and other parties to predict drug sales observe realtime drug usage among other benefitsone embodiment of the present invention is a collaborative method for tracking and tracing a biomedical product that also includes using the printer to print an instructions for use ifu document that is stored with the biomedical product item and contains a unique itemlevel qr code that leads to a unique web landing page that unique web landing page can be configured to always redirect to the most recent version of the ifu document in the case of a surgeon using the ifu on a medical device using a simple scan the surgeon would always be directed to the most updated version of the ifu which may contain updates from the manufacturer about best usage patterns safety concerns warnings or other relevant information for the surgeons task at hand finally this electronic ifu eifu document can be associated with a unique device identifier udi as mandated by the fda also serving as a way to track the usage and safety of a medical device at the item level an example of how this might be used for safety purposes is tracking whether and when the eifu has been accessed to ensure that the surgeon or his staff has read the necessary information to implement the unique landing page provides an indicator of whether the most recent electronic version of the ifu document has been previously accessed via said unique landing page even if an ifu document has already been read and marked as read the indicator will be reset when the manufacturer posts a new version of the ifu document the landing page can also provide a date and time stamp of when the most recent electronic version of the ifu document was previously accessed via the unique landing page as well as record new date and time stamps for future scansanother embodiment of the present invention involves a local regulation which causes the unique landing page to be reconfigured to comply with such local regulation first a supply chain participant writes supply chain participant data to the unique url that serves as an indicator of the local regulation an indicator of the local regulation is any information that infers the jurisdiction or locale from which the system can look up what rules apply an example is if the supply chain participant writes his geolocation which indicates that he is in angola and that the local rules of the country of angola apply to the unique landing page he accesses with his mobile device if for example it is illegal to sell use or even possess the drug package in the supply chain participants possession in angola that fact will be encoded as a local regulation which then causes the unique landing page response to be modified to show “warning—it is illegal to sell use or possess this product in angola dispose of this product immediately” along with various disclaimers of liability in this case when the supply chain participant data is a geolocation it is offered by the supply chain participant because of generally accepted and implemented privacy rules on mobile browsers that require an optin to share geolocation in order to comply those privacy ruleswhile the methods disclosed herein have been described and shown with reference to particular operations performed in a particular order it will be
