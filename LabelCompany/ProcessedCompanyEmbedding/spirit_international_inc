under net proceeds marketing and sales will largely be related to the hiring and payment of a human sales force under repayment of new world debt this is the amount to be paid on july   in the event that we generate no revenues and are unable to make the payments as required under our agreement with new world distillery the company may change how it allocates its proceeds in order to repay this debt in the case that the full amount of the offering is not raised the offering proceeds will not be utilized to repay any existing indebtedness including that owed to mr dadon we currently consider the foregoing project our priority and intend to use the proceeds from this offering for such projects clarified as to term use and disclosure added that fees increase with the offering size as it is anticipated that a greater size of raise will increase the corporations activities which will result in a greater number of transactions thus resulting in the need for additional disclosure and accounting the whisky industry has been merging and acquiring distillery assets and trademarked brand names since the beginning of the th century now only a handful of companies dominate whisky production and marketing we have many competitors some of which already are well known household brands such as jack daniels johnny walker glenfiddich macallan and many others the particular brand of malt whiskey that we are selling differs from our competitors because when making this whiskey it utilizes exsherry small barrels for the purpose of aging this whiskey with a unique flavor the distillery uses australian malt barley and premium quality production techniques they use a smaller boutique distillery that has its own unique special recipe which offers a quality premium taste their products worldclass malt rich whisky’s is offered in different size bottles that will be appealing to the premium whisky drinker company description spirit international inc was incorporated in

the product from a friend that lives in australia the product is being sold in australia mr dadon has started working already compiling list of wholesalers and distributors that he is cold calling to introduce the product to the plan at this time is that he is also interviewing sales people that he can hire on a commission bases so that he does not need to spend any additional funds at this time

distribution agreement with new world whisky distilleries pty ltd under which spirit has received the exclusive right for distribution in europe and the middle east new world whisky distilleries pty ltd has an ambition to be the leading australian premium whisky company building a consumer brand amongst spirit drinkers the global financial crisis has shifted wealth both with regards to who has it and how it is being spent however premium brands have continued to show strong growth with  growth rate anticipated for this year for a total of  billion that increase would mark the third straight year that luxurygoods sales have seen a growth rate of at in excess of   bain  co annual study october  the study also finds a generational shift under way as new and young consumers seek significantly different experiences from luxury consumption driving this growth is the developing middleupper class in emerging markets like asia south america eastern europe and india and whisky especially for premium branded whisky is capitalizing on this shift and the generational opportunity developing markets afford in the traditional western markets where whisky has been established longer the aging population and increasing discernment across all whisky segments is creating strong demand for premium whiskies even in the traditional wine cultures of southern europe younger consumers are being increasingly attracted to whisky as part of their modern whisky repertoire the new whisky drinker is proving more experimental and there is also a movement away from lighter blended whiskies evidenced by the recent growth of single malts premium bourbons and specialists offerings from the new micro whisky distilleries the growing opportunity in australia and worldwide for an outstanding malt whisky at an attractive price is a fundamental reason why this company was established australian wines are known and loved around the world for their taste quality and craftsmanship and we aim to leverage this reputation in our efforts to build this premium brand new world whisky distilleries pty ltd’s whisky is produced in melbourne which offers the perfect climate to produce the whisky the maturation period is shorter than traditional scotch whiskies – reducing inventory holding costs while maintaining its premium quality this is a significant strategic advantage of our business that we aim to leverage to maximum effect the distillery uses australian malted barley that is malted to specific requirements victorian water a bespoken hybrid yeast strain and copper pot stills manufactured in australia the spirit is matured in recoopered australian exsherry barrels the barrels are recoopered in australia into small casks l to accelerate maturation
