us news company investors contact  november  net medical xpress letter to shareholders  november   net medical xpress solutions inc otcqb symbol nmxs released the yearly letter to shareholders which follows in total letter to shareholders november  as we begin to wrap up  at net medical i wanted to provide everyone with some perspective on the state of affairs at the company a transition year we’ve been dealing with numerous technology and market disruptions our engineering team needed to replace outdated legacy software we worked to complete our telemedicine software which we announced last december we introduced the telemed building blocks to most of our current customers we outsourced our fda viewer for radiologists and other physicians who interpret plain films cts ultrasounds etc this effort is ongoing as we are adding yet another third party fda cleared viewer to offer our physicians more choices we are striving for future cost savings by moving our data storage to third party vendors the engineering team is adopting the amazon cloud to handle our cloud services and interact with our video conferencing products we have nearly completed this massive undertaking that required additional engineering efforts we completed the transition from our dfc digital filing cabinet to outsource our product to the box initially this resulted in revenue losses but the decision to retire a technology that was over  years old was the right choice in operations it takes about six months for an employee to develop the expertise to deal with the multitude of telemedicine issues we have added to our operations staff and created an office of program management a former employee returned in october to assist the team in preparing for an influx of new programs that will drive our growth during  the department works with engineering to develop and coordinate new customers and train operations staff in the complex world of telemedicine during the year as we opted out of older legacy customers we experienced a loss in our radiology business however in september we began to rebuild our customer network including a return of customers who had left because of lower commodity pricing we are adding an expert sales professional from the teleradiology industry who will join us after the first of the year we expect our radiology business to rebound during  serving rural hospitals with telemedicine services our specialists division which handles patient cases in rural hospitals is also picking up we’ve added several new customers and expect that to accelerate during  we forecast that we can double our business in neurology and neuro surgery cases as an example of the success one hospital reported to us that their october caseload rose to  cases from an average of    cases per month of the  cases  patients were admitted instead of being transferred and  were discharged home safely there were three neurosurgery consults and seven inpatient consults the good news is only two patients needed to be transferred which resulted in multiple benefits for the patient the patient’s family and the rural hospital the ceo of one rural hospital customer told us that prior to our telemedicine program as many as ten times the number of patients would have had to be transferred at great expense to the patient and insurance companies the cost of our service to the hospital was about  but the additional revenue for the hospital was about  million we’re getting this type of feedback from many of our rural hospitals our expertise is growing our neurology staff is also growing radiology staff has been reduced about  due to increased efficiencies among current staff other case studies including primary care our largest group of providers is our biggest area of growth and we expect that to continue in  in our staffing division we have brought our permanent database of physicians to nearly one million professionals we invested in a huge program of communications by both email and direct recruiting for both our customers and net medical we’ll see multiple programs in  including new insurance companies international customers and physicians who will be providing service for lgbt hiv and dermatology patients in one company alone we will be providing doctors for over  patients currently the division is in the process of recruiting an additional  physicians the staffing company which we purchased four years ago will be very busy during the coming year promising new initiatives net medical xpress has just collaborated with an emerging domestic and international telehealth and telemedicine company teleplus health care teleplus is a complete telehealth solution that addresses all the major health care issues net medical and teleplus have partnered with the top specialists in the country that specialize in chronic care diabetes primary care mental health substance abuse and follow up care all integrated on a single secure portable electronic medical record net medical xpress and teleplus health care have partnered with the largest hospital system in new jersey as well as three other world class universities both net medical xpress and teleplus are expected to be one of the largest telemedicine companies in china usa ireland and taiwan in the next year the program involves some six affiliated telemedicine companies net medical will provide recruiting services pharmacy prescription software quest care  lab software and video conferencing software for all services we plan to provide video conferencing equipment for all companies involved in the program in addition we will provide neurology cardiology endocrinology pulmonology and dermatology specialists for all states using the specialist portion of the program we are also in talks with a multinational company headquartered in australia that plan to integrate our video conferencing product for sale in asia australia new zealand and eventually the us healthy cash flow and the look ahead on the financial side we remain healthy with good cash flow while we suffered losses in  we are building and upgrading our products in anticipation of future revenue increases we have been financing these investments from internal cash flow which alleviates the need to go outside the company for financing no financing is planned although we have access to multiple lines of credit from two banking facilities we had to call on our malpractice insurance company twice this year first to assist with a suit in an alleged wrongful death at a hospital in  and secondly after a jailed illegal brought charges against one of our radiologists we expect both of these suits to be dismissed since the suits in our opinion have no merit however in a medical lawsuit nearly everyone involved in providing care for a patient is brought into a suit since we began offering telemedicine ten years ago we have had three lawsuits against us all of which have been dismissed still we are faced with a high deductible payment in our malpractice insurance that we carry to defend our company in the event of litigation while we have been making major investments in our infrastructure and staffing our goal is to return to profitability as quickly as possible some of the anticipated sales we previously forecast for this year have been delayed until  our sales goals depend on finding customers who fit our service capabilities net medical is now poised to bring on five major customers we’ve been in contract discussions with these customers for over seven months it takes a lengthy amount of time to transition out of total dependency on radiology medical services to our more profitable specialist programs those goals are now being realized net medical is not currently planning any acquisitions during the coming year however if opportunities present themselves we will certainly evaluate any merger activity our staff is looking forward to the coming year and the opportunities that it presents i greatly appreciate the support that so many of you have given us this was not an easy year by any means but our pipeline of new business has never

away from our legacy businesses in radiology and cardiology excellent gains in our specialists segment were boosted by our access grant with the university of new mexico as well as our ability to add new customers and new customers in our primary care segment “during the quarter we held down costs which enabled us to record another profitable quarter loss of customers in our legacy radiology and cardiology services segments due to industry consolidations offset gains in the neurological and primary care services of our specialists division and staffing services losses in our legacy radiological services reflected smaller customers using multiple providers to meet their budgets and larger customers running their own inhouse radiological programs new providers that have entered
