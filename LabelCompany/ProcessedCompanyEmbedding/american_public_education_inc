premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search american public education inc surely wishes more of the american public attended its schools new student enrollment continues its precipitous fall brian stoffel tmfcheesehead nov   at pm american public is hoping for more graduates to cross its stage image american public education forprofit schools have had a very rough five years as far back as  however i singled out american public education nasdaqapei as one of the few bright spots in an industry rife with misaligned incentives because the company focused on military students had lowerthanaverage default rates and offered classes for far less than other companies i believed that american public might actually make a good investment but even american public has stumbled on tough times with the stock having lost half of its value since last february based on earnings that the company released this week i dont see things improving any time soon american public education results just the numbers expected revenue actual revenue expected eps actual eps 7 million  million   sources etrade sec filings owners in american public stock might cheer the fact that earnings came in ahead of expectations even if there was a miss on revenue but its important to note that revenue was down  from the same time last year and earnings dropped even more  roughly  managements midpoint guidance for the fourth quarter is nongaap earnings of  per share on revenue of  million for comparison analysts are expecting the same level of earnings on  million what happened with american public this quarter no matter what however the big important numbers for american public still arent moving in the right direction net course registrations at the american public university system fell  from the same time last year overall student enrollment was down even more shrinking  year over year more critically net course registrations by new students  which really show the direction that the school is going  were down significantly at the american public university system they were down  an acceleration from earlier in the year the companys much smaller subsidiary the hondros school of nursing also reported that new student enrollment was down  what management had to say the precipitous drop in new student enrollment is what investors should be focused on in the companys previous conference call management signaled that it expected new student enrollments to fall between  and  looked at in this light you could actually argue that the quarter wasnt that disappointing in the earnings release management stated the decline in total net course registrations by new students was primarily the result of a  yearoveryear decline in net course registrations by new students who use federal student aid fsa as their primary funding source  management is stuck in a nowin situation for much of its existence american public relied on military tuition assistance for active personal and veterans affairs benefits to help students pay for tuition but a few years back they realized that they needed to diversify their income base and started trying to attract nonmilitary students these students often use fsa to help pay for school  so a  decline in net course registrations by new students who use fsa clearly signals that this effort isnt going as well as planned looking forward one might look at the companys nongaap guidance and think the stock should hold its ground given how close the forecast is to what analysts are hoping for but its important to note that gaap earnings are expected to come in much lower at a midpoint of  the difference is due to the companys having taken a hit for employee redeployment and the writedown of information technology assets  thats not great news either as it shows that management wasted money on it assets and is having a tough time allocating its workforce with smaller enrollment numbers   brian stoffel
