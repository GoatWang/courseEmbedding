laboratories corp bnkl overview home products overview products bionik’s suite of robotic rehabilitation products are the result of groundbreaking medical engineering research and development at the newman laboratory for biomechanics and human rehabilitation at the massachusetts institute of technology mit our systems have been tested by leading medical centers in dozens of controlled clinical trials including large randomized controlled clinical studies through our research we have discovered that the best way to optimize robot therapy is by allowing the robots to focus on reducing impairments and allowing the therapist to assist on translating the gains in impairment into function bionik’s modular systems approach to neurorehabilitation is the only system designed to optimize the use of robotics in a manner that is consistent with the latest clinical research and neuroscience taking into account the latest understanding on motor learning interference and motor memory consolidation clinical results in a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving  chronic stroke patients with moderate to severe upperlimb impairment our assistasneeded™ therapy demonstrated significant improvement in arm movement function and quality of life the study also found that “the improvements provide evidence of potential longterm benefits of rehabilitation and challenge the widely held clinical belief that gains in motor function are not possible for long term stroke survivors” in a controlled clinical study involving  stroke inpatients the motor skills of the robottreated group improved significantly more than the control group analysis showed that interactive robotic therapy significantly reduced motor impairment of the treated limbs doubling the impairment reduction a multicenter va study of  patients with longterm severe to moderate upperlimb impairment from a stroke that occurred at least  months before enrollment average time of  years  with multiple strokes found that “the improvements provide evidence of potential longterm benefits of rehabilitation and challenge the widely held clinical belief that gains in motor function are not possible for long term stroke survivors” technology our robotic products have exceptional capacity for measurement and immediate interactive response which sets them apart from other therapy systems senses the patient’s movement and responds to a patient’s continuallychanging ability robots guide the exercise treatment accordingly if the patient is unable to move the robot gently assists the patient to initiate movement towards the target if coordination is a problem the robot “guides” the movement allowing the patient to move towards the target and making certain that the patient is practicing the movement the correct way as the patient gains movement control the robot provides less assistance and continually challenges the patient provides quantifiable feedback on progress and

wistron corporation partner to develop exoskeleton technologies for consumer medical device market joint development project pairs expertise of both companies to produce lowprice lowerbody assistive robotic products for the consumer home market jun   am edt toronto and boston june   prnewswire  bionik laboratories corp otcqxbnkl bionik or the company a robotics company focused on providing rehabilitation and assistive technology solutions to individuals with neurological and mobility challenges from hospital to home today announced a joint development project the agreement with wistron corporation tpe wistron pursuant to the agreement the two companies will partner to design engineer and manufacture lowprice lowerbody assistive robotic technologies for mass commercial sale within the consumer home products market the companies plan to base the new consumer exoskeleton products off bioniks arke lower body exoskeleton currently in clinical development for use within rehabilitation environments as well as incorporating other important intellectual property relating to bioniks acquired or licensed assistive robotic technologies the companies intend to target the asian market initially where the agingelderly population is projected to hit  million by  increasing the need for affordable assistive technologies over the next half century wistron which designs and manufactures technology products for global distribution with annual revenue exceeding  billion will codevelop with bionik a consumer exoskeleton product which will be sold under the bionik brand name and at a price point so they can be more widely available to the mass consumer market wistron is a highly significant organization within the manufacturing industry so having an opportunity to combine our industryleading expertise within the robotics industry with their product development resources is incredible for us said peter bloch chief executive officer of bionik our years of experience in medical robotics has provided us with strong clinical data and technology to help us access this growing market of robotics technologies in the area of human assistance we intend to continue to seek out additional partnerships that will allow us to bring our technology to a mass audience within the consumer products sector the medical robotics market is projected to be worth b by  up from b in  according to a recent report this provides a significant opportunity for bionik to partner with larger manufacturers and provide technical expertise to develop products for distribution at larger scale within a high growth market the industry has seen a rise of robotics and smart technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning within the medical field but much of that innovation is within a clinical setting as such there exists a tremendous opportunity for disruption within the consumer space as bionik does not believe that there are currently options that are both viable and affordable wistron is one of the worlds largest original design manufacturers and has worked with some of the worlds largest companies to design and manufacture consumer technology products and bring them to market upon completion of the design of any new product conceived within the framework of the agreement wistron would be the sole manufacturer this partnership with wistron represents a tremendous opportunity for bionik to bring our technology to a massive consumer audience when it comes to the commercialization of consumer tech products – design engineering and manufacturing – wistron is a leader said michal prywata cofounder and coo of bionik our leading robotic technologies are already available in more than  facilities across the globe but this partnership with wistron will allow us to provide access to a much larger consumer market    about wistron wistron corporation tpe is a fortune global  company and a technology service provider
