usget in touchc marketing teacher ltd    all rights reserved company number  three levels of a product lessonexerciseanswerthree levels of a productconsumers often think that a product is simply the physical item that he or she buys in order to actively explore the nature of a product further let’s consider it as three different products – the core product the actual product and finally the augmented product this concept is known as the three levels of a productthree levels of a productthe core product is not the tangible physical product you can’t touch it that’s because the core product is the benefit of the product that makes it valuable to you so with the car example the benefit is convenience ie the ease at which you can go where you like when you want to another core benefit is speed since you can travel around relatively quicklythe actual product is the tangible physical product you can get some use out of it again with the car it is the vehicle that you test drive buy and then collect you can touch it the actual product is what the average person would think of under the generic banner of productthe augmented product is the nonphysical part of the product it usually consists of lots of added value for which you may or may not pay a premium so when you buy a car part of the augmented product would be the warranty the customer service support offered by the car’s manufacturer and any aftersales service the augmented product is an important way to tailor the core or actual product to the needs of an individual customer the features of augmented products can be converted in to benefits for individualsfeatures and benefits of productsfeatures and benefits of a product are also relevant to the three levels of the product products tend to have a whole series of features but only a small number of benefits to the actual consumerlet’s look at this another way if you buy a nintendo console it has many features for example you can play games alone or you can play against another opponent or two or three opponents you can also have access to the internet avatars are adaptable so you can create yourself and your friends these are all examples of features to the consumer however a consumer may buy it because he or she wants to stay fit and will use software and peripherals to become healthier becoming healthier is the benefit to the consumerthe consistent marketer will aim to discover the consumer’s preference for benefits and will match individual features to the preference that is why professional salespeople for example often ask many questions whereas a novice salesperson will just tell you the features of the productnew product development npdnew product development npd will take in to account the consumer’s preference for benefits over features by considering research into their needs npd aims to satisfy and anticipate needs npd delivers products which offer benefits at the core actual and augmented levelsnpd might offer a replacement product for a current line it could add products to the current line it could discover new product lines and sometimes it delivers very innovative products which the world might not have seen beforenew products are launched for all sorts of reasons as we know from our previous lesson on the business environment legislation ie changes in the law can mean that companies have to design and develop new products an example of this was when we moved from videotape recorders to digital and dvd recorders so products need to be modified for changing target marketssometimes the company will need to increase the volume that a production plant delivers since maybe it is not running at full capacity an example of this would be a food manufacturer of tinned soup that has a factory which can operate  designing different derivatives of the soup in order to lower the unit cost of production so product lines are extended in this case the reason being is to ease operational efficiencyintense competitive rivalry in the market will also lead to the need for npd just think about your smart phone and how quickly such products go through their product life cycles throughout your customer lifecyclechange in any element of the marketing mix would influence npd for example there is a movement to shop online and some products need to be distributed via online retailers and the product is adapted to make it compact and simple to deliver npd can be driven by many influences from changing consumer tastes to the need to adapt products and services for local or international marketanother marketing tool for evaluating product is the product life cycle plc also see the customer life cycle clcpublished by tim friesner marketing teacher designs and

characteristics authorkotler philip countryunited states period typemodel roleconsultant and manager activityanalyse and design topictechnology  operations and marketing  sales abstr levelenvironment perspectiverational statusfinal moduleclassics i comments   advertising   description in the s the economist philip kotler changed the perception of marketing he described what marketing is rather than what marketers do thereby changing marketing from a departmental specialisation into a corporate wide doctrine for kotler marketing was a social process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating and exchanging products and value with others for him a product is more than physical a product is anything that can be offered to a market for attention acquisition or use or something that can satisfy a need or want therefore a product can be a physical good a service a retail store a person an organisation a place or even an idea products are the means to an end wherein the end is the satisfaction of customer needs or wants kotler distinguished three componentsneed a lack of a basic requirement want a specific requirement for products or services to match a need demand a set of wants plus the desire and ability to pay for the exchange  customers will choose a product based on their perceived value of it satisfaction is the degree to which the actual use of a product matches the perceived value at the time of the purchase a customer is satisfied only if the actual value is the same or exceeds the perceived value kotler defined five levels to a product  core benefit the fundamental need or want that consumers satisfy by consuming the product or service  generic producta version of the product containing only those attributes or characteristics absolutely necessary for it to function  expected productthe set of attributes or characteristics that buyers normally expect and agree to when they purchase a product  augmented productinclusion of additional features benefits attributes or related services that serve to differentiate the product from its competitors  potential productall the augmentations and transformations a product might undergo in the future kotler noted that much competition takes place at the augmented product level rather than at the core benefit level or as levitt put it new competition is not between what companies produce in their factories but between what they add to their factory output in the form of packaging services advertising customer advice financing delivery arrangements warehousing and other things that people value kotlers model provides a tool to assess how the organisation and their customers view their relationship and which aspects create value assets five

and most basic form of marketing it requires no special analysis or psychology to be successful and is based only on announcing the presence of a supply to meet the existing demand this first level of marketing is used constantly by large and small businesses to sell product to existing market segments and to ensure that companies deliver what is clearly and consistently desired or needed by the public the challenge in such situations is often not to drive consumer demand but to gain an advantage over industry competitors with your price point features and advertising message or market presence looking for openings when marketers study a marketplace to find gaps between existing products they are engaging in the second level of marketing in such cases the demand for a new product or approach has not been established but significant room exists for a company to develop within the current framework for example lets say there are electricpowered sports cars on the market and electricpowered suvs the gap between these two products leaves the door open for a manufacturer who can offer an electricpowered sedan to jump in and create a new market segment this second level of marketing requires foresight and insight to manage and the flexibility of a company to meet the changing opportunities that may arise creating demand the third and most difficult level of marketing to find success with is one that requires the marketer to establish demand where none existed prior this third level of marketing is undertaken despite a lack of space or an established need it is the truest form of marketing and the level that requires the most skill and creativeness to manipulate the marketer is essentially convincing the consumer that her product is worth a purchase and that it necessary to a happy or safe lifestyle in some way for example if you build a new speed cooker you will have to show people what makes it better than the microwave in such a way as to convince the consumer to make the investment and the change from what theyre used to if companies can manage to transform their products from the new thing to the industry standard the potential for success is

product levels concept   augmented product concept three levels of a producttotal product concept introduction in the book principles of marketing philip kotler et al devised a very interesting concept of benefit building for products kotler suggested that if you view a product on three levels it will help you extract all the benefits that your product offers this strategy has various names including total product concept augmented product and three levels of a product the diagram below shows the three levels that make up the total product concept level one core product level one is the most basic level and simply looks at what people set out to buy and what benefits the producer would like their product to offer buyers for example a camera is expected to take pictures but there may be other benefits that the producer wants the buyer to enjoy such as a wide lens face recognition and high definition videos so prior to designing any product designers should list the core benefits the product needs to provide level  actual product level two is about translating the list of core product benefits into a product that people will buy there may be competitor products offering the same benefits so the aim at this stage is to design a product that will persuade people to purchase your product kotler states that this can involve deciding on the quality level product and service features styling branding and packaging for example apples iphone design has enabled it to become a smart phone market leader so that by september  it was able to launch the iphone  the th version of this product there are other smart phones on the market but apple has managed to design a product which people preorder and camp overnight outside apples retail stores so that they can be the first ones to buy the product level  augmented product level three involves deciding the additional non tangible benefits that a product can offer competition at this level is based around after sales service help lines warranties freecheap delivery and so on in other words it is things that the product does not do but customers may find them useful non tangible benefits such as product warranties offer customers peace of mind and demonstrate the manufacturer has faith in the quality of its product in fact the ubiquitous use of some augmented benefits have turn some level three benefits into a customer expectation for example customers expect cars to have manufacturer warranties   studying business management visit wwwlearnmanagementcom home  about learnmarketing  useful marketing links

value of test marketing are often murky issues the problem is partly that new products aren’t developed and put through their paces in a systematic enough way to let marketing men know when a test market is really in order compounding this difficulty is that the goals of test marketing are sometimes unclear and that the information once gathered is often improperly used this article is an attempt to lay bare the bones of the issue beginning with an overview of sound new product development it clarifies when a test market should be done what its aims should be and to what uses it should be put relying for many of their judgments on quoted firstperson interview material with marketing executives the authors finish with a postscript on how technological innovation can aid in test marketing the executive must weigh a myriad of information as he decides whether to go with a new product to help him in his decision he may consider test marketing to gather yet more information for the executive contemplating test marketing we intend to focus first on three strategic questions when should you conduct a test market what can you learn from a test market how should you use information from a test market we will then explore recent developments in new product research—specifically the use of simulation models and test markets in the laboratory environment the questions and answers that follow reflect test marketing experiences we gathered from  marketing research executives who had been involved in hundreds of new product introductions see the sidebar “commentators” for the list of interviewees these products included packaged grocery items healthcare products and consumer durables the executives represent three orientations toward test markets—the manufacturer

president research systems inc evansville indiana william weilbacher vice chairman dancer fitzgerald sample inc new york whether to test market is a compromise between collecting more information at considerable direct and indirect cost to reduce uncertainty and introducing the product immediately to make money as posner points out “every month in test means giving up sales if the product turns out to be successful” the direct costs of test marketing include a pilot plant to make the product commercials an advertising agency because media are not billed pointofsale material produced in small quantities higher media expenses because of low volumes couponing sampling and higher trade allowances to obtain distribution for example the cost for a typical twocity test market in  was  four tests were required to test two levels of ad weight this meant a market testing cost of  but there are also indirect costs there is for example the cost of revealing a new product idea to a competitor if he is better organized for new product introductions he can beat you to the market it is hard to estimate the cost of being second in the market but marketing experience indicates that it means a lower market share and higher promotional costs another indirect cost is that of exposure “if you are promoting a family brand you are exposing the name of your company as well as the brand” claycamp reminds “if you get a reputation for bombing you may have trouble getting distribution the next time or in enlisting the enthusiasm of the sales force” observes kuehn it is impossible to estimate these exposure costs diversion of employee time and activities is an internal outofpocket expense that is rarely quantified when the cost of test markets is estimated “the internal costs for test marketing are incredible they divert management attention and manpower from other activities” mcmennamin warns adds newman “sales management objects to too many test markets because they take away from sales activities” these high direct and indirect costs of test marketing provide a strong incentive for postponing the decision to test market until the marketing executive feels confident he has the three basic elements of the ideal product development plan secure a successful product a competitive marketing strategy and a superior communication plan many researchers feel that test marketing should be the last check before rolling the product out into national distribution “i would say the batting average ought to be somewhere between  and ” pearson calculates light maintains that “when you go into test market you’ve made the decision to go the test market can of course alter your plans by giving you a nogo but in the absence of bad results you continue” the rising costs of test markets have led researchers to use less expensive methods to kill a product or advertising campaign early in the process of new product development “you certainly don’t want to use a test market to learn something that you could have learned earlier—test marketing is much too expensive” longman insists implicit in the comments of our marketing executives is a wellarticulated new product development process it is to this process that the executives tacitly appeal when they make their judgments on the costs of test marketing a conceptualization of this process appears in the exhibit “an idealized process for new product development” here we can see how a product and a communication plan should be refined before test marketing exhibit an idealized process for new product development when should you conduct a test market the first step in the new product sequence is an identification of opportunities—needs not being met adequately by products that are currently available this phase of research frequently uses qualitative techniques borrowed from social psychology one method often used is the focusgroup or groupdepth interview this is a twohour discussion in which  to  persons are asked to describe their experiences with present products or to recount how they handle specific problems for example a pharmaceutical company may ask a group of young mothers how they treat a child’s cold mothers’ perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of available products will come to light during these discussions such interviews provide concepts for new products or for extension of present products these concepts are actually hypotheses that can then be tested with more quantitative methods such as the survey elimination of all but a few of the concepts is naturally a subjective process it may be based on the experience of marketing executives the politics of the company or the executives’ definition of their business and its capacity capacity should be defined to include not only production and financial capabilities but also executives’ ability to operate in the industry of the proposed product the number of product concepts finally chosen depends on the resources of the company and its strategy for new products given limited resources should a company select only one or two concepts and spend most of its resources on developing communication plans or should it retain four or five product concepts and test only a few communication plans for each one the answer to this question must reflect the history and strengths of the organization if most of its resources are in product rd it will probably experiment more with concepts than if its strength is in marketing and communications the next step in our ideal new product development is creating a preliminary profit plan that estimates the length of the payout based largely on estimates by experienced marketing executives this profit plan can eliminate product candidates that do not reach the minimum payout period set by management each stage in the exhibit replaces management estimates with data thereby reducing the range of uncertainty in estimating the profit plan the center section of the exhibit has three columns—product development strategy development and communication development these columns emphasize a very important point the steps contained in them are taken simultaneously not serially advertising development for example does not wait until a product is refined before starting its work but begins immediately on the problem of communicating the concept reflected in the item anticipated availability of a product in part determines the methods for its testing for instance a minimum of facilities may be required to produce actual products for testing a product extension such as the addition of a lemon flavor to an existing brand in contrast a new home entertainment center requires a whole new production facility in this latter case the concept is pretested in the first stage of product testing and the product in the second stage see the exhibit at the conclusion of these concept and product tests the profit plan can then be revised to take into account information derived from the research these new data suggest levels of production costs and therefore of product acceptability if a proposed product meets the minimum payout period it can then go into extended product use tests marketing strategy requires setting goals pricing strategies and distribution strategies for a new product rough estimates of price ranges may be part of product testing if your company plans to use its present channels of distribution the channel strategy may be that of determining how to get your channel to accept the new product if the strategy includes the development of a new channel—such as was required by the successful hanes strategy of distributing “l’eggs” hosiery through supermarkets—considerable work may be needed to estimate the costs of such a tactic communication strategy includes the development of the package the copy theme for advertisements and the selection of the desired media mix it is important to note that the communication plan feeds into the development of the marketing mix plans for strategy development the estimated cost of the communication plan is input for the final estimated profit plan the plan is then submitted to management for approval in order to proceed to the test market stage when then should a test market be done the experience of our experts suggests strongly that as saint says “you go into test market under the assumption that you have a successful product” what can you learn but when product and communications research have already told you that you have a successful product and communication plan why should you go to the expense of test marketing adding to the costs of delayed revenues from a successful item our survey indicates that the primary purpose of a test market is to provide as newman puts it a “good dress rehearsal for testing all of the product elements together not individually” before the test market the product and the communication plan have been tested separately the test market combines both these elements furthermore it tests the elements of the plan and their combinations in the real world it is posner says a “microcosm of what you will be doing and what will happen nationally” a realworld test of the marketing plan will provide estimates of marketing plan productivity suggestions for improving the plan’s productivity and a disaster check productivity of the marketing plan the test market provides measures of consumers’ responses to those elements that have been pretested—the product the price and the communication plan it also measures the trade’s acceptance of the product the strategy and the communication plan in most cases the company can rely on its experience with the trade to estimate future acceptance consumer response by measuring levels of consumer awareness product trial repeat purchase market share and sales volume the test market gives some indication of the productivity of the elements of the marketing plan these measures are the basis for making the “gonogo” decision such a decision can be made on the basis of ruleofthumb—for example drop the product if the trial rate is less than  the decision is then a financial one the data from the test markets having been inputs into the profit plan test markets provide better estimates of consumer response than any pretesting but as claycamp emphasizes “about all you can expect from a test market is the answers to the questions that you are asking of it in other words one has to be very specific about what one wants from a test market for this reason they really are designed only for gonogo decisions” pearson agrees “test marketing can tell you if you have a loser a medium success or a giant success it cannot finetune a payout plan between a two share and a three share” however ossip asserts that “we find test markets useful in telling us whether we will make our minimum” lavidge sees two reasons for a test market “one reason to test market is to decide how much of the product is likely to sell so that you can decide whether to go national the other reason to test market is to determine how to market the product” trade response “how to market” includes the question of trade acceptance—which in many cases has not been tested in the process of new product development saint describes the problem “suppose chesebrough came out with an entirely new product in an unfamiliar product category the chesebrough sales force and chesebrough as a company have built a fine reputation in the health and beautyaid field but in this case you would be taking the chesebrough salesman and putting him in a new buyer’s office the soap buyer wouldn’t know the salesman so you would want to see the capacity of your sales force to sell an unfamiliar product to unfamiliar buyers” thus acceptance of a new product is greatly dependent on experience and a successful track record experience in the product category enables the researcher to make reliable estimates of trade acceptance “if you don’t know what kind of distribution your sales force is capable of getting either you don’t know much about your sales people or else they are very unreliable” pearson contends experienced researchers estimate that the effect of the extra emphasis given by the sales force in the test market gains a  to  higher sales level than would be achieved after having gone national with the product eggert affirms this “in a test you get more emphasis since the sales manager visits the place two or three times and just the sheer fact that he visits adds impetus to a product” being first with a new product is extremely important in the groceryproduct category where limited shelf space in a store constrains distribution when gillette successfully introduced “the dry look” a hair spray for men several other companies tried to cash in on the success by introducing hair sprays of their own since hair sprays came in much larger containers than most hair preparations for men more shelf space was required to stock the same number of competing brands and because retailers tend to devote a fixed amount of shelf space to a particular product category many of the companies with metoo products had difficulty getting trade acceptance for copied items when measuring trade acceptance is not a problem as is often the case a marketer may use a controlled store test which greatly reduces the time required to run a test market a successful test market can improve the sales force’s ability to obtain distribution during national introduction a resounding success in say albany is often useful to the salesman seeking trade acceptance in st louis the salesman is equipped with real market results not inhouse test results or the results of a survey the only question is whether the results in albany are applicable to the situation in st louis how to improve marketing productivity as we discussed earlier you should run a test market only after extensive pretesting has shown that your new product will be a winner and even though it is useful to get better estimates of consumer and trade acceptance some marketers design their test markets to provide these better estimates and to provide information that will enable them to improve the productivity of the plan as schucker says “before test marketing you are convinced at least that the business is there so the question becomes one of how high you can go how much leverage through your marketing variables you can apply to the business to make it bigger” and von gonten agrees “i don’t want to go to test market with anything that i don’t know will be a success and i will use the test market to derive a means to make my product an even bigger success” to use the test market to improve the productivity of the marketing plan requires a research design that tests variations in the plan “there is more to be learned from test marketing than an estimate of trial and repeat there are the effects of sampling to be learned there are also the effects of varying levels of promotion to be learned” newman explains we conducted an informal survey of  marketing research executives attending a seminar on test marketing at the university of north carolina at chapel hill to learn how they recommend using test markets these are the results saint’s experience with “vaseline intensive care” hand lotion illustrates how test markets can improve the productivity of the marketing mix “we tested in three markets in two of the markets we went with straight advertising and in the third market we used a combination of advertising and sampling the success we found in that third market led us to a national program which used a combination of sampling and advertising” however research designs can be complicated when you are testing several variables in the marketing mix for example the famous dupont test of advertising for cookware coated with “teflon” used  cities to measure the direct and cumulative effects of three levels of television advertising as the number of elements or levels to be tested increases the number of cities and therefore the costs of test marketing increase newman feels that “ideally you should have a minimum of four cities on each variable” while schucker asserts that “you need at least two markets per variable” included in these increased costs are the expense of getting distribution in an increased number of cities across the country similar problems arise in purchasing advertising marketers who want to use test marketing to test several elements in the marketing mix may want to consider an approach used by michael von gonten this approach uses a single large city as the test site and treats neighborhoods as separate markets the logistical problems associated with multiplecity tests are therefore greatly reduced a singlecity test may involve only one sales district shipping and warehousing costs are thus reduced media purchases are simplified another feature of this design is a competitive one testing in a single city reduces exposure to competitors and may make it difficult for them to know the nature of the test variables under the control of the marketer—such as sampling couponing and instore variations—may work better in this design than media tests because few print and electronic media have split runs within cities it is naturally possible to design a test that is too complex as fountaine says “the further you get from reality the more likely you are to make an error” pearson avers “you better not do too many different things in test market because if you do you are going to confound your purposes” how to avoid disaster murphy’s law is familiar to most businessmen “if anything can go wrong it will” this law is particularly descriptive of the new product development process disasters are common in the development and introduction of new products and test markets are one of the ways to avoid as many disasters as possible the following is a partial list of the variety of things that have gone wrong in the development of a new product because packages would not stack the scouring pads fell off the shelf a dog food discolored on the store shelves in cold weather baby food separated into a clear liquid and a sludge in hot weather cigarettes in a new package dried out a pet food gave the test animals diarrhea when it was combined with a price reduction a product change in a liquid detergent was thought by consumers to be dilution with water because of insufficient glue over half of the packages came apart during transit excessive settling in a box of paper tissues caused the box to be onethird empty at purchase a large proportion of samples was not delivered until long after the test it is difficult however to justify a test market solely as a disaster check as pearson points out “some people put a lot of emphasis on the fact that a test market is a dry run my feeling is that it is an awfully expensive dry run” how should you use test data test marketing’s role is the evaluation of marketing plans many researchers caution against two major misuses  evaluation not generation or development test marketing is the last step in a process whose goal is a successful product the “ideal” process begins with the generation of new product ideas and ends with the evaluation of a complete marketing plan the beginning of this process as we showed in the exhibit is designed to generate many ideas with a minimum of evaluation these ideas are then subjected to a series of screenings using criteria established by corporate policy for instance the first screen in the exhibit is a financial one—a rough profit plan that compares the estimated payout period with the maximum period allowed by corporate policy concepts that pass through this screen receive further evaluation as they pass through successive screens during product and communication development a concept that fails to pass through a screen may be killed or it may be reevaluated and revised the outputs of the product and communication developments should be combined with the marketing strategy to form a complete marketing plan from this point the process should be concerned with the evaluation of the plan and some finetuning not with generation or development if idea generation and concept development appear at the test market stage these reflect an unwillingness on the part of management to kill products earlier a low “kill ratio” early in the screening process indicates that criteria are not stringent enough or that management is overriding them gibson warns “test marketing is a big expensive thing if your process lets everything get through to test market you are by definition not going to work on many ideas and you are not going to have many successes unless you just happen to have blind dumb luck you have to have a process that permits lots of ideas at the beginning that gradually get weeded out” the process for product development is not a mechanical one it is open to inputs from executives with creative spirit and a creative suggestion may of course override a criterion that has been established for a new product policy it is important to remember however that what is needed first is according to pearson a policy that clearly says “no concept that scores below a certain level will proceed to the next step just because you have such a policy naturally doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t sometimes bypass it but at least you should spell out the general rules so you know what you’re bypassing “we should articulate a policy that says ‘well sure it is all right to bypass the system but let’s be sure everybody knows what the rules are and accepts the fact that we have made a change because somebody has a great insight a great solution to a great marketing need we are going to go full steam ahead to test market or even national markets’ you then preserve your flexibility but at the same time you don’t let it confuse your system if most of your ideas go through a systematic process of development and evaluation then at least you know that you have the odds working for you” why are criteria overridden the answers seem to be related to differences in reward systems for researchers and product managers  evaluation of plans not people product managers tend to say “go” if a product concept does not look bad researchers want to say “stop” unless it looks good this difference in philosophy is the result of differences in evaluating product managers and researchers product managers succeed by having successful products researchers are expected to prevent costly failures mcmennamin observes that “because of the pressure to get something into test market it’s amazing how unconcerned product managers can be going into one but when negative results start coming in they get very detailed in their explanations of what’s happening” these differences in philosophy come into conflict in the new product development process during the establishment of criteria for evaluation researchers would like higher levels for earlier kill product managers would like lower levels so that a larger number of products could reach test market the marketing executive must reconcile these differences by establishing screening criteria consistent with corporate objectives resources and opportunities in addition to establishing these criteria marketing executives must establish the policies for overriding them researchers agree with the need to override criteria but they argue that an override should be noted as an exception to the system this notation protects the researcher from unfair criticism without constraining the product manager’s creative spirit in conjunction with other information to reiterate a point made earlier “test marketing” says levine “should not be used for trying to obtain salespoint estimates in a national market” posner concurs “management has regarded test marketing results as point estimates and has not accepted their imprecision the results should be considered in economicrisk terms” “researchers bring management information which is at best qualitative management puts it with information it already has and then makes a decision” concludes dunn management like navigators should use more than one source of information when sailing in dangerous waters the reality and integrative nature of a test market make it more credible to the executive than any other test procedure this partially explains why executives focus primarily on test market results without integrating other data a second reason for relying only on test markets is that it is difficult to assimilate the variety of information and judgments available to the marketing executive but recently developed simulation models can help the marketing executive in combining information to make new product decisions recent developments the high costs of test marketing—indirect and direct—provide an incentive for developing methods that circumvent this procedure laboratory and mathematical simulation models are two developments laboratory simulation in this procedure a sample of consumers is exposed to test commercials and then allowed to shop in a simulated supermarket environment demographic economic and brand preference data can be obtained prior to the test followup interviews after home use measure product satisfaction and intentions to repurchase these data can then be fed into mathematical models that predict market share there are three possible alternatives after the laboratory simulation first the product may be killed outright second favorable laboratory simulation results may encourage the marketer to go directly to a regional rollout third the laboratory simulation may be followed by a test market to measure the productivity of the marketing plan including trade acceptance to finetune the plan and to serve as a disaster check mathematical market simulation marketing researchers have established relationships among promotional expenditures awareness trial and repeat purchase that are used in mathematical simulations to predict market share market share predictions become inputs to the profit plan that estimates the payout period simulation models are used first to develop an initial payout estimate at this stage in the process the inputs to the model are executive judgments producttest data replace executive judgment in the next estimate of the payout period the estimate can then be revised again by using the simulation model with data from the extended productuse test and communication tests mathematical simulations complement test marketing in a variety of ways “they force people to consider the variables with which they are dealing before they go into test market” says mcmennamin models can be used to project test market results so that tests can be stopped sooner and they can be used for diagnostics after a test market is completed final note the decision to test market should be made only after the executive has received a complete marketing plan based on comprehensive product and communication tests test markets should be conducted to learn about the productivity of the marketing plan in terms of both consumer and trade response to learn ways to improve the productivity of the plan and to avoid potential disasters the results of the test market should be used to evaluate the marketing plan not to generate additional ideas and not for the evaluation of people executives play a major role in the new product development process by establishing levels of criteria for evaluation and policies for overriding these levels these levels and policies are part of the mechanism by which executives control the new product development process  james c becknell jr and robert w mcisaac “test marketing

marketing frequently differs from product management in hightech companies whereas the product manager is required to take a products requirements from the sales and marketing personnel and create a

tasks like giving product demonstrations in trade shows creating marketing collateral like hotsheets beatsheets cheat sheets data sheets and white papers this requires the product marketing manager to be skilled not only in competitor analysis market research and technical writing but also in more business oriented activities like conducting roi and npv analyses on technology investments

that they are chartered with developing much of the content for the various constituents sales marcom customers blogs etc creating content tends to be given more value than the actual research and thinking that is behind all the content in smaller hightech firms or startups product marketing and product management functions can be blurred and both tasks may be borne by one individual however as
