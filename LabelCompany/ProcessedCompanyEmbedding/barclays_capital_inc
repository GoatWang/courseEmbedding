internet subscription stock news service theflyonthewallcom for hotnews misappropriation under state common law doctrine could not stand as they were preempted by several sections of the federal copyright act  usc §   usc §  and  usc §  the case was significant because the second circuit redefined elements of the hotnews misappropriation tort breaking with earlier second circuit precedent by

story of the caseedit the defendant theflyonthewallcom inc was a company that was in the business of obtaining by various means daily stock recommendations prepared by the plaintiffs lehman brothers later purchased by barclays investment bank morgan stanley and merrill lynch in their highly soughtafter research reports the defendant sold a service wherein subscribers could receive these recommendations prior to their release by the plaintiffs to the general public the plaintiffs claimed that the value of the reports to their own clients was predicated on the reports exclusivity accuracy and timely release they were often only valuable during the few hours before the stock market would open and whose value to the firms in turn was predicated on their potential to attract and retain clients to entice clients to execute stock trades through them and to differentiate themselves from other financial services firms and for generating revenue by way of commissions earned from facilitating trades on behalf of those clients on june   the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against theflyonthewallcom ordering them to cease distributing portions of the exclusive research reports as well as the recommendations within them the plaintiffs sought to base their request for injunctive relief on two sets of legal claims  claims that the defendant had violated their copyright in the research reports by verbatim copying and dissemination of portions of the reports and  claims that the defendant had committed the commonlaw tort of hotnews misappropriation by publishing the recommendations within the reports in the procedural leadup to the trial the defendants essentially conceded their liability under the copyright claim thus at a bench trial before the district court for the southern district of new york the remaining issues to be tried were the appropriate relief for the copyright claim as well as liability and relief for the hotnews misappropriation claim on march   the district court found in favour of the plaintiffs issuing an injunction ordering the defendants to cease their publication of the plaintiffs reports and recommendations see summary of the courts decision below shortly thereafter the defendants appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit the defendants abandoned their defence against the copyright claims and focused solely on the hotnews misappropriation findings they argued that the district court had erred in finding that the hotnews misappropriation claim had been established that the claim made under state law was preempted and therefore barred by federal copyright legislation and that the resulting injunction was improperly granted was overbroad and violated the defendants free speech rights under the first amendment on june   the second circuit released its decision  reversing the decision of the district court below and instructing it to dismiss the claim a summary of the second circuits decision can also be found below opinion of the district courtedit hot news misappropriationedit hotnews misappropriation as a cause of action originated from international news service v associated press wherein the supreme court held that hot news defined as timesensitive information is protectable as quasiproperty this misappropriation doctrine was developed further with the aim to protect costly efforts to gather commercially valuable timesensitive information that would otherwise be unprotected by law significantly the hot news doctrine is concerned with the copying and publication of information gathered by another before he has been able to utilize his competitive edge  given that the copyright act of  deals specifically with copyright misappropriation for original works different judges holdings questioned the tort of hotnews misappropriation as a cause of action these discussions included copyright protection as only belonging to the realm of originality and not effort as well as holdings that the creative organization of information was copyrightable but not the information itself seventynine years later national basketball association v motorola inc nba provided answers to the questions that preceded it and also provided a fiveelement test for determining hotnews misappropriation test for determining hotnews misappropriationedit in barclays capital inc v theflyonthewallcom inc the court used the fiveelement test set out in nba which was cited in the district courts opinion as follows  a plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost  the information is timesensitive  a defendants use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiffs efforts  the defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs  the ability of other parties to freeride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened  district court ruling on firms hotnews misappropriation claimedit element edit the plaintiffs satisfied the first element of the hotnews misappropriation test because the plaintiffs spent hundreds of millions of dollars annually towards the production of equity research reports including the employment of highly skilled analysts the defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs engaged in costly information gathering element edit the plaintiffs reports and recommendations were held to be clearly timesensitive by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs clients used the information for their actions in anticipation of stock price movement moreover the timesensitivity was especially important as the plaintiffs expended resources to be the first to communicate these findings to the client and generate commissions revenue the defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs reports and recommendations were timesensitive element edit for the third element concerning freeriding the court found that the defendants core business was its freeriding off the sustained costly efforts by the firms and other investment institutions to generate equity research that is highly valued by investors the court defined freeriding as where there is very little investment by the defendant to profit off of information generated or collected by the plaintiff at great cost whereas the defendant did not on its own generate original research for the recommendations it published and its ability to profit off of the reproductions of the recommendations relied on both the plaintiffs reputations as well as the plaintiffs expenditure of resources toward generating expert analysis the court found that defendant freerode off of the plaintiffs work element edit the court found that the parties were in direct competition in that both were attempting to provide timesensitive information to clientele and the defendants dissemination of that information prior to the plaintiffs being able to satisfy the demand for premarket hours stock movement reports and trade recommendations in doing so the plaintiffs clientele already identified as more likely to trade through the source from which they ascertained the news were less likely to do their trading through the plaintiffs additionally the court noted that the defendant and the plaintiffs both used similar channels of information distribution including accesscontrolled media license thirdparty distributors to disseminate their information to entitled recipients element edit the court found that this element required the demonstration that the defendants conduct and others like the defendant if allowed to continue would be likely substantially to threaten plaintiffs ability to continue to participate in the market the court noted that the plaintiffs relied on being the first to report their reports and recommendations to their clients as such if other organizations were to preempt the plaintiffs the knowledge that the plaintiffs had spent money to gather and analyze would be rendered basic thus the court argued that if the defendant and others like it were allowed to continue copying and disseminating the research reports of the plaintiffs they would lose their commission revenue and not be able to offset the cost of producing the research and discontinue their research production district court ruling on firms copyright claim and resulting remedyedit the court found that the defendant had infringed the copyrights of two of the plaintiffs  morgan stanley and barclays capital to satisfy these requirements morgan stanley provided eight research reports and barclays capital provided nine research reports a total of seventeen research reports their associated registration certificates and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendants direct verbatim copying of key excerpts while throughout the pretrial process fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under  usc §  at trial the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports as such the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages prejudgment interest on the statutory damage awards and attorneys fees the court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports generated by those two plaintiffs opinion of the second circuit court of appealedit the defendant appealed the rulings of the district court on hotnews misappropriation to the court of appeals for the second circuit on appeal the second circuit court reversed the decision below and ruled in favor of the defendant finding that the plaintiffs hotnews misappropriation claim was preempted by federal copyright law federal preemptionedit the court recalled that in order to determine whether a statelaw claim is preempted by the federal copyright act  usc §  sets forth a two part test the general scope requirement if the impugned statelaw claim seeks to vindicate legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under  usc §  and the subject matter requirement if the work in question is of the type of works protected by the copyright act under  usc §  and  usc §  the second circuit found that the plaintiffs recommendations satisfied the subject matter requirement as well as the general scope requirement of the copyright act they held that the hotnews misappropriation exemption from preemption carved out in the nba case was explicitly intended to be narrow in scope in addition they characterized the part test that was set out in nba and applied by the district court as obiter dictum judge raggi in a separate concurring opinion disagreed with the majority that the nba test was dictum and would have held that although preemption occurred the part test was valid but had been misapplied in the court below organizations concerned about the second circuits rulingedit the case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors the electronic frontier foundation citizen media law project and public citizen inc filed an amicus curiae brief urging the second circuit court to take into consideration the first amendment as it related to the district court judgements potential restraints on americans abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day google and twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hotnews misappropriation tort the second circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the courts power and not relevant to the case the newspaper association of america the new york times company philadelphia media holdings stephens media time and the washington post filed an amicus brief the securities industry and financial markets association dow jones  company and the investorside research association each filed amicus briefs second circuits humorous footnotesedit ironyedit in recounting the story of the case the second circuit court wrote that they find little to take issue with in the district courts careful findings of facts to which we must in any event defer we therefore borrow freely from them these sentences are followed by a footnote which reads the irony of doing so in the context of a copyrightinfringement and hot newsmisappropriation case is not lost on us footnote  biblical referencesedit the second circuit court comments on the district courts characterization of the defendants behavior as having a biblical tone where the district court asserts that the defendant had reaped where it had not sown this claim is then footnoted by the second circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the bible in the bible that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise see eg galatians  god is not mocked for whatever a man sows that he will also reap but cf leviticus  setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown referencesedit  barclays capital inc v theflyonthewallcom inc  fsuppd  dist court sdny march    a b barclays capital inc v

june   the second circuit released its decision  reversing the decision of the district court below and instructing it to dismiss the claim a summary of the second circuits decision can also be found below opinion of the district courtedit hot news misappropriationedit hotnews misappropriation as a cause of action originated from international news service v associated press wherein the supreme court held that hot news defined as timesensitive information is protectable as quasiproperty this misappropriation doctrine was developed further with the aim to protect costly efforts to gather commercially valuable timesensitive information that would otherwise be unprotected by law significantly the hot news doctrine is concerned with the copying and publication of information gathered by another before he has been able to utilize his competitive edge  given that the copyright act of  deals specifically with copyright misappropriation for original works different judges holdings questioned the tort of hotnews misappropriation as a cause of action these discussions included copyright protection as only belonging to the realm of originality and not effort as well as holdings that the creative organization of information was copyrightable but not the information itself seventynine years later national basketball association v motorola inc nba provided answers to the questions that preceded it and also provided a fiveelement test for determining hotnews misappropriation test for determining hotnews misappropriationedit in barclays capital inc v theflyonthewallcom inc the court used the fiveelement test set out in nba which was cited in the district courts opinion as follows  a plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost  the information is timesensitive  a defendants use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiffs efforts  the defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs  the ability of other parties to freeride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened  district court ruling on firms hotnews misappropriation claimedit element edit the plaintiffs satisfied the first element of the hotnews misappropriation test because the plaintiffs spent hundreds of millions of dollars annually towards the production of equity research reports including the employment of highly skilled analysts the defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs engaged in costly information gathering element edit the plaintiffs reports and recommendations were held to be clearly timesensitive by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs clients used the information for their actions in anticipation of stock price movement moreover the timesensitivity was especially important as the plaintiffs expended resources to be the first to communicate these findings to the client and generate commissions revenue the defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs reports and recommendations were timesensitive element edit for the third element concerning freeriding the court found that the defendants core business was its freeriding off the sustained costly efforts by the firms and other investment institutions to generate equity research that is highly valued by investors the court defined freeriding as where there is very little investment by the defendant to profit off of information generated or collected by the plaintiff at great cost whereas the defendant did not on its own generate original research for the recommendations it published and its ability to profit off of the reproductions of the recommendations relied on both the plaintiffs reputations as well as the plaintiffs expenditure of resources toward generating expert analysis the court found that defendant freerode off of the plaintiffs work element edit the court found that the parties were in direct competition in that both were attempting to provide timesensitive information to clientele and the defendants dissemination of that information prior to the plaintiffs being able to satisfy the demand for premarket hours stock movement reports and trade recommendations in doing so the plaintiffs clientele already identified as more likely to trade through the source from which they ascertained the news were less likely to do their trading through the plaintiffs additionally the court noted that the defendant and the plaintiffs both used similar channels of information distribution including accesscontrolled media license thirdparty distributors to disseminate their information to entitled recipients element edit the court found that this element required the demonstration that the defendants conduct and others like the defendant if allowed to continue would be likely substantially to threaten plaintiffs ability to continue to participate in the market the court noted that the plaintiffs relied on being the first to report their reports and recommendations to their clients as such if other organizations were to preempt the plaintiffs the knowledge that the plaintiffs had spent money to gather and analyze would be rendered basic thus the court argued that if the defendant and others like it were allowed to continue copying and disseminating the research reports of the plaintiffs they would lose their commission revenue and not be able to offset the cost of producing the research and discontinue their research production district court ruling on firms copyright claim and resulting remedyedit the court found that the defendant had infringed the copyrights of two of the plaintiffs  morgan stanley and barclays capital to satisfy these requirements morgan stanley provided eight research reports and barclays capital provided nine research reports a total of seventeen research reports their associated registration certificates and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendants direct verbatim copying of key excerpts while throughout the pretrial process fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under  usc §  at trial the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports as such the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages prejudgment interest on the statutory damage awards and attorneys fees the court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports generated by those two plaintiffs opinion of the second circuit court of appealedit the defendant appealed the rulings of the district court on hotnews misappropriation to the court of appeals for the second circuit on appeal the second circuit court reversed the decision below and ruled in favor of the defendant finding that the plaintiffs hotnews misappropriation claim was preempted by federal copyright law federal preemptionedit the court recalled that in order to determine whether a statelaw claim is preempted by the federal copyright act  usc §  sets forth a two part test the general scope requirement if the impugned statelaw claim seeks to vindicate legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under  usc §  and the subject matter requirement if the work in question is of the type of works protected by the copyright act under  usc §  and  usc §  the second circuit found that the plaintiffs recommendations satisfied the subject matter requirement as well as the general scope requirement of the copyright act they held that the hotnews misappropriation exemption from preemption carved out in the nba case was explicitly intended to be narrow in scope in addition they characterized the part test that was set out in nba and applied by the district court as obiter dictum judge raggi in a separate concurring opinion disagreed with the majority that the nba test was dictum and would have held that although preemption occurred the part test was valid but had been misapplied in the court below organizations concerned about the second circuits rulingedit the case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors the electronic frontier foundation citizen media law project and public citizen inc filed an amicus curiae brief urging the second circuit court to take into consideration the first amendment as it related to the district court judgements potential restraints on americans abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day google and twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hotnews misappropriation tort the second circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the courts power and not relevant to the case the newspaper association of america the new york times company philadelphia media holdings stephens media time and the washington post filed an amicus brief the securities industry and financial markets association dow jones  company and the investorside research association each filed amicus briefs second circuits humorous footnotesedit ironyedit in recounting the story of the case the second circuit court wrote that they find little to take issue with in the district courts careful findings of facts to which we must in any event defer we therefore borrow freely from them these sentences are followed by a footnote which reads the irony of doing so in the context of a copyrightinfringement and hot newsmisappropriation case is not lost on us footnote  biblical referencesedit the second circuit court comments on the district courts characterization of the defendants behavior as having a biblical tone where the district court asserts that the defendant had reaped where it had not sown this claim is then footnoted by the second circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the bible in the bible that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise see eg galatians  god is not mocked for whatever a man sows that he will also reap but cf leviticus  setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown

found that the claims of three major financial investment firms barclays investment bank morgan stanley and merrill lynch against an internet subscription stock news service theflyonthewallcom for hotnews misappropriation under state common law doctrine could not stand as they were preempted by several sections of the federal copyright act  usc §   usc §  and  usc §  the case was significant because the second circuit redefined elements of the hotnews misappropriation tort breaking with earlier second circuit precedent by holding that such precedent was not binding but merely obiter dicta

inc was a company that was in the business of obtaining by various means daily stock recommendations prepared by the plaintiffs lehman brothers later purchased by barclays investment bank morgan stanley and merrill lynch in their highly soughtafter research reports the defendant sold a service wherein subscribers could receive these recommendations prior to their release by the plaintiffs to the general public the plaintiffs claimed that the value of the reports to their own clients was predicated on the reports exclusivity accuracy and timely release they were often only valuable during the few hours before the stock market would open and whose value to the firms in turn was predicated on their potential to attract and retain clients to entice clients to execute stock trades through them and to differentiate themselves from other financial services firms and for generating revenue by way of commissions earned from facilitating trades on behalf of those clients on june   the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against theflyonthewallcom ordering them to cease distributing portions of the exclusive research reports as well as the recommendations within them the plaintiffs sought to base their request for injunctive relief on two sets of legal claims  claims that the defendant had violated their copyright in the research reports by verbatim copying and dissemination of portions of the reports and  claims that the defendant had committed the commonlaw tort of hotnews misappropriation by publishing the recommendations within the reports in the procedural leadup to the trial the defendants essentially conceded their liability under the copyright claim thus at a bench trial before the district court for the southern district of new york the remaining issues to be tried were the appropriate relief for the copyright claim as well as liability and relief for the hotnews misappropriation claim on march   the district court found in favour of the plaintiffs issuing an injunction ordering the defendants to cease their publication of the plaintiffs reports and recommendations see summary of the courts decision below shortly thereafter the defendants appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit the defendants abandoned their defence against the copyright claims and focused solely on the hotnews

occurred the part test was valid but had been misapplied in the court below organizations concerned about the second circuits rulingedit the case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors the electronic frontier foundation citizen media law project and public citizen inc filed an amicus curiae brief urging the second circuit court to take into consideration the first amendment as it related to the district court judgements potential restraints on americans abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day google and twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hotnews misappropriation tort the second circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the courts power and not relevant to the case the newspaper association of america the new york times company philadelphia media holdings stephens media time and the washington post filed an amicus brief the securities industry and financial markets association dow jones  company and the investorside research association each filed amicus briefs second circuits humorous footnotesedit ironyedit in recounting the story of the case the second circuit court wrote that they find little to take issue with in the district courts careful findings of facts to which we must in any event defer we therefore borrow freely from them these sentences are followed by a footnote which reads the irony of doing so in the context of a copyrightinfringement and hot newsmisappropriation case is not lost on us footnote  biblical referencesedit the second circuit court comments on the district courts characterization of the defendants behavior as having a biblical tone where the district court asserts that the defendant had reaped where it had not sown this claim is then footnoted by the second circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the bible in the bible that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise see eg galatians  god is not mocked for whatever a man sows that he will also reap but cf leviticus  setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown
