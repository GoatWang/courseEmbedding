one ear for political nuanceclumsy handling of one flap after another cost him coke boards confidencehow to irritate the europeans by wall street journal staff reporters betsy mckay nikhil deogun and joanne lublin    atlanta  the job of running a giant company like cocacola co is akin to conducting an orchestrabut m douglas ivester it seems had a tin ear just over two years ago mr ivester was widely considered the ideal successor to roberto goizueta the revered and longserving chairman of coke a brilliant and driven financial strategist mr ivester worked at mr goizuetas side for more than a decade and was the architect of much of cokes success during that timedirectors marveled at mr ivesters intensity his attention to even minute details warren buffett was fond of telling how he had once noticed that his grandsons favorite pizza parlor in omaha neb served pepsi and how he mentioned this to mr ivester in passing  only to find that the next time he stopped in the place was serving coke mr ivester looks at anytime anyone swigs any beverage other than a coke product as a personal insult said mr buffett whose berkshire hathaway inc is cokes biggest shareholderafter mr goizuetas death in october  mr buffett expressed nothing but confidence in mr ivester mr goizuetas greatest legacy is the way he so carefully selected and then nurtured the future leadership of his company mr buffett said other directors evidently felt similarly a board meeting to pick the new chairman and chief executive lasted a mere  minutesno great calamity has befallen the mighty company since then the companys earnings have been under pressure during his tenure but a big reason for that the severe asian economic downturn was clearly not of the ceos making yet this month the yearold mr ivester abruptly announced he will step down in april and about all he said by way of explanation was that he had come to believe our company will now best be served by fresh leadership that will bring its own energy to bear the board quickly promoted douglas daft who ran cokes middle and far east divisions to president and chief operating officer and designated him to succeed mr ivesterthe story of how this happened is one of powerful board members and stockholders gradually coming to the conclusion that cocacola was headed down the wrong path under mr ivester it wasnt the obvious problem of weakening earnings and a gyrating stock price though coke has suffered those woes but rather something more elusive mr ivesters tone deafness in his handling of a series of small crisesalone none was so bad but taken together they worried the member board some of whose members felt that mr ivester wasnt listening to them mr ivesters way of handling controversies made the company he loved seem insensitive and arrogant not only did his personal image suffer but more troubling to the board members the image of the company sufferedand important people were watching mr ivesters performance people like mr buffett herbert a allen a director and head of allen  co a new york investment bank that is a large coke shareholder and donald keough cokes former no  and now allen  cos chairmanit isnt clear whether an ultimatum was ever given to mr ivester although several people close to the company say none was instead they say the ceo sized up the situation himself he knew he wasnt gaining the confidence of people out there one of these people notesone of mr ivesters worst missteps came in october and involved carl ware the chief of cokes africa division and its highestranking black executive mr ivester decided on a management reorganization that meant mr ware would no longer report directly to the chief executive  in effect a demotion such a move would need to be carefully handled by any ceo but especially the chief of cocacola the company faces an employee lawsuit alleging racial discriminationthrough the backandforth of the wellpublicized suit mr ware had stood at mr ivesters side agreeing in may to be cohead of a companywide diversity committee mr ware former president of atlantas city council is the face of cocacola to much of the city and was a symbol of how africanamericans could advance at atlantas most famous company called one of the  most powerful blacks in corporate america by ebony magazine mr ware was also one of a dozen executives to join president clinton on a trip to africa in  this is a guy you light candles around says a person close to the boardso how did mr ivester break the news to mr ware by telephone to the executive who was in europe say several people mr ware soon announced his retirement set for the end of next year to board members as well as some current and former executives mr ivesters handling of the matter was hamhanded ware was a big blunder says a person close to the companyhad this been the only misstep mr ivester might have survived but there had been other incidents earlier in his tenure his persistent attempts in the face of foreigngovernment opposition to acquire french soda company orangina and the overseas business of cadbury schweppes painted a bullseye on coke for overseas regulators cokes handling of a contamination scare in belgium brought the company heavy criticism in europethen mr ivester discussed in an interview with a brazilian newsmagazine cokes testing of wireless technology that would enable vending machines to change prices based on the weather translation the hotter the weather the higherpriced the coke to mr ivester the accountant the concept was just the law of supply and demand in action to the board the ensuing flap was murphys law at workfor a consumerproduct company that in the words of a person close to the board is a giant image machine the pummeling of cokes image was increasingly intolerableall along mr ivester resisted directors advice to name a no  executive to help him with daytoday duties and serve as a sounding board for decisions and just last month he managed to anger coke bottlers by deciding to raise the price of softdrink concentrate next year by twice as much as usualsome directors had known all along that mr ivester was a little rough around the edges famous for a takenoprisoners attitude but they expected him to grow into the morestatesmanlike role of chairman as board members of coke they were accustomed to plaudits during the year goizueta reign now they began to get questions from ordinary people asking whats wrong with cokethe directors arent blind says a person close to the board they started to think it was naive to suppose mr ivester would develop on the job ceo skills that he lacked its like telling a person who doesnt have a sense of humor to be funny this person says adding that the conclusion began to form in some directors minds that they had picked the wrong guythere was never any complaint about mr ivesters devotion to coke he was a driven man the son of a factory foreman from the tiny cottonmill town of new holland ga mr ivester became an accountant and joined coke in  after a stint as its outside auditor often reporting to his office at seven in the morning and working seven days a week he quickly climbed through the rankshe impressed both mr goizueta and mr keough with his financial ingenuity and passion to succeed after being named chief financial officer in  at the age of  he engineered a big consolidation of cokes bottlers that gave the company greater control over the bottling system while wiping assets and debt off its balance sheettold he could either count money or earn it he then chose the operations side he became head of the european business and then ran the flagship us businesseverything mr ivester did he did by the book studying management texts and getting tutoring in skills that he lacked such as marketing he kept a folder of articles on management and leadership highlighted and marked for followup reading he kept handy a copy of lifes little instruction book sample advice keep a tight rein on your temper and a slim  book called matters of importance which advised be courteous pleasant and always friendly to people you come in contact withsubordinates got a taste of his attention to detail when he gave all us employees laminated cards with numbers to call if they ever saw a vending machine out of stock or anything else askewmr ivesters critics and fans always worried that he lacked the engaging manner and diplomatic skills of the aristocratic mr goizueta without a ready wit to soften his aggressiveness mr ivester sometimes came off as highhanded or ruthless in his first speech to the softdrink industry after becoming president he dismayed some listeners by likening rival firms to parasites or sheep  and coke to a wolf but for every time mr ivester drew blood with his comments or his style there was always mr goizueta to wipe it off says a highranking former executivealthough mr ivester was mr goizuetas choice as successor by the early s mr goizuetas  decision to postpone his retirement beyond age  was seen as a sign that mr ivester needed more groomingthen in october  mr goizueta died of lung cancer coke was in just about the best shape in its year history it commanded a  share of the world market for soft drinks and the stock was a wall street favorite mr ivester  seemingly adept at handling both data and people  looked like the person to keep this string going fortune magazine dubbed him the prototype boss for the st centurymr ivesters ways werent mr goizuetas where his illustrious predecessor had remained aloof from the daytoday business mr ivester was handson board members urged him to recognize that coke was too big a company for one person to run without a secondincommand but he said he wanted to delayer the organization and didnt need a filter instead of appointing a president he himself kept in touch with  executives who reported to him directlydespite the outward confidence some people who know mr ivester say he was unsure he could follow in mr goizuetas footsteps for one thing he had been very close to his mentor his mother ada mae ivester says he was heartbroken over mr goizuetas death she recalls mentioning to her husband on the day of mr goizuetas funeral buck hes never going to get through thisanother person says mr ivester seemed to have felt most at ease as no  to mr goizueta mr ivester was very comfortable with him and would have loved to have him stay on as chairman he may not ever have gotten over itmr goizueta had been gone scarcely two months when trouble hit the longinvincible coke empire as asian economies  the key to cokes longterm growth  imploded analysts reduced their earnings estimates at a company that was renowned for its earnings predictability estimate cuts became a common event as the crisis spread to russia and then to latin america given the cause of the troubles investors and board members didnt hold mr ivester responsiblebut a year into his job they did start to wonder about some of his decisions mr ivesters first big move as ceo was an attempt to acquire orangina from pernod ricard sa while the price of  million was huge for such a small brand the board and wall street bought mr ivesters rationale that coke could take this undeveloped brand and profitably run it through cokes massive distribution system it seemed another adroit strategic move by mr ivesterby september  it looked anything but adroit the government of france decided to reject the bid for the quintessentially french drink after coke rival pepsico inc argued that such a takeover would harm softdrink competition in france coke got early signals of the french decision and some people close to mr ivester recommended he withdraw the bid before the turndown was announced instead mr ivester plowed ahead ultimately losing the effort but managing to trigger news stories in europe suggesting that alreadygiant coke was trying to take over the softdrink market a coke spokesman says the company was contractually bound to pursue the acquisition until the french government made a final decisionthe company lost an incredible amount of credibility with orangina says one person close to the company its not smart to give up all your political credits for  cases of somethingit was a similar story a few months later in december  when mr ivester sought to buy rival cadbury schweppess overseas brands the effort was initially blocked in several countries including australia and mexico again on the argument that coke already had too much market poweralthough coke got the deal done in  countries mr ivester had to scale down the bid to exclude much of europe and not before more bad press and a rapping of the knuckles by the european unions competition commissioner who accused coke of trying to circumvent the eu and pull the wool over our eyesfinally in four european countries eu antitrust officials armed with search warrants marched into offices of coke and bottling companies for two days they went through files looking for evidence that coke had abused its powerful market position the matter is still pendingcoke contends its dealings in europe are legally free of antitrust taint but to many experts that isnt the point they took the view that this was a legal process similar to ftc hearings in the us says a person close to coke they completely missed the point that its politicalmore evidence of mr ivesters deafness to european political nuance came during this years contamination scare in belgium and france in which more than  people complained of nausea and other symptoms after drinking coke products mr ivester who was in paris when the first schoolchildren fell ill flew home in the first few days of the crisis while coke officials declared that the products didnt pose a health hazard he kept silentat least one director counseled him to get himself quickly to belgium and speak up mr ivester said he wanted to respect a request from the belgian health minister to keep the matter behind closed doors and not use the press but board members advised him not to believe a politician sure enough the health minister himself appeared on belgian television and criticized cokea few months later came another publicrelations gaffe asked by a brazilian newsmagazine about cokes testing of vending machines that could change prices according to the weather mr ivester gave a theoretical response that came across as both a defense of the technology and a confirmation that it would hit the streets cocacola is a product whose utility varies from moment to moment he said in a final summer championship when people meet in a stadium to have fun the utility of a cold cocacola is very high so it is fair that it should be more expensive the machine will simply make this process automatica coke spokesman says the remarks were taken out of context though the company had tested the technology in a lab it never had an intention of introducing it the spokesman says and bottlers confirm this nonetheless the ceos answer created a flap seeming to cast the company as one that wasnt customerfriendlyin october directors who had long wanted mr ivester to appoint a no  were relieved when he outlined plans to reduce the number of executives reporting to him to six from  the new arrangement would free the ceo from overseeing employee benefits corporate aircraft and many other mundane issues mr ivester told directors he would seek their approval at the next board meeting in middecemberwhy wait they replied i appreciate your support lets go mr ivester told the board according to one personthe board apparently failed to notice one ramification mr ivester was about to push mr ware the executive overseeing the africa business down a rung he was among the  who would no longer report to the ceo when mr ware then announced his retirement there was a lot of criticism in the company about why it was necessary to make carl lose so much face and what that meant about dougs judgment says a person close to the situationas these controversies unfolded one person says mr ivester occasionally talked of stepping down wondering aloud if he was the right man for the job mr ivesters mother  who says she is elated that he has given up the ultrastressful job  says he had sometimes talked about leaving a coke spokesman though says he never heard mr ivester express any desire to leavethe end came on dec  when mr ivester announced that he will voluntarily leave one of the most prestigious jobs in business next april after only   years to give someone else a chance to try to do it better says a person close to the board it was like a pitcher who wasnt throwing any strikes and the bases are loaded he finally took himself out of the gamecarrick mollenkamp contributed to this article cokes board of directors  cathleen black president hearst corps hearst magazines
