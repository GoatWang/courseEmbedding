image of a singlewalled carbon nanotube most singlewalled nanotubes swnts have a diameter of close to  nanometer and can be many millions of times longer the structure of a swnt can be conceptualized by wrapping a oneatomthick layer of graphite called graphene into a seamless cylinder the way the graphene sheet is wrapped is represented by a pair of indices nm the integers n and m denote the number of unit vectors along two directions in the honeycomb crystal lattice of graphene if m   the nanotubes are called zigzag nanotubes and if n  m the nanotubes are called armchair nanotubes otherwise they are called chiral the diameter of an ideal nanotube can be calculated from its nm indices as follows d  a π  n   n m  m       n  m   − n m  p m   where a   nm swnts are an important variety of carbon nanotube because most of their properties change significantly with the nm values and this dependence is nonmonotonic see kataura plot in particular their band gap can vary from zero to about  ev and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior singlewalled nanotubes are likely candidates for miniaturizing electronics the most basic building block of these systems is the electric wire and swnts with diameters of an order of a nanometer can be excellent conductors one useful application of swnts is in the development of the first intermolecular fieldeffect transistors fet the first intermolecular logic gate using swcnt fets was made in  a logic gate requires both a pfet and an nfet because swnts are pfets when exposed to oxygen and nfets otherwise it is possible to expose half of an swnt to oxygen and protect the other half from it the resulting swnt acts as a not logic gate with both p and ntype fets in the same molecule prices for singlewalled nanotubes declined from around  per gram as of  to retail prices of around  per gram of asproduced – by weight swnts as of march  as of  the retail price of asproduced  by weight swnts were  per gram cheap enough for widespread use swnts are forecast to make a large impact in electronics applications by  according to the global market for carbon nanotubes report multiwallededit a scanning electron microscopy image of carbon nanotubes bundles triplewalled armchair carbon nanotube multiwalled nanotubes mwnts consist of multiple rolled layers concentric tubes of graphene there are two models that can be used to describe the structures of multiwalled nanotubes in the russian doll model sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders eg a  singlewalled nanotube swnt within a larger  singlewalled nanotube in the parchment model a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper the interlayer distance in multiwalled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite approximately  å the russian doll structure is observed more commonly its individual shells can be described as swnts which can be metallic or semiconducting because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes one of the shells and thus the whole mwnt is usually a zerogap metalcitation needed doublewalled carbon nanotubes dwnts form a special class of nanotubes because their morphology and properties are similar to those of swnts but they are more resistant to chemicals this is especially important when it is necessary to graft chemical functions to the surface of the nanotubes functionalization to add properties to the cnt covalent functionalization of swnts will break some cc double bonds leaving holes in the structure on the nanotube and thus modifying both its mechanical and electrical properties in the case of dwnts only the outer wall is modified dwnt synthesis on the gramscale was first proposed in  by the ccvd technique from the selective reduction of oxide solutions in methane and hydrogen the telescopic motion ability of inner shells and their unique mechanical properties will permit the use of multiwalled nanotubes as main movable arms in coming nanomechanical devices retraction force that occurs to telescopic motion caused by the lennardjones interaction between shells and its value is about  nn junctions and crosslinkingedit transmission electron microscope image of carbon nanotube junction junctions between  or more nanotubes have been widely discussed theoretically such junctions are quite frequently observed in samples prepared by arc discharge as well as by chemical vapor deposition the electronic properties of such junctions were first considered theoretically by lambin et al who pointed out that a connection between metallic tube and a semiconducting one would represent a nanoscale heterojunction such a junction could therefore form a component of a nanotubebased electronic circuit the image on the right shows a junction between two multiwalled nanotubes junctions between nanotubes and graphene have been considered theoretically but not widely studied experimentally such junctions form the basis of pillared graphene in which parallel graphene sheets are separated by short nanotubes pillared graphene represents a class of threedimensional carbon nanotube architectures d carbon scaffolds recently several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate threedimensional macroscopic  nm in all three dimensions allcarbon devices lalwani et al have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricate macroscopic freestanding porous allcarbon scaffolds using single and multiwalled carbon nanotubes as building blocks these scaffolds possess macro micro and nano structured pores and the porosity can be tailored for specific applications these d allcarbon scaffoldsarchitectures may be used for the fabrication of the next generation of energy storage supercapacitors field emission transistors highperformance catalysis photovoltaics and biomedical devices and implants other morphologiesedit a stable nanobud structure carbon nanobuds are a newly created material combining two previously discovered allotropes of carbon carbon nanotubes and fullerenes in this new material fullerenelike buds are covalently bonded to the outer sidewalls of the underlying carbon nanotube this hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes in particular they have been found to be exceptionally good field emitters in composite materials the attached fullerene molecules may function as molecular anchors preventing slipping of the nanotubes thus improving the composite’s mechanical properties a carbon peapod is a novel hybrid carbon material which traps fullerene inside a carbon nanotube it can possess interesting magnetic properties with heating and irradiation it can also be applied as an oscillator during theoretical investigations and predictions in theory a nanotorus is a carbon nanotube bent into a torus doughnut shape nanotori are predicted to have many unique properties such as magnetic moments  times larger than previously expected for certain specific radii properties such as magnetic moment thermal stability etc vary widely depending on radius of the torus and radius of the tube graphenated carbon nanotubes are a relatively new hybrid that combines graphitic foliates grown along the sidewalls of multiwalled or bamboo style cnts the foliate density can vary as a function of deposition conditions eg temperature and time with their structure ranging from few layers of graphene   to thicker more graphitelike the fundamental advantage of an integrated graphenecnt structure is the high surface area threedimensional framework of the cnts coupled with the high edge density of graphene depositing a high density of graphene foliates along the length of aligned cnts can significantly increase the total charge capacity per unit of nominal area as compared to other carbon nanostructures cupstacked carbon nanotubes cscnts differ from other quasid carbon structures which normally behave as quasimetallic conductors of electrons cscnts exhibit semiconducting behaviors due to the stacking microstructure of graphene layers extreme carbon nanotubesedit cycloparaphenylene the observation of the longest carbon nanotubes grown so far are over  m  mm long was reported in  these nanotubes were grown on si substrates using an improved chemical vapor deposition cvd method and represent electrically uniform arrays of singlewalled carbon nanotubes the shortest carbon nanotube is the organic compound cycloparaphenylene which was synthesized in  the thinnest carbon nanotube is the armchair  cnt with a diameter of  nm this nanotube was grown inside a multiwalled carbon nanotube assigning of carbon nanotube type was done by a combination of highresolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem raman spectroscopy and density functional theory dft calculations the thinnest freestanding singlewalled carbon nanotube is about  nm in diameter researchers suggested that it can be either  or  swcnt but the exact type of carbon nanotube remains questionable   and  carbon nanotubes all about  nm in diameter were unambiguously identified using aberrationcorrected highresolution transmission electron microscopy inside doublewalled cnts the highest density of cnts was achieved in  grown on a conductive titaniumcoated copper surface that was coated with cocatalysts cobalt and molybdenum at lower than typical temperatures of  °c the tubes averaged a height of  nm and a mass density of  g cm− the material showed ohmic conductivity lowest resistance ∼ kω propertiesedit mechanicaledit main article mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively this strength results from the covalent sp bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms in  a multiwalled carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of  gigapascals  psi for illustration this translates into the ability to endure tension of a weight equivalent to  kilogramsforce  n  lbf on a cable with crosssection of  square millimetre  sq in further studies such as one conducted in  revealed that individual cnt shells have strengths of up to ≈ gigapascals  psi which is in agreement with quantumatomistic models since carbon nanotubes have a low density for a solid of  to  gcm its specific strength of up to  kn·m·kg− is the best of known materials compared to highcarbon steels  kn·m·kg− although the strength of individual cnt shells is extremely high weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few gpa this limitation has been recently addressed by applying highenergy electron irradiation which crosslinks inner shells and tubes and effectively increases the strength of these materials to ≈ gpa for multiwalled carbon nanotubes and ≈ gpa for doublewalled carbon nanotube bundles cnts are not nearly as strong under compression because of their hollow structure and high aspect ratio they tend to undergo buckling when placed under compressive torsional or bending stress on the other hand there was evidence that in the radial direction they are rather soft the first transmission electron microscope observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the van der waals forces can deform two adjacent nanotubes later nanoindentations with atomic force microscope were performed by several groups to quantitatively measure radial elasticity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and tappingcontact mode atomic force microscopy was also performed on singlewalled carbon nanotubes youngs modulus of on the order of several gpa showed that cnts are in fact very soft in the radial direction electricaledit band structures computed using tight binding approximation for  cnt zigzag metallic  cnt semiconducting and  cnt armchair metallic unlike graphene which is a twodimensional semimetal carbon nanotubes are either metallic or semiconducting along the tubular axis for a given nm nanotube if n  m the nanotube is metallic if n − m is a multiple of  and n ≠ m and nm ≠  then the nanotube is quasimetallic with a very small band gap otherwise the nanotube is a moderate semiconductor  thus all armchair n  m nanotubes are metallic and nanotubes   etc are semiconducting carbon nanotubes are not semimetallic because the degenerate point that point where the π bonding band meets the π antibonding band at which the energy goes to zero is slightly shifted away from the k point in the brillouin zone due to the curvature of the tube surface causing hybridization between the σ and π antibonding bands modifying the band dispersion the rule regarding metallic versus semiconductor behavior has exceptions because curvature effects in small diameter tubes can strongly influence electrical properties thus a  swcnt that should be semiconducting in fact is metallic according to the calculations likewise zigzag and chiral swcnts with small diameters that should be metallic have a finite gap armchair nanotubes remain metallic in theory metallic nanotubes can carry an electric current density of  ×  acm which is more than  times greater than those of metals such as copper where for copper interconnects current densities are limited by electromigration carbon nanotubes are thus being explored as interconnects conductivity enhancing components in composite materials and many groups are attempting to commercialize highly conducting electrical wire assembled from individual carbon nanotubes there are significant challenges to be overcome however such as undesired current saturation under voltage the much more resistive nanotubetonanotube junctions and impurities all of which lower the electrical conductivity of the macroscopic nanotube wires by orders of magnitude as compared to the conductivity of the individual nanotubes because of its nanoscale crosssection electrons propagate only along the tubes axis as a result carbon nanotubes are frequently referred to as onedimensional conductors the maximum electrical conductance of a singlewalled carbon nanotube is g where g  eh is the conductance of a single ballistic quantum channel due to the role of the πelectron system in determining the electronic properties of graphene doping in carbon nanotubes differs from that of bulk crystalline semiconductors from the same group of the periodic table eg silicon graphitic substitution of carbon atoms in the nanotube wall by boron or nitrogen dopants leads to ptype and ntype behavior respectively as would be expected in silicon however some nonsubstitutional intercalated or adsorbed dopants introduced into a carbon nanotube such as alkali metals as well as electronrich metallocenes result in ntype conduction because they donate electrons to the πelectron system of the nanotube by contrast πelectron acceptors such as fecl or electrondeficient metallocenes function as ptype dopants since they draw πelectrons away from the top of the valence band intrinsic superconductivity has been reported although other experiments found no evidence of this leaving the claim a subject of debate opticaledit main article optical properties of carbon nanotubes carbon nanotubes have useful absorption photoluminescence fluorescence and raman spectroscopy properties spectroscopic methods offer the possibility of quick and nondestructive characterization of relatively large amounts of carbon nanotubes there is a strong demand for such characterization from the industrial point of view numerous parameters of the nanotube synthesis can be changed intentionally or unintentionally to alter the nanotube quality as shown below optical absorption photoluminescence and raman spectroscopies allow quick and reliable characterization of this nanotube quality in terms of nontubular carbon content structure chirality of the produced nanotubes and structural defects those features determine nearly any other properties such as optical mechanical and electrical properties carbon nanotubes are unique onedimensional systems which can be envisioned as rolled single sheets of graphite or more precisely graphene this rolling can be done at different angles and curvatures resulting in different nanotube properties the diameter typically varies in the range – nm ie only  times but the length can vary  times reaching  cm the nanotube aspect ratio or the lengthtodiameter ratio can be as high as  which is unequalled by any other material consequently all the properties of the carbon nanotubes relative to those of typical semiconductors are extremely anisotropic directionally dependent and tunable whereas mechanical electrical and electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear the aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics in particular lightemitting diodes leds and photodetectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab their unique feature is not the efficiency which is yet relatively low but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light and the possibility of its fine tuning through the nanotube structure in addition bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of singlewalled carbon nanotubes crystallographic defects also affect the tubes electrical properties a common result is lowered conductivity through the defective region of the tube a defect in armchairtype tubes which can conduct electricity can cause the surrounding region to become semiconducting and single monatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties thermoedit main article thermodynamics of nanostructures § carbon nanotubes all nanotubes are expected to be very good thermal conductors along the tube exhibiting a property known as ballistic conduction but good insulators lateral to the tube axis measurements show that an individual swnt has a roomtemperature thermal conductivity along its axis of about  w·m−·k− compare this to copper a metal well known for its good thermal conductivity which transmits  w·m−·k− an individual swnt has a roomtemperature thermal conductivity across its axis in the radial direction of about  w·m−·k− which is about as thermally conductive as soil macroscopic assemblies of nanotubes such as films or fibres have reached up to  w·m−·k− so far the temperature stability of carbon nanotubes is estimated to be up to  °c in vacuum and about  °c in air crystallographic defects strongly affect the tubes thermal properties such defects lead to phonon scattering which in turn increases the relaxation rate of the phonons this reduces the mean free path and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotube structures phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of highfrequency optical phonons however largerscale defects such as stone wales defects cause phonon scattering over a wide range of frequencies leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity synthesisedit main article synthesis of carbon nanotubes techniques have been developed to produce nanotubes in sizable quantities including arc discharge laser ablation highpressure carbon monoxide disproportionation and chemical vapor deposition cvd most of these processes take place in a vacuum or with process gases the cvd growth method is popular as it yields high purity and has a high degree of control over diameter length and morphology using particulate catalysts large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making cnts more commercially viable vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays are also grown by thermal chemical vapor deposition a substrate quartz silicon stainless steel etc is coated with a catalytic metal fe co ni layer typically that layer is iron and is deposited via sputtering to a thickness of – nm a – nm underlayer of alumina is often also put down on the substrate first this imparts controllable wetting and good interfacial properties when the substrate is heated to the growth temperature  °c the continuous iron film breaks up into small islands… each island then nucleates a carbon nanotube the sputtered thickness controls the island size and this in turn determines the nanotube diameter thinner iron layers drive down the diameter of the islands and they drive down the diameter of the nanotubes grown the amount of time that the metal island can sit at the growth temperature is limited as they are mobile and can merge into larger but fewer islands annealing at the growth temperature reduces the site density number of cntmm while increasing the catalyst diameter chemical modificationedit main articles carbon nanotube chemistry and selective chemistry of singlewalled nanotubes carbon nanotubes can be functionalized to attain desired properties that can be used in a wide variety of applications the two main methods of carbon nanotube functionalization are covalent and noncovalent modifications because of their hydrophobic nature carbon nanotubes tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts the resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite the surface of the carbon nanotubes can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment applicationsedit currentedit current use and application of nanotubes has mostly been limited to the use of bulk nanotubes which is a mass of rather unorganized fragments of nanotubes bulk nanotube materials may never achieve a tensile strength similar to that of individual tubes but such composites may nevertheless yield strengths sufficient for many applications bulk

devices and implants large quantities of pure cnts can be made into a fiber aka filament by wet spinning the fiber is either directly spun from the synthesis pot or spun from premade dissolved cnts individual fibers can be turned into a yarn apart from its strength and flexibility the main advantage is making an electrically conducting yarn the electronic properties of individual cnt fibers ie bundle of individual cnt is governed by the twodimensional structure of cnts at  k cnt fibers have a conductivity one order of magnitude higher than the best electrical conductors cntbased yarns are

studies have indicated that some of these nanoscale particles may pose a greater health risk than the larger bulk form of these materials in  niosh published a current intelligence bulletin detailing

evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulations based on evaluation of the potentially hazardous properties of swcnt based on this registration swcnt commercialization is allowed in the eu up to  metric tons currently the type of swcnt registered through reach is limited to the specific type of single wall carbon nanotubes manufactured by ocsial which submitted the application historyedit see also timeline of carbon nanotubes and fullerene § history the true identity of the discoverers of carbon nanotubes is a subject of some controversy a  editorial written by marc monthioux and vladimir kuznetsov in the journal carbon described the interesting and oftenmisstated origin of the carbon nanotube a large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow nanometersize tubes composed of graphitic carbon to sumio iijima of nec in  he published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry of excitement and could be credited by inspiring the many scientists now studying applications of carbon nanotubes though iijima has been given much of the credit for discovering carbon nanotubes it turns out that the timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than  in  l v radushkevich and v m lukyanovich published clear images of  nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the soviet journal of physical chemistry this discovery was largely unnoticed as the article was published in russian and western scientists access to soviet press was limited during the cold war monthioux and kuznetsov mentioned in their carbon editorial the fact is radushkevich and lukyanovich  should be credited for the discovery that carbon filaments could be hollow and have a nanometer size diameter that is to say for the discovery of carbon nanotubes in  morinobu endo of cnrs observed hollow tubes of rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapourgrowth technique the first specimens observed would later come to be known as singlewalled carbon nanotubes swnts endo in his early review of vaporphasegrown carbon fibers vpcf also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core this appears to be the observation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber the massproduced mwcnts today are strongly related to the vpgcf developed by endo in fact they call it the “endoprocess” out of respect for his early work and patents in  john abrahamson presented evidence of carbon nanotubes at the th biennial conference of carbon at pennsylvania state university the conference paper described carbon nanotubes as carbon fibers that were produced on carbon anodes during arc discharge a characterization of these fibers was given as well as hypotheses for their growth in a nitrogen atmosphere at low pressures in  a group of soviet scientists published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide using tem images and xrd patterns the authors suggested that their “carbon multilayer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders they speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible they suggested two possibilities of such arrangements circular arrangement armchair nanotube and a spiral helical arrangement chiral tube in  howard g tennent of hyperion catalysis was issued a us patent for the production of cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils with a constant diameter between about  and about  nanometers length  times the diameter and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core iijimas discovery of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the insoluble material of arcburned graphite rods in  and mintmire dunlap and whites independent prediction that if singlewalled carbon nanotubes could be made then they would exhibit remarkable conducting properties helped create the initial buzz that is now associated with carbon nanotubes nanotube research accelerated greatly following the independent discoveries by bethune at ibm and iijima at nec of singlewalled carbon nanotubes and methods to specifically produce them by adding transitionmetal catalysts to the carbon in an arc discharge the arc discharge technique was wellknown to produce the famed buckminster fullerene on a preparative scale and these results appeared to extend the run of accidental discoveries relating to fullerenes the discovery of nanotubes remains a contentious issue many believe that iijimas report in  is of particular importance because it
