unrealized gains or losses previously recognized the company reports current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments in the statement of operations as part of the valuation process management may take into account the following types of factors if relevant in determining the fair value of the companys investments the enterprise value of a portfolio company the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time the nature and realizable value of any collateral the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow the markets in which the portfolio company does business a comparison of the portfolio companys securities to any similar publicly traded securities changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant factors when an external event such as a purchase transaction public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs management considers the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate its valuation because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in its portfolio the company values substantially all of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by management as described in note  due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value the fair value of the companys investments may fluctuate from period to period additionally the fair value of the companys investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the company may ultimately realize further such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities if the company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale the company could realize significantly less than the value at which the company has recorded it in addition changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned deferred offering costs offering costs are expenses such as legal fees pertaining to the companys shares

waiver of   fair value of financial instruments the companys fair value accounting policies adhere to the provisions of fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  topic asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available  observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company  unobservable inputs reflect the companys assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances  the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows      integrity capital income fund inc notes to financial statements period ended january   unaudited         level   valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access  valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to level  securities  since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment     level   valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly     level   valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement   to the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment  those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by the company in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in level   in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy  in such cases for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entityspecific measure  therefore even when market assumptions are not readily available the companys own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date the company invests in direct debt and equity securities that are not traded on a public market  these securities are recorded at fair value as determined by the company using the framework of topic asc   in addition the company has adopted written guidelines for determining the fair value of its investments for reporting in the accompanying financial statements  under these guidelines investment valuations are reviewed on a quarterly basis and investments without readily available market values are valued at fair value as determined by the company  in the absence of readily ascertainable market values the company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market income and cost approaches as prescribed by topic asc  in order to estimate the fair value of investments  in all cases the company evaluates whether the valuation techniques used and the resultant fair value estimate is representative of what the most likely buyers of the company would also pay upon exit and therefore whether the value is deemed to be the price expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date    integrity capital income fund inc notes to financial statements period ended january   unaudited     under topic asc  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  asc  permits the company as a practical expedient to estimate the fair value of investments in other investment companies based on the net asset value nav per share or its equivalent if the nav of such investments is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of asc  financial services — investment companies as such the companys estimate of fair value for its investments in other investment companies is generally based on the nav provided to the company by each investee fund supported by the independently audited financial statements of the investee fund when available the transaction price is typically the companys best estimate of fair value at inception of the investment  when evidence supports a change to the carrying value from the transaction price adjustments are made to reflect expected exit values  ongoing reviews by the company are based on an assessment of significant assumptions related to each underlying investment including incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties the financial condition and operating results of the portfolio company achievement of technical milestones and expected cash flows  all investments at january   and october   had no readily available market value and are included in level  of the fair value hierarchy the following tables present information about the companys assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at january   and october    the company assesses the levels for the investments at each measurement date and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the companys accounting policy regarding the recognitions of transfers between levels of the fair value

uncertainties the company in the normal course of business makes investments in financial instruments where the risk of potential loss exists due to changes in the market market risk or failure or inability of the counterparty to a transaction to perform credit and counterparty risk see below for a detailed description of select principal risks market risk market risk is the companys investments in financial instruments and derivatives that expose it to various risks such as but not limited to interest rate foreign currency and equity interest rate risk is the risk that a fixed income investments value will change due to a change in the absolute level of interest rates in the spread between two rates in the shape of the yield curve or in any other interest rate relationship such changes usually affect securities inversely and can be reduced by diversifying for example investing in fixed income securities with different durations or hedging for example through an interest rate swap equity risk equity risk is the risk that the market values of equities such as common stocks or equity related investments such as futures and options may decline due to general market conditions such as political or macroeconomic factors additionally equities may decline in value due to specific factors affecting a related industry or industries equity securities and equity related investments generally have greater market price volatility than fixed income securities credit and counterparty risk the company is exposed to credit risk to counterparties with whom it transacts with and also bears the risk of settlement default the company may lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security or the counterparty to a derivative instrument contract repurchase agreement or securities lending is unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or to otherwise honor its obligations securities are subject to varying degrees of credit risk which are often reflected in credit ratings the company minimizes concentrations of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a diverse population of counterparties with a history of good credit quality further the company manages counterparty risk by entering into appropriate legally enforceable master netting agreements or similar agreements which include provisions for offsetting positions collateral or both in the event of counterparty default or nonperformance  indemnifications the company has provided general indemnifications to the adviser any affiliate of the adviser and any person acting on behalf of the adviser or such affiliate when they act in good faith in the best interest of the company the company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote

topic —financial services—investment companies asc topic  in the opinion of management the financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented          integrity capital income fund inc notes to financial statements three and nine months ended july   unaudited       use of estimates   financial statements prepared on a gaap basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes  actual results could differ from those estimates  such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein  investment valuation represents a significant estimate within these financial statements   reclassification of prior year presentation   certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation these reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal  the company concluded it was appropriate to capitalize loan origination fees charged on promissory notes as a reduction to the initial cost of the investment and accrete such amounts over the estimated life of the investment as interest income previously such fees were deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the investment accordingly the company had revised the classification to report these amounts as interest income on investments corresponding reclassifications have also been made to the statements of cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal year  this change in classification does not materially affect previously reported cash flows from operations or from financing activities in the statements of cash flows and had no effect on the previously reported statements of operations for any period   cash and cash equivalents   the company deposits its cash in financial institutions and at times such balances may be in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits however management does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk   fair value of investments   the companys fair value accounting policies adhere to the provisions of fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures topic asc   topic asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available  observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company  unobservable inputs reflect the companys assumption about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances  the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows   leve    valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access  valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to level  securities  since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment   leve    valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly   leve    valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement          integrity capital income fund inc notes to financial statements three and nine months ended july   unaudited         to the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment  those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined   because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by the company in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in level   in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy  in such cases for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement   fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entityspecific measure  therefore even when market assumptions are not readily available the companys own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date see further description of fair value methodology in note    deferred offering costs   offering costs are expenses such as legal fees pertaining to the companys shares offered for sale the company has accounted for offering costs in the current period as a deferred charge deferred offering costs on the statements of assets liabilities and net assets the deferred offering costs are being amortized to expense over  months
