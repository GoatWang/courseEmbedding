when you compare mutual funds it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers it’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods characteristics of core funds that added value two screens can help sharpen your search source capital group based on morningstar® data narrowing your search the sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming we examined the large universe of equity funds in morningstar’s us and foreign largecap categories over a year period and looked for funds with two traits those within the lowest  of expenses and those within the highest  in manager ownership we found that the funds with both characteristics highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors look for funds that meet two key criteria largecap equity funds with low expense ratios and high manager ownership source capital group based on morningstar data boosting success rates as shown in the chart below not all funds are equal most in fact rarely outpace the index however funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers and funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that significantly the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five and year periods a portfolio of largecap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership on average outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds since largecap funds account for a big part of most portfolios those higher success rates can result in substantial gains two steps raised

risk index funds fall as far as the market they track but investors don’t have to over time they can gain more by losing less august  share gain by losing less there are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market losing less – the socalled lowdownside capture approach – holds appeal for investors especially considering that  of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to  of market downturns  downside capture a fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness for example if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only  as far as the market its downside capture ratio is  if it fell  more than the market its downside capture ratio is   see how american funds delivered indexbeating returns by losing less a closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our us stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times  why it matters consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for longterm investors funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride making it easier for those with longterm objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets the arithmetic of loss the ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss consider the following if a  investment loses  its value drops to  in order for the investment to return to the  level that  must do more than gain  which would only bring it to  it needs to double digging out of a hole is never easy but the shallower the hole the shorter the climb better positioned by losing less the farther an investment falls the longer the path back to break even some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound to mitigate risk seek funds that have held up better during declines looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness when we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has on average delivered indexbeating results finding funds that can mitigate risk within the universe of large cap us funds screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that on average outpaced its peers as well as the sp  index further narrowing the lowdownside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further the chart shown here is based on data for rolling fiveyear periods for the  years ended december   see methodology investments are not fdicinsured nor are they deposits
