development companies bdcs and real estate investment trusts reits there are certain risks specific to the financials sector and in particular bdcs and reits including the potential adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and state and federal regulations this trust invests in bdcs and will be subject to risks associated with bdcs bdcs are closedend funds that have elected to be treated as business development companies and their ability to grow their overall financial condition is impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital engage in borrowing acquire suitable investments and maintain their status as a bdc failure to do so will adversely affect the value of a bdc’s shares bdcs generally employ leverage in their portfolios while leverage often increases the yield of a portfolio it may magnify the potential for gains and losses on amounts invested and accordingly may increase the volatility andor risks associated with those shares a bdc’s investments are frequently not publicly traded and as a result there is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments bdcs are subject to laws or regulations governing bdcs that could negatively affect the value of the bdc shares shares of bdcs frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of a bdc’s shares may decrease this trust invests in reits and real estate companies many factors can have an impact on the performance of reits and real estate companies including cash available for distribution the credit quality of a particular reit or the real estate industry in general risks associated with ownership of real estate include global and local economic conditions decline in real estate values changes in interest rates and the strength or weakness of the real estate market you will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses but also those of the underlying bdcs and reits which frequently have high expenses including but not limited to management fees and operational expenses by investing in bdcs and reits through the trust investors incur greater expenses than they would incur if they invested directly in the bdcs and reits bdcs and reits may invest in foreign securities which involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the united states this may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries us or foreign tax treatment and the potential lack of liquidity government supervision and regulation bdcs may invest in securities of small and midcap companies securities of small and midcap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information bdcs and reits may invest in fixed income securities fixed income securities are subject to various risks including interest rate credit call and quality risk in general the value of the fixed income securities will fall if interest rates rise in a declining interestrate environment the portfolio may generate less income a security issuer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future also the longer the period to maturity the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be bdcs may invest in high yield debt securities high yield debt securities are generally below investment grade quality “noninvestment grade” debt investing in such debt should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such debt noninvestment grade debt is subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates economic recession deterioration of the noninvestment grade debt markets possible downgrades and payment defaults of interest andor principal noninvestment grade debt prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated debt and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree bdcs and reits operate in a highly competitive
