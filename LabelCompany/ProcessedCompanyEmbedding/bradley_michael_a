it needs its mommyeventually found what i wanted at two upscale furniture stores in butler and monroevilleand much better quality and donated the the sofa and chair from bradley michaelshelpfulshareflagcdulingoverallthe salespeople were very knowthe salespeople were very knowledgeable and willing to take questions by phone and work with us to find the perfect items for our home everyone was exceptionally courteous and polite i never felt ignored or that they werent willing to help as others eluded in addition we were kept wellinformed of the time frame necessary for our special order to arrive it arrived as promised and we are very happy with the results we will definitely go there again in the futurehelpfulshareflagdoclewoverallmy wife and i are repeat customy wife and i are repeat customers it saddens me to see negative reviews because the people at bradley michaels have provided the best salesperson experience weve ever known they dont pressure or hassle you and it is common sense that special order pieces take time to be special ordered  everyone knows that weve been remodeling the house and have returned to bradley michael each time to add a modern look to our home brad was wonderful and worked with my wife to choose furniture suitable to our tastes this time i got my rustic man cave couldnt be happierhelpfulshareflagbestcriticoverallawesome experience the owner awesome experience the owner took his time showing my husband and i around the showroom and even made a house call to help us plan our new living room i cannot describe how in love i am with our new room they went beyond our expectations choosing the perfect accessories wonderful people wonderful resultshelpfulshareflagreviewerprovided by citysearch  overallhorrible experience  good furniture bad businessreceiving good service from bradley michaels furniture is an unpredictable thing in mid january of  my wife and i ordered a kingsize wooden bed made by mobel inc mobel has a limited number of distributors for their products and bradley michaels was the closest in proximity to where we live initially the bed had shipped and arrived at our home within five weeks of requesting it considering that the bed first needed to be manufactured by mobel then be sent to bradley michaels and finally delivered to us waiting only one month and a week was not bad at all additionally the delivery service was free however during the process of installation bradley michaels delivery men severely damaged the headboard piece with a rubber mallet they were having difficulties passing the piece through the door frame and figured that by hammering off one of the legs and the molding at the top they would be able to get it into the bedroom what could be more ridiculous than professional furniture movers beating the crap out the furniture in order to assemble it i went into the store the following day and personally informed michael of what happened as i offered him various pictures that i had printed out of the damage he said he only wanted one however he called me two days later asking me to write an email to his service department with the pictures i had taken not that it is a big deal but i did not expect to do the leg work to fix a problem that his associated created especially when i had already offered him the same pictures in person from here on out the experience only gets much worse michael had told me that i would have to wait about three weeks for a replacement headboard to come in when three weeks had passed i called michael to check on the status and he told me that the the headboard was already made but that the truck at mobel would not be able to ship it until the overall load met the minimum weight requirement and that id have to wait another ten days now let it be said that when a furniture company sends a delivery service that damages its merchandise actually the customers merchandise since  was withdrawn from my account the day i ordered the bed and then does not deliver the replacement part by the time the owner had indicated the customer should not have to wait any longer the company should be responsible for a fast and efficient shipping method even if it be fed ex review continued under comment sectionhelpfulflagpbprovided by citysearch  overallworst furniture experience  do not buyif i could give a negative star rating on our experience thus far i would do so i will never by furniture from these guys again at this point we spent a significant sum on furniture for our family room and dining room this past summer the furniture took several months to be delivered and there have been problems since the first piece arrived run from these guys they lure you in with a great showroom friendly staff and an accommodatingconsultative approach but buyer bewarequality of the furniture is horrible and service after the sale nonexistent example  chairs for dining room table are not properly stained have stripped bolts underneath and lose legs the absolutely worst craftsmanship ive ever seen it has been several months since we logged our first complaint and customer service call no one has fixed anything to date despite numeours promises example  our leather chair and ottoman have cheap finishes that come off every time something is placed on them and removed it looks horrible after about  months of use i have a leather couch in another room that weve owned for over  years with less loss of finish and a completely different level of construction quality hancock and moore that costs the same againplaced multiple service calls and nothing has been done to date beyond frustrated with our furniture from bradley michaelshelpfulflagpizzakingprovided by citysearch  overallstill
