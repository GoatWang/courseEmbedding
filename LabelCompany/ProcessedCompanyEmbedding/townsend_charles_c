acts but died before their detrimental effects became apparent the townshend acts were a series of british acts passed beginning in  and relating to the british american colonies in north america the acts are named after charles townshend the chancellor of the exchequer who proposed the program historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading townshend acts but five acts are often mentioned the revenue act of  the indemnity act  the commissioners of customs act  the vice admiralty court act  and the new york restraining act  the purpose of the townshend acts was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to great britain to create a more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations to punish the province of new york for failing to comply with the  quartering act and to establish the precedent that the british parliament had the right to tax the colonies the townshend

newly expanded empire the british parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of british america previously through the trade and navigation acts parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire but with the sugar act of  parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue american colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved the americans claimed they were not represented in parliament but the british government retorted they had virtual representation a concept the americans rejected this issue only briefly debated following the sugar act became a major point of contention following parliaments passage of the  stamp act the stamp act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies contributing to its repeal the following year along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised implicit in the stamp act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation the question of the extent of parliaments authority in the colonies parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the stamp act in  by simultaneously passing the declaratory act which proclaimed that parliament could legislate for the colonies in all cases whatsoever townshends programedit raising revenueedit the first of the townshend acts sometimes simply known as the townshend act was the revenue act of  this act represented the chatham ministrys new approach for generating tax revenue in the american colonies after the repeal of the stamp act in  the british government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the stamp act on the grounds that it was a direct or internal tax colonists would therefore accept indirect or external taxes such as taxes on imports with this in mind charles townshend the chancellor of the exchequer devised a plan that placed new duties on paper paint lead glass and tea that were imported into the colonies these were items that were not produced in north america and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from great britain the colonists objection to internal taxes did not mean that they would accept external taxes the colonial position was that any tax laid by parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional townshends mistaken belief that americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional wrote historian john phillip reid was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the revolution the townshend revenue act received the royal assent on  june  there was little opposition expressed in parliament at the time never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage wrote historian peter thomas the revenue act was passed in conjunction with the indemnity act of  which was intended to make the tea of the british east india company more competitive with smuggled dutch tea the indemnity act repealed taxes on tea imported to england allowing it to be reexported more cheaply to the colonies this tax cut in england would be partially offset by the new revenue act taxes on tea in the colonies the revenue act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance or general search warrants which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods the original stated purpose of the townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in north america townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan however and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges previously the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries but parliament hoped to take the power of the purse away from the colonies according to historian john c miller townshend ingeniously sought to take money from americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies some members of parliament objected because townshends plan was expected to generate only £ in yearly revenue but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established the programme could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves according to historian peter thomas townshends aims were political rather than financial american board of customs commissionersedit to better collect the new taxes the commissioners of customs act of  established the american board of customs commissioners which was modeled on the british board of customs the board was created because of the difficulties the british board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies five commissioners were appointed to the board which was headquartered in boston the american customs board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the british government according to historian oliver m dickerson the actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board the american board of customs commissioners was notoriously corrupt according to historians political scientist peter andreas argues merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it such customs racketeering was in the view of colonial merchants essentially legalized piracy historian edmund morgan says in the establishment of this american board of customs commissioners americans saw the extension of englands corrupt system of officeholding to america as professor dickerson has shown the commissioners were indeed corrupt they engaged in extensive customs racketeering and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between england and the colonies it was on their request that troops were sent to boston the boston massacre took place before their headquarters the gaspee was operating under their orders historian doug krehbiel argues disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the british government vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt—customs officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused john hancock the wealthy new england merchant had his ship liberty seized in  on a false charge incensing the colonists charges against hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in britain another measure to enforce the trade laws was the vice admiralty court act of  although often included in discussions of the townshend acts this act was initiated by the cabinet when townshend was not present and was not passed until after his death before this act there was just one vice admiralty court in north america located in halifax nova scotia established in  this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies and so the  vice admiralty court act created four district courts which were located at halifax boston philadelphia and charleston one purpose of the vice admiralty courts which did not have juries was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations townshend also faced the problem of what to do about the new york provincial assembly which had refused to comply with the  quartering act because its members saw the acts financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax the new york restraining act which according to historian robert chaffin was officially a part of the townshend acts suspended the power of the assembly until it complied with the quartering act the restraining act never went into effect because by the time it was passed the new york assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the quartering act the assembly avoided conceding the right of parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the quartering act when appropriating this money they also passed a resolution stating that parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature reactionedit townshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies but he argued that the superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now the townshend acts did not create an instant uproar like the stamp act had done two years earlier but before long opposition to the programme had become widespread townshend did not live to see this reaction having died suddenly on september   dickinsons letters from a farmer in pennsylvania the most influential colonial response to the townshend acts was a series of twelve essays by john dickinson entitled letters from a farmer in pennsylvania which began appearing in december  eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies dickinson argued that there was no difference between internal and external taxes and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low since this would set a dangerous precedent dickinson sent a copy of his letters to james otis of massachusetts informing otis that whenever the cause of american freedom is to be vindicated i look towards the province of massachusetts bay the massachusetts house of representatives began a campaign against the townshend acts by first sending a petition to king george asking for the repeal of the revenue act and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies asking them to join the resistance movement upon receipt of the massachusetts circular letter other colonies also sent petitions to the king virginia and pennsylvania also sent petitions to parliament but the other colonies did not believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of parliaments sovereignty over them parliament refused to consider the petitions of virginia and pennsylvania in great britain lord hillsborough who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of colonial secretary was alarmed by the actions of the massachusetts house in april  he sent a letter to the colonial governors in america instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the massachusetts circular letter he also sent a letter to massachusetts governor francis bernard instructing him to have the massachusetts house rescind the circular letter by a vote of  to  the house refused to comply and bernard promptly dissolved the legislature boycottsedit nonimportation agreement dated october  signed by bostonians including paul revere merchants in the colonies some of them smugglers organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their british counterparts to work for repeal of the townshend acts boston merchants organized the first nonimportation agreement which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain british goods effective  january  merchants in other colonial ports including new york city and philadelphia eventually joined the boycott in virginia the nonimportation effort was organized by george washington and george mason when the virginia house of burgesses passed a resolution stating that parliament had no right to tax virginians without their consent governor lord botetourt dissolved the assembly the members met at raleigh tavern and adopted a boycott agreement known as the association the nonimportation movement was not as effective as promoters had hoped british exports to the colonies declined by  percent in  but there were many merchants who did not participate in the boycott the boycott movement began to fail by  and came to an end in  unrest in bostonedit paul reveres engraving of british troops landing in boston in  the newly created american customs board was seated in boston and so it was there that the board concentrated on strictly enforcing the townshend acts the acts were so unpopular in boston that the customs board requested naval and military assistance commodore samuel hood complied by sending the fiftygun warship hms romney which arrived in boston harbor in may  on june   customs officials seized the liberty a sloop owned by leading boston merchant john hancock on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling bostonians already angry because the captain of the romney had been impressing local sailors began to riot customs officials fled to castle william for protection with john adams serving as his lawyer hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a viceadmiralty court but the charges were eventually dropped given the unstable state of affairs in massachusetts hillsborough instructed governor bernard to try to find evidence of treason in boston parliament had determined that the treason act  was still in force which would allow bostonians to be transported to england to stand trial for treason bernard could find no one who was willing to provide reliable evidence however and so there were no treason trials the possibility that american colonists might be arrested and sent to england for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies even before the liberty riot hillsborough had decided to send troops to boston on  june  he instructed general thomas gage commanderinchief north america to send such force as you shall think necessary to boston although he conceded that this might lead to consequences not easily foreseen hillsborough suggested that gage might send one regiment to boston but the liberty incident convinced officials that more than one regiment would be needed people in massachusetts learned in september  that troops were on the way samuel adams organized an emergency extralegal convention of towns and passed resolutions against the imminent occupation of boston but on  october  the first of four regiments of the british army began disembarking in boston and the customs commissioners returned to town the journal of occurrences an anonymously written series of newspaper articles chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers during the military occupation of boston apparently with some exaggeration tensions rose after christopher seider a boston teenager was killed by a customs employee on  february  although british soldiers were not involved in that incident resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed resulting in the killing of five civilians in the boston massacre of  march  after the incident the troops were withdrawn to castle william partial repealedit on the th of march — the same day as the boston massacre although news travelled slowly at the time and neither side of the atlantic were aware of this coincidence—lord north the new prime minister presented a motion in the house of commons that called for partial repeal of the townshend revenue act although some in parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act north disagreed arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert the right of taxing the americans after debate the repeal act received the royal assent on  april  historian robert chaffin argued that little had actually changed it would be inaccurate to claim that a major part of the townshend acts had been repealed the revenueproducing tea levy the american board of customs and most important the principle of making governors and magistrates independent all remained in fact the modification of the townshend duties act was scarcely any change at all the townshend duty on tea was retained when the  tea act was passed which allowed the east india company to ship tea directly to the colonies the boston tea party soon followed which set the stage for the american revolution notesedit  dickerson navigation acts – for example writes that there were four townshend acts and does

links backgroundedit following the seven years war – the british empire was deep in debt to help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire the british parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of british america previously through the trade and navigation acts parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire but with the sugar act of  parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue american colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved the americans claimed they were not represented in parliament but the british government retorted they had virtual representation a concept the americans rejected this issue only briefly debated following the sugar act became a major point of contention following parliaments passage of the  stamp act the stamp act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies contributing to its repeal the following year along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised implicit in the stamp act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation the question of the extent of parliaments authority in the colonies parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the stamp act in  by simultaneously passing the declaratory act which proclaimed that parliament could legislate for the colonies in all cases whatsoever townshends programedit raising revenueedit the first of the townshend acts sometimes simply known as the townshend act was the revenue act of  this act represented the chatham ministrys new approach for generating tax revenue in the american colonies after the repeal of the stamp act in  the british government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the stamp act on the grounds that it was a direct or internal tax colonists would therefore accept indirect or external taxes such as taxes on imports with this in mind charles townshend the chancellor of the exchequer devised a plan that placed new duties on paper paint lead glass and tea that were imported into the colonies these were items that were not produced in north america and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from great britain the colonists objection to internal taxes did not mean that they would accept external taxes the colonial position was that any tax laid by parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional townshends mistaken belief that americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional wrote historian john phillip reid was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the revolution the townshend revenue act received the royal assent on  june  there was little opposition expressed in parliament at the time never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage wrote historian peter thomas the revenue act was passed in conjunction with the indemnity act of  which was intended to make the tea of the british east india company more competitive with smuggled dutch tea the indemnity act repealed taxes on tea imported to england allowing it to be reexported more cheaply to the colonies this tax cut in england would be partially offset by the new revenue act taxes on tea in the colonies the revenue act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance or general search warrants which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods the original stated purpose of the townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in north america townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan however and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges previously the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries but parliament hoped to take the power of the purse away from the colonies according to historian john c miller townshend ingeniously sought to take money from americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies some members of parliament objected because townshends plan was expected to generate only £ in yearly revenue but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established the programme could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves according to historian peter thomas townshends aims were political rather than financial american board of customs commissionersedit to better collect the new taxes the commissioners of customs act of  established the american board of customs commissioners which was modeled on the british board of customs the board was created because of the difficulties the british board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies five commissioners were appointed to the board which was headquartered in boston the american customs board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the british government according to historian oliver m dickerson the actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board the american board of customs commissioners was notoriously corrupt according to historians political scientist peter andreas argues merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it such customs racketeering was in the view of colonial merchants essentially legalized piracy historian edmund morgan says in the establishment of this american board of customs commissioners americans saw the extension of englands corrupt system of officeholding to america as professor dickerson has shown the commissioners were indeed corrupt they engaged in extensive customs racketeering and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between england and the colonies it was on their request that troops were sent to boston the boston massacre took place before their headquarters the gaspee was operating under their orders historian doug krehbiel argues disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the british government vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt—customs officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused john hancock the wealthy new england merchant had his ship liberty seized in  on a false charge incensing the colonists charges against hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in britain another measure to enforce the trade laws was the vice admiralty court act of  although often included in discussions of the townshend acts this act was initiated by the cabinet when townshend was not present and was not passed until after his death before this act there was just one vice admiralty court in north america located in halifax nova scotia established in  this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies and so the  vice admiralty court act created four district courts which were located at halifax boston philadelphia and charleston one purpose of the vice admiralty courts which did not have juries was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations townshend also faced the problem of what to do about the new york provincial assembly which had refused to comply with the  quartering act because its members saw the acts financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax the new york restraining act which according to historian robert chaffin was officially a part of the townshend acts suspended the power of the assembly until it complied with the quartering act the restraining act never went into effect because by the time it was passed the new york assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the quartering act the assembly avoided conceding the right of parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the quartering act when appropriating this money they also passed a resolution stating that parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature reactionedit townshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies but he argued that the superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now the townshend acts did not create an instant uproar like the stamp act had done two years earlier but before long opposition to the programme had become widespread townshend did not live to see this reaction having died suddenly on september   dickinsons letters from a farmer in pennsylvania the most influential colonial response to the townshend acts was a series of twelve essays by john dickinson entitled letters from a farmer in pennsylvania which began appearing in december  eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies dickinson argued that there was no difference between internal and external taxes and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low since this would set a dangerous precedent dickinson sent a copy of his letters to james otis of massachusetts informing otis that whenever the cause of american freedom is to be vindicated i look towards the province of massachusetts bay the massachusetts house of representatives began a campaign against the townshend acts by first sending a petition to king george asking for the repeal of the revenue act and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies asking them to join the resistance movement upon receipt of the massachusetts circular letter other colonies also sent petitions to the king virginia and pennsylvania also sent petitions to parliament but the other colonies did not believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of parliaments sovereignty over them parliament refused to consider the petitions of virginia and pennsylvania in great britain lord hillsborough who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of colonial secretary was alarmed by the actions of the massachusetts house in april  he sent a letter to the colonial governors in america instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the massachusetts circular letter he also sent a letter to massachusetts governor francis bernard instructing him to have the massachusetts house rescind the circular letter by a vote of  to  the house refused to comply and bernard promptly dissolved the legislature boycottsedit nonimportation agreement dated october  signed by bostonians including paul revere merchants in the colonies some of them smugglers organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their british counterparts to work for repeal of the townshend acts boston merchants organized the first nonimportation agreement which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain british goods effective  january  merchants in other colonial ports including new york city and philadelphia eventually joined the boycott in virginia the nonimportation effort was organized by george washington and george mason when the virginia house of burgesses passed a resolution stating that parliament had no right to tax virginians without their consent governor lord botetourt dissolved the assembly the members met at raleigh tavern and adopted a boycott agreement known as the association the nonimportation movement was not as effective as promoters had hoped british exports to the colonies declined by  percent in  but there were many merchants who did not participate in the boycott the boycott movement began to fail by  and came to an end in  unrest in bostonedit paul reveres engraving of british troops landing in boston in  the newly created american customs board was seated in boston and so it was there that the board concentrated on strictly enforcing the townshend acts the acts were so unpopular in boston that the customs board requested naval and military assistance commodore samuel hood complied by sending the fiftygun warship hms romney which arrived in boston harbor in may  on june   customs officials seized the liberty a sloop owned by leading boston merchant john hancock on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling bostonians already angry because the captain of the romney had been impressing local sailors began to riot customs officials fled to castle william for protection with john adams serving as his lawyer hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a viceadmiralty court but the charges were eventually dropped given the unstable state of affairs in massachusetts hillsborough instructed governor bernard to try to find evidence of treason in boston parliament had determined that the treason act  was still in force which would allow bostonians to be transported to england to stand trial for treason bernard could find no one

first of the townshend acts sometimes simply known as the townshend act was the revenue act of  this act represented the chatham ministrys new approach for generating tax revenue in the american colonies after the repeal of the stamp act in  the british government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the stamp act on the grounds that it was a direct or internal tax colonists would therefore accept indirect or external taxes such as taxes on imports with this in mind charles townshend the chancellor of the exchequer devised a plan that placed new duties on paper paint lead glass and tea that were imported into the colonies these were items that were not produced in north america and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from great britain the colonists objection to internal taxes did not mean that they would accept external taxes the colonial position was that any tax laid by parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional townshends mistaken belief that americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional wrote historian john phillip reid was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the revolution the townshend revenue act received the royal assent on  june  there was little opposition expressed in parliament at the time never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage wrote historian peter thomas the revenue act was passed in conjunction with the indemnity act of  which was intended to make the tea of the british east india company more competitive with smuggled dutch tea the indemnity act repealed taxes on tea imported to england allowing it to be reexported more cheaply to the colonies this tax cut in england would be partially offset by the new revenue act taxes on tea in the colonies the revenue act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance or general search warrants which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods the original stated purpose of the townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in north america townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan however and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges previously the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries but parliament hoped to take the power of the purse away from the colonies according to historian john c miller townshend ingeniously sought to take money from americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies some members of parliament objected because townshends plan was expected to generate only £ in yearly revenue but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established the programme could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves according to historian peter thomas townshends aims were political rather than financial american board of customs commissionersedit to better collect the new taxes the commissioners of customs act of  established the american board of customs commissioners which was modeled on the british board of customs the board was created because of the difficulties the british board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies five commissioners were appointed to the board which was headquartered in boston the american customs board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the british government according to historian oliver m dickerson the actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board the american board of customs commissioners was notoriously corrupt according to historians political scientist peter andreas argues merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it such customs racketeering was in the view of colonial merchants essentially legalized piracy historian edmund morgan says in the establishment of this american board of customs commissioners americans saw the extension of englands corrupt system of officeholding to america as professor dickerson has shown the commissioners were indeed corrupt they engaged in extensive customs racketeering and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between england and the colonies it was on their request that troops were sent to boston the boston massacre took place before their headquarters the gaspee was operating under their orders historian doug krehbiel argues disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the british government vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt—customs officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused john hancock the wealthy new england merchant had his ship liberty seized in  on a false charge incensing the colonists charges against hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in britain another measure to enforce the trade laws was the vice admiralty court act of  although often included in discussions of the townshend acts this act was initiated by the cabinet when townshend was not present and was not passed until after his death before this act there was just one vice admiralty court in north america located in halifax nova scotia established in  this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies and so the  vice admiralty court act created four district courts which were located at halifax boston philadelphia and charleston one purpose of the vice admiralty courts which did not have juries was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations townshend also faced the problem of what to do about the new york provincial assembly which had refused to comply with the  quartering act because its members saw the acts financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax the new york restraining act which according to historian robert chaffin was officially a part of the townshend acts suspended the power of the assembly until it complied with the quartering act the restraining act never went into effect because by the time it was passed the new york assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the quartering act the assembly avoided conceding the right of parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the quartering act when appropriating this money they also passed a resolution stating that parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature reactionedit townshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies but he argued that the superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now the townshend acts did not create an instant uproar like the stamp act had done two years earlier but before long opposition to the programme had become widespread townshend did not live to see this reaction having died suddenly on september   dickinsons letters from a farmer in pennsylvania the most influential colonial response to the townshend acts was a series of twelve essays by john dickinson entitled letters from a farmer in pennsylvania which began appearing in december  eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies dickinson argued that there was no difference between internal and external taxes and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low since this would set a dangerous precedent dickinson sent a copy of his letters to james otis of massachusetts informing otis that whenever the cause of american freedom is to be vindicated i look towards the province of massachusetts bay the massachusetts house of representatives began a campaign against the townshend acts by first sending a petition to king george asking for the repeal of the revenue act and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies asking them to join the resistance movement upon receipt of the massachusetts circular letter other colonies also sent petitions to the king virginia and pennsylvania also sent petitions to parliament but the other colonies did not believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of parliaments sovereignty over them parliament refused to consider the petitions of virginia and pennsylvania in great britain lord hillsborough who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of colonial secretary was alarmed by the actions of the massachusetts house in april  he sent a letter to the

 january  merchants in other colonial ports including new york city and philadelphia eventually joined the boycott in virginia the nonimportation effort was organized by george washington and george

of treason in boston parliament had determined that the treason act  was still in force which would allow bostonians to be transported to england to stand trial for treason bernard could find no one who was willing to provide reliable evidence however and so there were no treason trials the possibility that american colonists might be arrested and sent to england for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies even before the liberty riot hillsborough had decided to send troops to boston on  june  he instructed general thomas gage commanderinchief north america to send such force as you shall think necessary to boston although he conceded that this might lead to consequences not easily foreseen hillsborough suggested that gage might send one regiment to boston but the liberty incident convinced officials that more than one regiment would be needed people in massachusetts learned in september  that troops were on the way samuel adams organized an emergency extralegal convention of towns and passed resolutions against the imminent occupation of boston but on  october  the first of four regiments of the british army began disembarking in boston and the customs commissioners returned to town the journal of occurrences an anonymously written series of newspaper articles chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers during the military occupation of boston apparently with some exaggeration tensions rose after christopher seider a boston teenager was killed by a customs employee on  february  although british soldiers were not involved in that incident resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed resulting in the killing of five civilians in the boston massacre of  march  after the incident the troops were withdrawn to castle william partial repealedit on the th of march — the same day as the boston massacre although news travelled slowly at the time and neither side of the atlantic were aware of this coincidence—lord north the new prime minister presented a motion in the house of commons that called for partial repeal of the townshend revenue act although some in parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act north disagreed arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert the right of taxing the americans after debate the repeal act received the royal assent on  april  historian robert chaffin argued that little had actually changed it would be inaccurate to claim that a major part of the townshend acts had been repealed the revenueproducing tea levy the american board of customs and most important the principle of making governors and magistrates independent all remained in fact the modification of the townshend duties act was scarcely any change at all the townshend duty on tea was retained when the  tea act was passed which allowed the east india company to ship tea directly to the colonies the boston tea party soon followed which set the stage for the american

apparently with some exaggeration tensions rose after christopher seider a boston teenager was killed by a customs employee on  february  although british soldiers were not involved in that incident resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed resulting in the killing of five civilians in the boston massacre of  march  after the incident the troops were withdrawn to castle william partial repealedit on the th of march — the same day as the boston massacre although news travelled slowly at the time and neither side of the atlantic were aware of this coincidence—lord north the new prime minister presented a motion in the house of commons that called for partial repeal of the townshend revenue act although some in parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act north disagreed arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert the right of taxing the americans after debate the repeal act received the royal assent on  april  historian robert chaffin argued that little had actually changed it would be inaccurate to claim that a major part of the townshend acts had been repealed the revenueproducing tea levy the american board of customs and most important the principle of making governors and magistrates independent all remained in fact the modification of the townshend duties act was scarcely any change at all the townshend duty on tea was retained when the  tea act was passed which allowed the east india company to ship tea directly to the colonies the boston tea party soon followed which set the stage for the american revolution notesedit  dickerson navigation acts – for example writes that there were four townshend acts and does not mention the new york restraining act which chaffin says was officially a part of

november  r• with my post the other day on ok plantation bitters see ok plantation bitters – the “big boys” i thought i would circle back and look for information regarding charles lediard from new york who ‘supposedly’ represented the ok brand to me it is quite interesting that mr lediard would use so many shapes and colors for his bottles i thought i would find abundant information searching online but most of what i find is a series of pieces of information plus some directory listings from st louis listing franklin hastings as his st louis partner i guess we need to put the puzzle together i am specifically looking for confirmation of the brands represented by lediard advertising and lable examples who his partners or representatives were on the west coast and why some some of these bottles are found so far west of the mississippi it would also be nice to find out where these bottles were made was it lockport whitney or some other glass works i find all of this interesting because i do possess the triangular ok plantations bitters the square lediard’s ok plantation bitters the lediard’s celebrated stomach bitters and the lediard’s morning call bitters bottles in my

my knowledge the only example of the lediard’s stomach bitters discovered in sierra county i watched being broken a goodyears bar digger and i were putting a test hole in the back of a cabin site when he put his shovel through a beautiful teal blue iron pontiled example of this bottle the cabin site above indian valley and on the trail to indian hill is one of several cabin sites that were discovered while walking the area recent extensive logging operations in the area of the trail and townsite of indian hill have pretty much destroyed any traces of the trail and cabin sites that were located alongside of it although this is not a western manufactured bottle collectors believe it was distributed and marketed exclusively on the pacific coast western bitters and gold rush collectors rate this bottle as rare and consider it a very desirable addition to their collection rick simi – western bitters news new addition hello ferdinand enjoyed the post on the lediard bottles i have always been amazed at the variety of bottles produced for his products i was lucky enough to find one of the celebrated stomach bitters many years ago it has been one of my favorite bottles then about six years ago i got lucky again and found a beautiful mint julep pictured below yet another lediard product smooth based it looks to be the same color as the morning call bitters i also remember seeing a pair of the six sided bottles from st louis except they were embossed new york one was green and the other i would say similar in color to the st louis one in your post got to wonder if there
