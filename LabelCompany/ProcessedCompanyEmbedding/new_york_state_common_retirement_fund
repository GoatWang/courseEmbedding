charges against gregg schonhorn a vice president of fixed income sales at a new yorkbased brokerdealer “brokerdealer” who pled guilty and admitted to his participation in the scheme  us attorney preet bharara said  “today we allege a classic quidproquo bribery scheme at the new york state common retirement fund the third largest pension fund in the country  navnoor kang a former portfolio manager at the fund allegedly steered billions of dollars of business to brokerdealers who bribed him with luxury vacations highpriced watches drugs cash and more the hardearned pension savings of new yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt personal enrichment the intersection of public corruption and securities fraud appears to be a busy one but its one that we are committed to policing” fbi assistant directorincharge william f sweeney jr said  “instead of upholding his fiduciary duty kang was allegedly paid in bribes for diverting business to two separate brokerage firms  when it comes to retirement funds fixedincome investments are often thought of as a reliable choice  members of the new york state common retirement fund likely also relied on the belief that the man directing their investments was an honest public servant unfortunately as alleged that is not the case here today” according to the allegations in the indictment and information which were unsealed today in manhattan federal court the nyscrf the nyscrf was a pension fund administered for the benefit of public employees of the state of new york  the third largest pension fund in the united states the

head of portfolio strategy for the nyscrf  in that capacity kang was responsible for investing more than  billion in fixedincome securities and was entrusted with discretion to manage those investments on behalf of the nyscrf  kang owed a fiduciary duty to the nyscrf and its members and beneficiaries and was required to make investment decisions in their best interests and free of any conflict of interest  new york state law and nyscrf policies prohibited kang and other nyscrf employees from receiving any bribes gifts benefits or consideration of any kind the scheme to steer nyscrf fixedincome business in exchange for secret bribes from  through  kang kelley and schonhorn participated in a scheme to defraud the nyscrf and its members and beneficiaries and to deprive the nyscrf of its intangible right to kang’s honest services  the scheme involved among other things an agreement among kang kelley schonhorn and others to pay kang bribes – in the form of entertainment travel lavish meals prostitutes nightclub bottle service narcotics tickets to sports games and other events luxury gifts and cash payments for strippers and kang’s personal expenses – in exchange for fixedincome business from the nyscrf  such bribes – which totaled more than  – were strictly forbidden by the nyscrf and were paid secretly and without any disclosure to the nyscrf and its members and beneficiaries concerning the conflicts of interests inherent therein  in exchange for the bribes paid by kelley schonhorn and others kang used his position as director of fixed income and head of portfolio strategy at the nyscrf to promote the interests of kelley schonhorn and their respective brokerage firms  kang in exchange for the bribes he received agreed to steer fixedincome business to brokerdealer and brokerdealer  in fact kang steered more than  billion in fixedincome business to brokerdealer and brokerdealer from which kelley schonhorn and their respective employers earned millions of dollars in commissions from the nyscrf  in so doing kang with the knowledge and approval of kelley and schonhorn breached his fiduciary duty to make investment decisions in the best interest of the nyscrf and its members and beneficiaries and free of conflict and deprived the nyscrf of its intangible right to kang’s honest services as the bribes paid by schonhorn to kang increased so too did brokerdealer’s fixedincome business with the nyscrf  the value of the nyscrf’s domestic bond transactions with brokerdealer skyrocketed from zero in the fiscal year ending march   to approximately  million in the fiscal year ending march   to approximately  million in the fiscal year ending march   and to approximately  billion in the fiscal year ending march    brokerdealer became the third largest brokerdealer with which the nysrcf executed domestic bonds transactions for the fiscal year ending march   having not even been on the approved list in the fiscal year ending march    as the nyscrf’s third largest brokerdealer in this asset class brokerdealer brokered approximately eight percent of the total value of the nyscrf’s domestic bond transactions – a figure greater than that of all but two of the major international banks and brokerage houses on the list  similarly the value of nyscrf’s domestic bond transactions with brokerdealer increased from zero in the fiscal year ending march   to approximately  million in the fiscal year ending march   and to approximately  million in the fiscal year ending march    kang’s trades resulted in the payment of millions of dollars in commissions to brokerdealer and brokerdealer of which kelley and schonhorn personally earned approximately  to  percent the obstruction of justice in late  the securities and exchange commission “sec” opened an investigation into the entertainment and benefits that kelley had provided kang and the sec subpoenaed both kang and kelley for their testimony  in advance of their testimony kang and kelley agreed to align their stories and testify falsely before the sec in order to conceal their scheme  in late  and early  kang and kelley each falsely testified under oath before the sec about expenses kelley had paid for kang  moreover after a federal grand jury investigation was opened kang instructed schonhorn to testify falsely before the grand jury and kang admitted that he had hidden relevant evidence                                               kang  of portland oregon and kelley  of piedmont california are charged with the offenses set forth in the
