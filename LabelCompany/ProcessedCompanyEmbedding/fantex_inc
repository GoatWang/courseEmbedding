mewhort photograph by george gojkovich — getty imagessportshere’s why fantex the athlete stock exchange is workingdaniel robertsmar  not everyone wants to invest in mohamed sanu in fact many football fans may not have even heard of mohamed sanu but the cincinnati bengals receiver is trading highest  on the athlete stock platform fantex right nowtoday the platform announced it has entered into deals with two more players tennessee titans wide receiver kendall wright and indianapolis colts lineman jack mewhort this brings its stable to eightfantex inc launched almost exactly a year ago opening up shares in its first stock san francisco ers tight end vernon davis for  on april   these days daviss stock is down to  heres how it all works when fantex signs a new professional athlete it sets an amount that it will pay him—a onetime fee—in exchange for the athlete giving fantex a set percentage of all his future earnings on and off the field in perpetuity yes that means not just for the rest of his athletic career but the rest of his life hypothetically fantex must then sell enough shares in the ipo to make the amount it needs to pay the athlete if it fails to sell enough it will not complete the offering the pay check it offers each athlete varies chicago bears receiver alshon jeffery still the biggest name fantex has debuted got  million while davis got  millionthe stocks meanwhile are nontraditional tracking stocks with the price meant to reflect the current perceived success of the athlete and fantex holds all the power in the arrangement when you buy a share what youre actually buying is a share in fantex the company and most of the stocks are fluctuating very little so far staying close to the  price at which each stock debuts there isnt enough volatility for it to be particularly interesting yet however at  a share why wouldnt a big fan of a certain team invest in a star from that team even if just for fun think of it as akin to being a shareholder in the green bay packersas an investment the concept has been met with ridicule in some places many wall street traders think its stupid and risky fantex was supposed to debut with arian foster as the first stock but he got injured just before his ipo and the company delayed it and still hasnt gone ahead—it showed the inherent risk in the entire concept before the platform even launched felix salmon writing at reuters in  when fantex was first shopping around the concept labeled it bad investment of the day in our initial primer on the business we wrote that for the players who sign it is basically an elaborate pr stunt that is still the case since most of the players signing with fantex are not household names—dont expect peyton manning or drew brees to join up—and are looking for a way to quickly earn some press and promote their personal brand for stars with established fame and endorsement deals it wouldnt make sense to promise fantex any percentage of their future earnings they dont need the money fantex would pay them but for rising stars or those who dont yet have any offthefield deals it might be appealingthe two new athletes kendall wright and jack mewhort are two such names wright will get  million for  interest in his future income mewhort will get  million for the same percentage though the two of them are small names they represent the continued growth of fantexs portfolio and their signing shows that the concept is gaining traction in the nfl fantex has yet to sign any athletes from other sports but says it will ceo buck french also told fortune last year that he plans to go beyond sports to sign actors and other celebrities fox baseball columnist ken rosenthal in a piece last week about cleveland indians pitcher corey klubers ongoing contract talks even suggests kluber should sign with fantex as a lossofvalue policy a form of insurance for his futurethe four stocks currently trading on the site all reflect the recent fortunes of the athlete on the field which means that in one sense the concept is working as its intended sanu and jeffery who had good numbers last season are up sanu to  jeffery to  while vernon davis is down to  and buffalo bills quarterback ej manuel who played poorly has crashed to  st louis rams tackle michael brockers will be the next stock to go publiclast summer in a visit to fortune after the debut of his fantex stock vernon davis said he expected that soon “the whole world is going to believe” in fantex the company isnt quite there yet but its still chugging along and as it continues to sign new
