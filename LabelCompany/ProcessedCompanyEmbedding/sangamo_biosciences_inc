for hiv entry into tcells and if ccr is not expressed on their surface hiv infects them with lower efficiency the ccr delta mutation affords protection from hiv infection a population of individuals that is immune to hiv infection despite multiple exposures to the virus has been identified and extensively studied the majority of these individuals have a natural mutation ccr delta of both of their ccr gene copies homozygous resulting in the expression of a shortened nonfunctional ccr protein this mutation appears to have no observable deleterious effect individuals who carry the ccr delta mutation in only one of their two ccr gene copies heterozygotes tend to take longer to develop aids and are classified as socalled longterm nonprogressors in addition a study published in blood in december  reported an effective cure when an aids patient with leukemia received a bone marrow transplant from a matched donor who was homozygous for this delta ccr mutation this approach transferred the hematopoietic stem cells hscs residing from the bone marrow of the delta donor and provided a selfrenewable and potentially lifelong source of hivresistant immune cells after transplantation the aids patient was able to discontinue all antihiv drug treatments art cd counts increased and viral load dropped to an undetectable level demonstrating effective transplantation of protection from hiv infection the subject remains off art and is widely considered to be cured of his hiv infection using ccr mutations for therapeutic advantage we are using our zfnmediated genome editing technology to knock out the ccr gene in cells of a patient’s immune system both tcells and hematopoietic stem cells hscs which give rise to tcells to make these cells permanently resistant to hiv infection the aim is to provide a population of hivresistant cells that can fight hiv and opportunistic infections thereby mimicking the characteristics of individuals that carry the natural ccr delta mutation clinical

download as pdf september   richmond calif sept   prnewswire  sangamo biosciences inc nasdaq sgmo the leader in therapeutic genome editing announced today that the us food and drug administration fda has granted orphan drug designation to sbfix the companys zinc finger nuclease zfnmediated genome editing product candidate for the treatment of hemophilia b sangamo expects to initiate a phase  clinical study sbfix in adult subjects with the disease in  we are pleased with the fdas decision to grant orphan drug designation to sbfix for hemophilia b said geoff nichol mb chb sangamos executive vice president of research and development by enabling targeted integration of a therapeutic factor  gene our zfnmediated genome editing approach may offer hemophilia b patients a therapeutic option that has potential advantages over conventional gene therapy approaches we will enroll adult hemophilia patients into our first clinical trial however our goal is to move into pediatric patients a population we believe could particularly benefit from a treatment that has the potential to provide lifelong expression of therapeutic levels of factor ix protein our mission is to translate our groundbreaking science into genetic therapies that transform patients lives said sandy macrae mb chb phd sangamos president and chief executive officer this is another positive step forward for the first therapeutic in vivo genome editing application cleared for clinical evaluation in humans i am pleased with the progress that we have made to advance this program and we look forward to initiating a phase  clinical trial by the end of  the fda grants orphan drug designation to investigational drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than  people in the us orphan drug status is intended to facilitate drug development for rare diseases and provides several benefits to drug developers including assistance with clinical study design and drug development tax credits for qualified clinical trials costs exemptions from certain fda application fees and seven years of market exclusivity upon regulatory product approval sangamos in vivo genome editing approachsbfix is designed as a single treatment strategy intended to provide stable continuous production of factor ix clotting protein fix for the lifetime of the patient sangamos zfnmediated in vivo genome editing approach makes use of the albumin gene locus a highly expressing and liverspecific genomic safeharbor site that can be edited with zfns to accept and express therapeutic genes the approach is designed to enable the patients liver to permanently produce circulating therapeutic levels of a corrective protein product the ability to permanently integrate the therapeutic gene in a highly specific targeted fashion significantly differentiates sangamos in vivo genome editing approach from conventional aav cdna gene therapy approaches which are nonintegrating and may wash out of the liver as cells divide and turn over ultimately the target population for these programs will include pediatric patients and it will be important in this population to be able to produce stable levels of therapeutic protein for the lifetime of the patient with such a large capacity for protein production approximately gday of albumin targeting and coopting only a very small percentage of the albumin genes capacity is sufficient to produce the needed replacement protein at therapeutically relevant levels with no significant effect on albumin production about hemophilia bhemophilia a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot normally is caused by mutations in genes that encode factors which help the blood clot and stop bleeding when blood vessels are injured hemophilia b is caused by a defect in the gene encoding clotting factor ix protein and individuals with this mutation experience bleeding episodes after injuries and spontaneous bleeding episodes that often lead to joint disease such as arthritis according to the national hemophilia foundation and the world federation of hemophilia hemophilia b occurs in about one in every  male births with approximately  males currently affected in the us the current standard treatment for individuals with hemophilia is protein replacement of the defective clotting factor with regular infusion of recombinant clotting factors or plasma concentrates these therapies are expensive and sometimes stimulate the body to produce antibodies that inhibit the benefits of treatment the most severe forms of hemophilia b require the need for ongoing preventive infusions about sangamosangamo biosciences inc is focused on engineering genetic cures® for monogenic and infectious diseases by
