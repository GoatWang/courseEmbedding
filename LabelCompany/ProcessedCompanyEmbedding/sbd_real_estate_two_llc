forming an llc for real estate investments pros  cons by jeff weaver esq attorney forming an llc for real estate investments pros  cons by jeff weaver esq january  over the last decade limited liability companies llcs have become one of the most preferred forms of business entities through which to hold title to investment real estate properties llcs did not come into existence in the united states until  when the state of wyoming enacted special legislation to accommodate the needs of oil companies prior to llcs real estate investors seeking limited liability protection were largely limited to using corporations to acquire title—a form of entity that has potential drawbacks florida followed wyomings lead a few years later by enacting its own llc statute in  and now all  states have enacted legislation creating some form of the llc business structure the insulation from personal risk exposure for real estate investors provided by llcs coupled with the relative ease of administration and potential tax benefits make ownership of investment property through an llc a very desirable option in most instances llc vs liability insurance although there are many benefits to holding real property assets through an llc a limited liability company may not be the best holding vehicle for every property owner for many real estate investors the trouble of forming and maintaining a company isnt worth protection from the theoretical threat of a lawsuit particularly when affordable liability insurance is available that said real estate investors that rely solely on insurance as a means of protection from personal liability take a significant risk liability policies typically have limits exceptions and carveouts while the chance of a loss that exceeds policy limits may be remote if it happens the consequences can be devastating under current laws and market trends the popularity of real estate holding llcs is very likely to continue to increase as more and more property owners seek to take advantage of the benefits offered by this form of entity llcs limit personal liability first and foremost llcs limit personal vulnerability to potential lawsuits related to the property consider the situation in which the owner of an investment property leases it to a tenant who decides to throw a big party during which one of the tenants guests falls over a balcony in todays legal climate it is quite possible that the injured guest would pursue a claim based on the “unsafe condition” of the rental dwelling more often than not the owner would be named in any lawsuit resulting from the incident ready to form an llc legalzoom can help get started now if that rental property were owned by a real estate investor individually he or she would be named in the lawsuit and would have to defend his or her personal assets from the plaintiffs claims in contrast if that property were owned by an llc the owners risk exposure would be insulated by the protection of the company leaving only the assets owned by the llc as opposed to all of the owners personal assets exposed to potential lawsuits passthrough taxation for single  multimember llcs another advantage of an llc is the owners ability to enjoy the benefits of passthrough taxation in  the irs released revenue ruling  which declared that wyoming llcs would be taxed as partnerships even though they provide for corporatelike protection against liability c corporations in contrast are subject to double taxation—once at the corporate level and again when dividends are distributed to shareholders while the owners of corporations can achieve passthrough taxation by making an “s” election s corporations are subject to many other restrictions and requirements that limit their utility in the real estate investment realm the  revenue ruling was a true gamechanger because it enabled real estate investors to avoid double taxation by acquiring property through an llc while enjoying a liability shield under the default tax classification rules the irs classifies a real estate holding company with one owner as they would a sole proprietorship namely as a “disregarded entity” as a result income and capital gains from the llc pass through directly to the owner who would only have to pay taxes as an individual while still enjoying the protections offered by the llc liability shield since there is no separate llc tax the owner can avoid double taxation on both the rental income generated by the property and the appreciation in value of the property upon disposition moreover the owner of a singlemember llc can deduct mortgage interest similar to a sole proprietor based on current irs rules real estate holding companies that have several owners are known as “multimember” llcs and are generally taxed by the irs like partnerships meaning that the llc files an “informational” tax return but does not actually pay taxes itself multimember llcs also enjoy the benefits of passthrough taxation as the llc passes its profits and losses through to its members who report their portion of the llcs business income or losses on either a schedule c k or form  with their individual income tax returns this means that both single member and multimember llcs offer the benefits of passthrough taxation of profits and losses and limited liability and personal protection for the owners llcs can make business life easier llcs offer numerous other general benefits relative to other entity forms that arent necessarily unique to—but certainly apply to—the use of llcs to hold real estate investments when delegating management responsibilities llcs enjoy much greater flexibility than either a corporation or partnership while corporations are statutorily required to have officers and directors the llc can be easily managed by its owners or thirdparty managers in the many states that impose increased fees based on the authorized number of shares llcs may pay lower state registration and maintenance fees than corporations owners of llcs can take advantage of the tremendous flexibility in the distribution of profits as determined by the llcs operating agreement cash flow distributions do not have to be pro rata according to ownership like an s corporation which gives the owners the ability to financially reward the “sweat equity” effort of select members through appropriate distributions of available cash flow unlike an s corporation foreign ownership and investment in us real estate is possible through an llc llc owners can also easily transfer their ownership in real estate holdings by proactively gifting the companys membership interests to their heirs each year over time it is entirely possible to effectively pass ownership of real estate owned by an llc to loved ones without ever having to formally execute and record a new deed this enables property owners to avoid transfer and recording taxes and fees which can be substantial in many states although not every company will seek these particular benefits its safe to say that llcs can offer steep rewards to companies that choose to take advantage of them explore your options many business owners choose to form an llc because they are unfamiliar with the many legal nuances between different entity choices and they simply assume that an llc offers the most protection from risk because it has “limited liability” in its name in reality a properly formed and operated llc does indeed limit the personal liability of the owners as much as us law allows by affording the owners no personal risk above and beyond their investment in the company—but in many instances so do corporations and certain partnerships of course if a small business owner of any entity form fails to respect the separate and distinct identity of the business or observe statutorily required corporate formalities such as comingling personal and business funds paying owners instead of creditors or failing to maintain a registered agent the integrity of the corporate shield provided by law will be compromised and potentially expose the owners to personal liability generally speaking though the basic requirements to operate an llc within the confines of the corporate statutes are not particularly onerous minimize risks with the right strategy there is simply no way to eliminate all the risks associated with starting a real estate investment business but you can easily improve your chances of success by complying with the corporate formalities required by applicable laws even though these steps may seem tedious and somewhat confusing if you are in the market for investment real estate you should at least consider whether or not the acquisition through an llc is the right choice for you if so it is much easier to purchase the property through the llc to begin with as opposed to trying to transfer the real estate to an entity at a later date where a lender might have to consent to the transaction an llc may not offer any more or less protection from outside lawsuits than a properly formed and operated corporation or limited liability partnership but it does offer many other advantages that make it the most desirable form of entity in many cases particularly with respect to real estate holding companies if youre considering forming an llc for

richmond next article free investment property pro forma software development investing selling buying about us our philosophy our team  richmond va realtors careers contact us carter snipes december   below is a guest blog post from steven mcdonnough who is a financial consultant that we work with his article clearly outlines the benefits of owning any rental property in an llc many investors don’t put their properties into an llc until they own several properties and for some clients there may be reasons not to but steven makes a good case for the need to do so even for just one property many of our client’s in the richmond virginia area who use snipes properties for property management services aren’t putting their single family rental property into an llc because of the perceived extra cost but i believe anyone with a rental property should consult their cpa  attorney or financial consultant and find out if the benefits outweigh the extra cost what are your thoughts read the article and leave a comment below looking for a good real estate investing software try rehabvaluator and rentalvaluator we recommend it to our clients ———— should i put my rental property in an llc personal v entity owned real estate investment properties investment property is usually defined as real estate that is primarily purchased to buy and sell for a profit in the future or to produce rental income however there are several factors to take into account when deciding to purchase an investment property understanding the many components of investment property ownership can avoid a lot of headaches down the road many investors with real estate investment properties own them personally a more prudent way to own real estate for investment purposes is to transfer ownership to a limited liability company llc this method not only protects it’s ownermember’s personal assets  cash equity in real estate primary residence investment accounts retirement accounts etc – from litigation but it also allows for flexible profit distribution among their members legal benefits the primary reason to form an llc is for the legal protection it offers if the owner has a personal creditor the creditor generally cannot make a claim on the property owned by the llc or other corporate entity should any tenants their guests or anyone on the property sustain any injuries and if the property is owned in the client’s name the owner’s personal assets are at risk example an owner has a rental property that is occupied by a young couple they have a holiday party and one of their guests falls down stairs and is hospitalized the guest sues the owner for his injuries stating the stairs were hazardous if the guest successfully wins the claim against the owner any judgment in excess of the liability insurance can be satisfied with the owner’s personal assets tax benefits from a tax perspective an llc formed with two or more members is classified as a “passthrough” company a “passthrough” means its income is passed through to its owners and claimed on those owners’ individual tax returns hence it is subject only to capital gains rates on the ownership shares of the member and not to corporate capital gains taxes therefore there is no double taxation llcs with just one ownermember however are taxed as a sole proprietorship and no separate tax return is required actual tax dollars saved from holding real estate in an llc opposed to personally holding the properties is zero as of  if you own income property and actively participate in the management of the property and your adjusted gross income is less than  you can write off up to  in rental losses the amount of rental losses that you can write off is proportionately phased out between  and  for example if your adjusted gross income is  you can write off  in rental losses in the year of the loss if your adjusted gross income is  or more you cannot write off any rental losses on your tax return in the year of the loss also remember that although the loss is disallowed for that particular tax year it is not completely lost when you sell your income property you can writeoff

ownership in the property in a more seamless manner than if personally owned in many circumstances property owners wish to gift certain percentages of their real estate to children or other family members for real estate not held in an llc this process can require many trips to the county courthouse to update deeds that will require changes every time percentages of ownership change in cases where real estate is owned in an llc the ownermembers can simply issue membership certificates to the child or family member and no changes need be made to the deed with the county whether you own twenty properties or one owning them personally can be a major liability all of your hard work and planning that lead to the ability to own real estate could be wiped out with one misfortune hopefully

foreclosure what does the llc protect me from thank you november   at  pm reply carter snipes it depends if you signed for the loan personally most banks make borrowers sign a personal guarantee even if the property is titled in an llc november   at  am reply sam as far as i know banks will only give loans to your personally not your llc march   at  pm reply carter snipes lenders will make loans to commercial development groups in the name of the entity these are generally called “nonrecourse loans” because if the project defaults the owners of the business entity or llc are not held financially responsible generally the group has many years of experience deep financial backing and the lender has a sophisticated understanding of the project’s likely success specifically there are hud loans and vhda loans in virginia for large mixedincome multifamily development projects that offer nonrecourse financing community banks will give loans without personally signing to businesses that have operating history long running business credit or dun  bradstreet ratings but they typically we will want collateral nearly equal to the amount of the loan for example equipment inventory or other real estate assets also the sba has a loan program called  specifically for commercial real estate purposes these loans are generally for businesses to buy buildings factories etc but from the standpoint of residential real estate investors you are going to have to personally guarantee any property you get a loan for march   at  am reply denis l if i do not have an llc but i already rented one of my properties is it too late to get an llc… if not what do you suggest… november   at  pm reply carter snipes yes you should be able to put the title into the name of an llc at any time you just need to hire a real estate attorney to change the title and record it for you but if you got the loan in your personal name it will not provide you with any protection from loan default but it can offer some protection in the event that you are sued november   at  am reply denis l i think i will be fine not changing any of the title at the moment because it will incur more expenses at the moment my main goal though is to protect my family and personal assets from any event in which my tenants would attempt to sue me… in this case once i get my llc it will bounce there correct also if i already have a signed contract with my tenants in which reflect my personal name i did this a few months ago how do i go about changing that to an llc do i break the contract and create a new one which type of llc would you recommend if i only have  property for rent sole proprietorship or partnership my wife and i perhaps … thank you very much in advance… you guys are the best november   at  am reply carter snipes your attorney can draft an addendum to the lease that changes the lease to the llc in terms of which type of llc you might want to check with your accountant or attorney that mostly depends on how you file your taxes glad i could help november   at  am reply carina it depends on eatxcly how long ago you purchased your current home fnma fannie mae will acknowledge you purchase of the existing home and in some states it must be over a year ago also most lenders will require a comp rent schedule on the current home as well as you would have to have  equity in your current home in order to use if as a rental home with rental income maybe you can carry both payments i work in the industry and it really is different state by state good luck january   at  am jane mcdonald hi if a husband and wife are on a deed of a building that they now want to put in a llc they are creating and that will both listed as equal members  can they put that building into the llc without changing the deed and incurring the transfer taxes december   at  pm tim pori hello steven if i create an llc naming my self and by brother as owners of an llc for use as as a pass through entity to avoid commingling of funds but do not actually place the properties in the llc will i lose the right to depreciate the property i plan to ask my cpa to prepare the returns for the year and then my brother and i will each be responsible for our share of the taxes because the property is still in my name i plan to reimburse my brother for the depreciation is this possible december   at  pm reply l hanf i have one rental property that i always have a paper loss on however given my income i cannot take it as a loss on my ordianry income and in fact it’s part of my agi that subjects me to amt if i were to create a llc or s corp for that one rental property could that then show as a zero on my  and avoid the impact that is having as part of my agi before deductions and amt january   at  pm reply james stroud hello the article is well written and had plenty of good information over the last  months i have gone from  to  investment properties all in my personal name i probably should have done it earlier but in terms of estate planning and mitigating my risk – i believe i should put them into an llc possibly  my concern is that when i transfer the houses into the llc mortgage companys will be notified via lawyer that the loan may be ‘calledin’ – i need to avoid that the loans were set up as investments properties any thoughts or coments on the likelyhood of the loans being called in regards james january   at  pm reply carter snipes in my experience the lender does not generally call the loan as long as it is current january   at  pm reply thomas phan carter if only if the lender call the loan due when property transferred to the llc what could be an appropriate action for the owner just simple transfer back to owner name to avoid loan due thanks november   at  am reply michael mattera james i would like some advice from you if you care to help out someone starting out currently llc with  property thanks michael matteraandassociatesgmailcom may   at  am reply chuck does moving the property into an llc require a sale and closing if not does it come off of my personal credit report if it is in the llc or is the important point whether i have signed the loan or not thanks january   at  pm reply carter snipes changing the deed and title to the property does require a “closing” but not a “sale” no money needs to change hands a closing attorney just needs to change the title and file it with the court it would not “come off your credit report” in most cases unless you refinance the loan however most lenders require you to personally guarantee a real estate loan so even if you put the property in an llc you are still personally on the loan and it will show up your credit january   at  am reply mary west a friend of mine bought a house in her name for just under  then the  months later put it into her llc company name and has it on the market for  is that all ok to do january   at  pm reply carter snipes it depends if she got a loan for the k or if she paid cash if you buy a property in your personal name and get a loan in your personal name changing the title to an llc does not remove you from the loan january   at  am reply lee i’m buying a multifamily property it’s only four bed units k a lender said the loan terms will be more expensive if i put it in an llc instead of borrowing as the sole proprietor so i obviously want the cheapest terms plus i once had an attorney tell me that if i carried enough insurance then having an llc isn’t necessary for protection your thoughts thanks february   at  pm reply carter snipes if a building is over  units then you have to get commercial financing anyway so the rate change isn’t that big of a deal in those cases when your dealing with single family rentals or multifamily under  units residential rate terms are generally much better and they typically allow for  year amortization which some commercial loan products do not as far as the issue with having enough insurance i’m not  sure but i do know that the idea of having the property in an llc as the article discusses is to shield any personal assets you might have from any risk or liability that the rental property might incur i had a client whose tenant fell off a balcony and was seriously injured now it wasn’t so bad that it maxed out their insurance coverage but i could imagine a situation like that where someone might have died and the lawsuit was greater than the coverage most people get in that kind of situation an llc would have created a potential shield from them coming after your personal assets february   at  pm reply np you mentioned that you still have to personally guarantee the loan even if you transfer the deed given that scenario is very common are you still shielded from liability you mentioned a couple of time above that you were somewhat shielded can you please elaborate february   at  am reply carter snipes i advise everyone to speak with an attorney and an accountant to review their own situation but generally the llc shields the owner from “liability and lawsuits” but not from the debt so if a tenant gets hurt in a property the llc can help to protect the owner’s personal assets from being brought into the lawsuit but an llc does not protect against foreclosure short sale or other defaults of the loan or loan payments february   at  pm reply mike i moved to va over a year ago and rented a house for my family to live in we were unable to sell our house in mn so we rented it out now we are looking to purchase a home in va and i’m wondering if putting my house in mn into an llc will increase my purchasing power on a home in va do mortgage companies treat the rental income and expense differently for investment properties held in an llc february   at  pm reply carter snipes probably not because the lender will probably still make you personally guarantee both loans it would lower your debttoincome ratio to put either property in an llc and give you more purchasing power it just helps to reduce your liability february   at  am reply aisha c great article very informative and helpful thanks for posting february   at  pm reply robert l without going into all the messy details i own one home that i live in and two others that are now rentals the loans on the rentals were originally entered into as primary residence loans if i make a move to put the rentals intoman llc will the banks make me do something like refinance as investment properties and what would that mean to me thanks in advance february   at  pm reply a sirnuri my partner and i purchased an investment property on cash and now we plan to rent it out we have a llc registered in both our names what should be our next steps transfer the deed from our names to llc can we apply for a tax id for the llc or simply what additional things will be needed for tax purposes should we open a joint business account at a bank where all the rent gets deposited in llc’s name any help will be appreciated february   at  pm reply carter snipes you are on the right track yes to all of your questions you should also get a good cpa and attorney as part of your investing team they are critical february   at  am reply lewis c hello i recently bought a rental property with a friend we are both on the loan and have  ownership each it is only a k property would you recommend creating an llc in this case if so what cost should we expect to pay thank you february   at  pm reply carter snipes generally i think having a simple llc when dealing with partners is always the best way to go if gives the protection we have been talking about in this forum in terms of your assets and liability but more importantly the operating agreement of the llc can spell out unforeseen eventualities like what happens if one partner wants to sell and the other doesn’t or what happens if one partner gets divorced or dies do both partners have to agree on all property management and leasing decisions or is one partner tasked with management duties i think in your situation i would be looking for that type of structure for the llc a simple llc filing is usually not terribly expensive to do through your state corporation commission however having the kind of operating agreement like i am suggesting would require a lawyer but it’s probably worth the investment i’ve seen many investment property partnerships experience unforeseen events like i described february   at  am reply as i own a  unit rental property with my personal name i have registered a llc with the state can i rent the apt under the llc do i have to change the insurance policy with llc name as well my bank won’t allow me to change the ownership to llc what are my options please advise thanks february   at  pm reply carter snipes you would need to title the property in the name of your llc if your bank will not allow it then you can’t do it most banks will allow you to title the property in an llc but they require that you are still personally on the loan february   at  pm reply susan l robert l says february   at  pm without going into all the messy details i own one home that i live in and two others that are now rentals the loans on the rentals were originally entered into as primary residence loans if i make a move to put the rentals intoman llc will the banks make me do something like refinance as investment properties and what would that mean to me thanks in advance i am also in this same exact situation and been afraid to notify the bank since my rentals are no longer primary residences to me will i be forced to refinance both properties with a commercial loan march   at  pm reply carter snipes you should discuss with a good local real estate attorney in your area i don’t think the banks would call your loan or make you refinance but i’d speak with an attorney before doing it march   at  pm reply diana robertsusan i am in the same situation i alerted the banks that i am no longer living in those homes due to pcs i had to change my homeowner’s insurance but nothing else changed they will not make you refinance i have bofa and wells fargo mortgages april   at  pm reply scott miller i have one rental property owned by my llc which is mostly a building and home improvement business i was considering changing back to a sole proprietorship because of the expense of my accountant who charges much more to prepare my taxes for the llc since it is more complicated since the building business is slow i haven’t been making the money i used to make and cannot justify paying that bill my wife can do the tax work for a sole proprietorship also i had to evict some tenants due to nonpayment of rent and when i went to court the judge told me i had to be represented by an attorney and i couldn’t represent myself to pay for a lawyer would also be very expensive after reading your article i am thinking twice about going back to having a sole proprietorship mostly because of the legal protection the llc gives what are your thoughts on my situation would it be better for me to be a sole proprietor and just get better insurance march   at  am reply carter snipes many states require that llcs be represented by an attorney in court so yes that is a good point because that can raise your eviction costs if you are self managing your properties also i would not have your business and your rental property in the same llc if your business got sued they could go after your rental property that is the point of having an llc is keeping the assets separate if you only have one property and your business is slow it sounds like the expense of having  llcs is not worth it for you remember its not always worth the expense to have multiple llcs it depends on how much money is at risk in each venture march   at  pm reply rbayer in south carolina i know someone that created a holding company then an llc for his small business owned by the holding company when i asked him about that decision he said he did it because a holding company keeps his name and his social security number private but an llc is public accessible so on the llc for his small business it only shows his fed tax id he is worried about id theft and if he opens another small business that too will be an llc under the holding company now i own a duplex and i’m thinking of getting another

the purchaser is it possible for each of us to legally control our own property even though we wish to keep them under the llc property is in arkansas also what book keeping will the llc entail thanks in advance march   at  am reply carter snipes i can’t give you specific advise about arkansas but i believe you can own multiple properties in the same llc and have more than one member of the llc that has management control an llc does require a different tax filings i’d recommend you get a good local lawyer and cpa on your team to make sure you get the best advice for your state march   at

them when  or more investors are involved in a deal each investor’s profits from the entity simply pass through to their individual tax return scorps require most members to draw salary and pay

sole owner i rent it out to the radio station they do have occasional parties and gatherings my accountant said to just purchase it under my name and not to bother with the llc i do have assets of about  million and want to protect them i have an insurance policy of  million and an umbrella of  million…do you think that is enough to protect me in case of a lawsuit the building is flat with only  stairs on the inside at the back which does limit the risk of falling down the stairs another person i talked to recently said i should have put the deed into an llc what is your opinion january   at  pm reply heather i own a condo that i’m renting and was advised to make it an llc however i’m in the process of refinancing under a harp loan and was wondering if i could still move forward with the llc under this type of loan march   at  pm reply shawn hello everyone question if i transfer my rental properties under my llc do i now need to file that llc in each one of the states as a foreign business entity march   at  pm reply richard so if you have a rental in single owner llc you will have a schedule e on your return do you also need a schedule c  march   at  pm reply helen i own my home plus a  unit  bedroom each complex and  bedroom condos they are all under mine and my husband’s name we have no mortgages on anything i am retired with a pension from my prior employer and have a decent annuity i carry a million dollar umbrella policy for protection i’m debating whether to put the  rental properties under  different llc my accountant has previously said its more complicated and costly for tax preparations but at the same time i pay  annually for the umbrella policy i also have to pay higher premiums on my homeowner’s insurance and the rental dwelling policies in order to carry  of liability required by the umbrella policy i also have to carry  of liability for each of our two autos what’s your opinion on the above should we keep it as we currently have it or switch over to llc’s thank you march   at  pm reply tracy sharpe rather than an llc to protect you against being sued would it be more beneficial to just purchase a  million dollar umbrella policy of course there would be a yearly expense march   at  am reply tony i just read if you made over  you can’t claim income loss but can you claim the rehab march   at  pm reply raj jayanthi what do you suggest for someone who has  rental properties one llc covering all three rental properties or have  different llc’s march   at  pm reply raf hello carter great article so i own one rental property not in llc my husband is not on the deedloan bc i had it bf i was married we now want to buy another rental and form an llc we don’t really want to comingle the properties that we own together with ones we own separately shouldcan i place my single rental in an llc for suit protection and can i even be in another llc with my husband for our joint ventures any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated
