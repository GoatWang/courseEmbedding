subadviser zebra capital management llc zebra seeks to capture a liquidity premium among fundamentally strong publiclytraded equities a liquidity premium exists in public equity markets as more liquid stocks tend to be priced at a premium while less liquid stocks are priced at a discount thus having higher expected returns zebra targets stocks with strong fundamentals ie earnings book value cash flows that trade less than stocks with comparable fundamentals despite producing similar levels of earnings and cash flows these less liquid stocks can often be purchased at lower prices offering higher expected returns frequently a fundamentallysound stock is less traded because it has temporarily fallen out of favor over time the market will recognize this stock again and its price will increase as its trading activity rises allowing zebra to capture its liquidity premium and produce higher returns stocks are typically sold when fundamentals deteriorate trading activity increases

to produce returns distinct from and in addition to traditional investment styles such as value or size investing principal risks market risksmaller company riskthe market values of securities owned by the fund may decline at times sharply and unpredictably due to declines in the overall stock market in general the value of the fund will move in the same direction as the overall stock market which will vary from day to day in response to the activities of individual companies as well as general market regulatory political and economic conditions this risk is generally greater for lower market capitalization companies because they tend to have more limited product lines shorter operating histories less experienced management and more limited financial resources than larger companies stocks of smaller companies may be less liquid than those of larger companies and may experience greater price fluctuations in addition stocks of smaller companies may not be widely followed by the investment community resulting in less demand nonus investment risknonus companies or us companies with significant nonus operations may be subject to risks in addition to those of companies that principally operate in the united states this increased risk is a result of among other things regulatory political social and economic developments abroad different legal regulatory and tax environments less liquidity and greater volatility a lack of uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and increased price volatility value stocks riskvalue stocks are subject to the risk that their intrinsic value may never be realized by the market or that their prices may go down while the funds investments in value stocks may limit its downside risk over time the fund may produce more modest gains than riskier stock funds as a tradeoff for this potentially lower risk liquidity riskfrom time to time certain securities held by the fund may have limited marketability and may be difficult to sell at favorable times or prices it is possible that certain securities held by the fund will not be able to be sold in sufficient amounts or in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by fund shareholders in such event there would be a greater chance that a fund may be forced to curtail or suspend redemptions in which case you might experience a delay or inability to liquidate your investment at the desired time or in the desired amount securities selection risksecurities selected by the subadviser for the fund may not perform to expectations this could result in the funds underperformance compared to other funds with similar investment objectives  pnath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th market eventsglobal turbulence in financial markets and reduced liquidity in credit and fixedincome markets may negatively affect a broad range of issuers which could have an adverse effect on the fund securities lending riskto the extent the fund lends its securities it may be subject to the following risk borrowers of the funds securities typically provide collateral in the form of cash that the fund reinvests in additional securities it is possible that the securities in which the collateral is invested may not perform sufficiently to cover the return collateral payments owed to borrowers in addition delays may occur in the recovery of securities from borrowers which could interfere with the funds ability to vote proxies or to settle transactions inflation riskit is possible that the value of assets or income from investments in the fund will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money investment riskan

part or all of your investment global turbulence in financial markets and reduced liquidity in credit and fixedincome markets may negatively affect a broad range of issuers which could have an adverse effect on the funds therefore before investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when you invest in a fund because of these and other risks you should consider an investment in a fund to be a longterm investment market risk the market values of securities owned by a fund may decline at times sharply and unpredictably due to drops in the stock market in general the value of a fund that invests principally in stocks will move in the same direction as the overall stock market which will vary from day to day in response to the historical and prospective earnings of the issuer the value of its assets management decisions decreased demand for an issuers products or services increased production costs as well as general market regulatory political and economic conditions such as interest rates currency exchange rates investor perceptions and market liquidity under normal conditions the stock markets generally move in cycles over time with periods of rising prices followed by periods of declining prices these fluctuations could be a sustained trend or a drastic movement and the value of your investment may reflect these fluctuations smaller company risk companies with lower market capitalizations may involve greater risk than larger capitalization companies because they tend to have more limited product lines shorter operating histories less experienced management and more limited financial resources than larger companies stocks of smaller companies may be less liquid than those of larger companies and may experience greater price fluctuations in addition stocks of smaller companies may not be widely followed by the investment community resulting in less demand as a result certain securities may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time and the price that a fund would like and consequently a fund may have to lower the price sell other securities instead or forego an investment opportunity any of these potential circumstances if realized could have a negative effect on fund management or performance stylespecific risk the funds emphasize a value style of investing and therefore seek undervalued companies with characteristics for improved valuations the types of companies sought by the fund are subject to the risk that their intrinsic value may never be realized by the market or that their prices may go down it is possible that such companies may remain undervalued for extended periods of time while a funds  pnard page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd investments in value stocks may limit its downside risk over time the fund may produce more modest gains than riskier other stock funds as a tradeoff for this potentially lower risk in addition different types of stocks tend to shift in and

companies organized or headquartered in foreign countries or us companies with significant nonus operations may be subject to risks in addition to those of companies that principally operate in the united states this increased risk is due to potential political social and economic developments abroad different regulatory environments and laws potential seizure by the government of company assets higher taxation withholding taxes on dividends and interest limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets increased price volatility and delays in transaction settlement in some foreign markets other risks include the following o nonus companies may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to us companies and there may be less public information about their operations o enforcing legal rights may be difficult costly and slow in nonus countries and there may be particular problems enforcing claims against nonus governments o changes in currency exchange rates which have increased potential for volatility may affect the value of dividends and interest paid by nonus companies and an increase in the strength of the us dollar relative to these other currencies may cause the value of a fund to decline o nonus markets may be less liquid and more volatile than us markets liquidity risk the funds invest in certain securities that have limited marketability if the economy experiences a sudden downturn it is possible that certain securities held by the fund will not be able to be sold in sufficient amounts or in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by fund shareholders in such event there would be a greater chance that a fund may be forced to curtail or suspend redemptions in which case you might experience a delay or inability to liquidate your investment at the desired time or in the desired amount in addition the valuation of a funds investments may become more difficult if objective market prices are unavailable derivatives risk a derivative refers to any financial investment whose value is derived at least in part from the price of another security or a specified index asset or rate there is different and often greater risk involved when investing in derivatives than the risk associated with investing directly in the underlying securities or index these risks include but are not limited to market risk credit risk leverage risk management risk and liquidity risk adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate can lead to significant losses which may be magnified by certain features of  pnath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the derivatives these risks are heightened when the management team uses derivatives to enhance a funds return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by the fund in addition when a fund invests in certain derivative securities including but not limited to whenissued securities forward commitments futures contracts and interest rate swaps it is effectively leveraging its investments which could result in exaggerated changes in the net asset value of the funds shares and can result in losses that exceed the amount originally invested derivatives can be highly complex and their use within a management strategy can require specialized skills especially when investing in derivatives there can be no assurance that a given strategy will work as planned or provide the return expected the success of the portfolio managers derivatives strategies will depend on its ability to assess and predict the impact of market or economic developments on the underlying asset index or rate and the derivative itself without the benefit of observing the performance of the derivative under all possible market conditions because of their complex nature derivatives may lose liquidity in a volatile market raising the possibility that the fund will not be able to sell them at a sufficient price or in a timely manner gains or losses from positions in a derivative instrument may be much greater than the derivatives original cost small fund risk the funds currently have less assets than larger funds and like other relatively small funds large inflows and outflows may impact a funds market exposure for limited periods of time causing the funds performance to vary from that of the funds model portfolio this impact may be positive or negative depending on the direction of market movement during the period affected the funds do not generally limit large inflows and outflows but it has policies in place which seek to reduce the impact of these flows where

cancelled or revoked by the fund by the next business day following receipt by the fund in enforcing these policies and procedures the trading history of accounts determined to be under common ownership or control within any of the destra funds may be considered as described below however the funds may not be able to identify all instances of excessive trading or completely eliminate the possibility of excessive trading in particular it may be difficult to identify excessive trading in certain omnibus accounts and other accounts traded through intermediaries by their nature omnibus accounts in which purchases and redemptions of the funds shares by multiple investors are aggregated by the intermediary and presented to the funds on a net basis may effectively conceal the identity of individual investors and their transactions from the funds and their agents this makes the elimination of excessive trading in the accounts impractical without the assistance of the intermediary among other safeguards the funds attempt to deter excessive trading through the following methods o exchange limitations as described under exchanges o trade monitoring o fair valuation of securities as described under pricing of fund shares and o redemption fees as described under redemption fee where applicable on certain classes of the funds generally a purchase and redemption of shares from the same fund within  calendar days a round trip may result in enforcement of a funds excessive trading policies and procedures with respect to future purchase orders provided that each fund reserves the right to reject any purchase request as explained above the funds constantly monitor for patterns of shareholder frequent trading any investor who makes more than one round trip in a fund over a day period may be subject to  pnath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th suspension or termination of such investors exchange privileges the fund may also bar future purchases into the fund and other destra funds by such investor the funds excessive trading policies generally do not apply to i a money market fund although money market funds at all times reserve the right to reject any purchase request including exchange purchases for any reason without prior notice and ii transactions in the destra funds by a destra fund of funds which is a fund that primarily invests in other destra mutual funds the funds trustees may approve from time to time a redemption fee to be imposed by any destra fund subject to  days notice to shareholders of that fund omnibus transactions placed through a financial intermediary for numerous investors may cause such investors to be treated as a group for purposes of the funds excessive trading policies and procedures and may be rejected in whole or in part by a fund the funds however cannot always identify or reasonably detect excessive trading that may be facilitated by financial intermediaries or made difficult to identify through the use of omnibus accounts because certain intermediaries transmit purchase exchange and redemption orders to the funds as a net aggregation of numerous investor orders the funds may have difficulty curtailing such activity transactions accepted by a financial intermediary in violation of the funds excessive trading policies may be cancelled or revoked by a fund by the next business day following receipt by that fund in an attempt to detect and deter excessive trading in omnibus accounts the funds or their agents may require intermediaries to impose restrictions on the trading activity of accounts traded through those intermediaries such restrictions may include but are not limited to requiring that trades be placed by us mail prohibiting future purchases by investors who have recently redeemed fund shares requiring intermediaries to report information about customers who purchase and redeem large amounts and other similar restrictions the funds ability to impose such restrictions with respect to accounts traded through particular intermediaries may vary depending on the systems capabilities applicable contractual and legal restrictions and cooperation of those intermediaries certain transactions in fund shares such as periodic rebalancing through intermediaries no more frequently than every  days or those which are made pursuant to systematic purchase exchange or redemption programs generally do not raise excessive trading concerns and normally do not require application of the funds methods to detect and deter excessive trading each fund also reserves the right to reject any purchase request including exchange purchases by any investor or group of investors for any reason without prior notice including in particular if the trading activity in the accounts is deemed to be disruptive to a fund for example a fund may refuse a purchase order if the funds portfolio managers andor investment personnel believe they would be unable to invest the money effectively in accordance with the funds investment policies or the fund would otherwise be adversely affected due to the size of the transaction frequency of trading or other factors  pnath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the funds policies and procedures regarding excessive trading may be modified at any time by the funds trustees excessive trading risks excessive trading may present risks to a funds longterm shareholders and investment objectives excessive trading into and out of a fund may disrupt portfolio investment strategies may create taxable gains to remaining fund shareholders and may increase fund expenses all of which may negatively impact investment returns for all remaining shareholders funds that invest in foreign securities may be at a greater risk for excessive trading investors may attempt to take advantage of anticipated price movements in securities held by a fund based on events occurring after the close of a foreign market that may not be reflected in the funds nav referred to as price arbitrage such arbitrage opportunities may also arise in funds which do not invest in foreign securities for example when trading in a security held by a fund is halted and does not resume prior to the time the fund calculates its nav referred to as stale pricing funds that hold thinlytraded securities such as certain smallcapitalization securities may be subject to attempted use of arbitrage techniques to the extent that a funds valuation of a security differs from the securitys market value shortterm arbitrage traders may dilute the nav of a fund which negatively impacts longterm shareholders although the funds have adopted fair valuation policies and procedures intended to reduce the funds exposure to price arbitrage stale pricing and other potential pricing inefficiencies under such circumstances there is potential for shortterm arbitrage trades to dilute the value of fund shares although the funds take steps to detect and deter excessive trading pursuant to the policies and procedures described in this prospectus and approved by the trustees there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in limiting excessive trading in all circumstances for example the funds may be unable to completely eliminate the possibility of excessive trading in certain omnibus accounts and other accounts traded through intermediaries omnibus accounts may effectively conceal the identity of individual investors and their transactions from the funds and their agents this makes the funds identification of excessive trading transactions in the funds through an omnibus account difficult and makes the elimination of excessive trading in the account impractical without the assistance of the intermediary although the funds encourage intermediaries to take necessary actions to detect and deter excessive trading some intermediaries may be unable or unwilling to do so and accordingly the funds cannot eliminate completely the possibility of excessive trading shareholders that invest through an omnibus account should be aware that they may be subject to the policies and procedures of their financial

except where indicated otherwise also implement the following strategies equity securities under normal market conditions each funds invests primarily in equity securities which include common stocks and other securities with equity characteristics common stocks represent units of ownership in a company and typically have voting rights and earn dividends dividends on common stocks are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of a companys board equity securities may also include equity securities of investment companies and exchangetraded funds general risks of investing in stocks while investing in stocks allows shareholders to participate in the benefits of owning a company such shareholders must accept the risks of ownership unlike bondholders who have preference to a companys earnings and cash flow preferred stockholders followed by common stockholders in order of priority are entitled only to the residual amount after a company meets its other obligations for this reason the value of a companys stock will usually react more strongly to actual or perceived changes in the companys financial condition or prospects than its debt obligations stockholders of a company that fares poorly can lose money stock markets tend to move in cycles with short or extended periods of rising and falling stock prices the value of a companys stock may fall because of o factors that directly relate to that company such as decisions made by its management or lower demand for the companys products or services o factors affecting an entire industry such as increases in production costs and o changes in financial market conditions that are relatively unrelated to the company or its industry such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates or inflation rates because preferred securities are generally junior to debt securities and other obligations of the issuer deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer will cause greater changes in the value of a preferred security than in a more senior debt security with similar stated yield characteristics the fund may invest in securities of issuers with small or medium market capitalizations any investment in small and medium capitalization companies involves greater risk and price volatility than that customarily associated with investments in larger more established companies this increased risk may be due to the greater business risks of their small or medium size limited markets and financial resources narrow product lines and frequent lack of management depth the securities of small and medium capitalization companies are often  pnath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th traded in the overthecounter market and might not be traded in volumes typical of securities traded on a national securities exchange thus the securities of small and medium capitalization companies are likely to be less liquid and subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than securities of larger more established companies nonus securities the funds may invest in a variety of securities issued by nonus companies investments in nonus securities involve risks in addition to the usual risks inherent in domestic investments including currency risk the value of a nonus security in us dollars tends to decrease when the value of the us dollar rises against the nonus currency in which the security is denominated and tends to increase when the value of the us dollar falls against such currency nonus securities are affected by the fact that in many countries there is less publicly available information about issuers than is available in the reports and ratings published about companies in the united states and companies may not be subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards other risks inherent in nonus investments include expropriation confiscatory taxation withholding taxes on dividends and interest less extensive regulation of nonus brokers securities markets and issuers diplomatic developments and political or social instability nonus economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in various respects and many nonus securities are less liquid and their prices tend to be more volatile than comparable us securities from time to time nonus securities may be difficult to liquidate rapidly without adverse price effects the funds may also invest in nonus securities by purchasing depositary receipts denominated in us dollars including american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs or other securities representing indirect ownership interests in the securities of nonus companies including new york shares generally adrs in registered form are denominated in us dollars and are designated for use in the us securities markets while edrs and gdrs are typically in bearer form and may be denominated in nonus currencies and are designed for use in european and other markets adrs are receipts typically issued by a us bank or trust company evidencing ownership of the underlying nonus security adrs edrs and gdrs are deemed to have the same classification as the underlying securities they represent except that adrs edrs and gdrs shall be treated as indirect nonus investments thus an adr edr or gdr representing ownership of common stock will be treated as common stock adrs edrs and gdrs do not eliminate all of the risks associated with directly investing in the securities of nonus companies such as changes in nonus currency exchange rates however by investing in adrs rather than directly in nonus companies stock a fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period some adrs may not be sponsored by the issuer other types of depositary receipts include american depositary shares adss global depositary certificates gdcs and international depositary receipts idrs adss are shares issued under a deposit agreement representing the underlying ordinary shares that trade in the issuers home market an adr described above is a certificate that represents a number of  pnath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th adss gdcs and idrs are typically issued by a nonus bank or trust company although they may sometimes also be issued by a us bank or trust company gdcs and idrs are depositary receipts that evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a nonus or a us corporation depositary receipts may be available through sponsored or unsponsored facilities a sponsored facility is established jointly by a depositary and the issuer of the security underlying the receipt an unsponsored facility may be established by a depositary without participation by the issuer of the security underlying the receipt there are greater risks associated with holding unsponsored depositary receipts for example if a fund holds an unsponsored depositary receipt it will generally bear all of the costs of establishing the unsponsored facility in addition the depositary of an unsponsored facility frequently is under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security whether a sponsored or unsponsored facility there is no assurance that either would pass through to the holders of the receipts voting rights with respect to the deposited securities in considering whether to invest in the securities of a nonus company the portfolio managers consider such factors as the characteristics of the particular company differences between economic trends and the performance of securities markets within the united states and those within other countries the portfolio managers also consider factors relating to the general economic governmental and social conditions of the country or countries where the company is located securities transactions conducted outside the united states may not be regulated as rigorously as in the united states may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of nonus securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex nonus political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the united states of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in a funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in nonus markets during nonbusiness hours in the united states iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and the margin requirements than in the united states v currency exchange rate changes and vi lower trading volume and liquidity currency risk by investing in nonus securities a fund will be subject to currency risk which is the risk that an increase in the us dollar relative to the nonus currency will reduce returns or portfolio value generally when the us dollar rises in value relative to a nonus currency a funds investment in securities denominated in that currency will lose value because its currency is worth fewer us dollars on the other hand when the value of the us dollar falls relative to a nonus currency a funds investments denominated in that currency will tend to increase in value because that currency is worth more us dollars the exchange rates between the us dollar and nonus currencies depend upon such factors as supply and demand in the currency exchange markets international balance of payments governmental intervention speculation and other economic and political conditions although a fund values its assets daily in us dollars the fund may not convert its holdings of nonus currencies to us dollars on a daily basis a fund may incur conversion costs when it converts  pnast page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st its holdings to another currency nonus exchange dealers may realize a profit on the difference between the price at which a fund buys and sells currencies each fund may engage in nonus currency exchange transactions in connection with its portfolio investments a fund conducts its nonus currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the nonus currency exchange market or through forward contracts to purchase or sell nonus contracts dollar rolls whenissued

commitment to purchase or sell is made but delivery and payment for the whenissued securities takes place at a later date normally one to two months after the date of purchase during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the purchaser to the issuer and no interest accrues to the purchaser such transactions therefore involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines prior to the settlement date or if the value of the security to be sold increases prior to the settlement date a sale of a whenissued security also involves the risk that the other party will be unable to settle the transaction a dollar roll is a contract to sell mortgagebacked securities as collateral against a commitment to repurchase similar but not identical

with its custodian a segregated account containing highgrade liquid securities in an amount at least equal to the forward purchase obligation dollar rolls are a type of forward commitment transaction purchases and sales of securities on a forward commitment basis involve a commitment to purchase or sell securities with payment and delivery to take place at some future date normally one to two months after the date of the transaction as with whenissued securities these transactions involve certain risks but they also enable an investor to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates and prices forward commitment transactions are executed for existing obligations whereas in a whenissued transaction the obligations have not yet been issued when purchasing securities on a whenissued or forward commitment basis a segregated account of liquid assets at least equal to the value of purchase commitments for such securities will be maintained until the settlement date other investment

advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax professional fund status the funds intend to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if a fund qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the fund generally will not pay federal income taxes qualification as a regulated investment company as a regulated

represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from a fund is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions

the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from a fund may also be subject to a new  percent medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns shares generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from a fund because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on shares that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by a fund from certain corporations may be designated by the fund as being eligible for the dividends received deduction if you sell or redeem shares if you sell or redeem your shares you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your shares from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your shares is generally equal to the cost of your shares generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your shares taxation of capital gains and losses if you are an individual

capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your shares to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from a fund and sell your share at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income in addition the code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations taxation of certain ordinary income dividends ordinary income dividends received by an individual shareholder from a regulated investment company such as a fund are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to  pnath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th qualifying dividends

distributions under certain circumstances as described in the prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of fund securities when you redeem shares or when a fund terminates this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss may not be currently deducted exchanges if you exchange shares of your fund for shares of another destra fund the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of fund expenses expenses incurred and deducted by a fund will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however

as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income nonus tax credit if a fund invests in any nonus securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing nonus taxes the fund paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes the fund

foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the fund could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its shareholders a fund will not be able to pass through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes a fund may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the fund would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the fund might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the
