menuclose menu careers contact us login    a chief investment officer cio is an experienced investment professional that is normally supported by a fullystaffed investment department and is pointaccountable for the investment success of an entire investment program  not just stocks or bonds or money market funds or hedge funds or venture capital or commodities but all investments across the entire program having a qualified chief investment officer supported by a fullycapable staff provides a fundamental advantage in terms of both managing risk and achieving netofallfee returns whether the cio is a fulltime employee of one’s family or institution or an outsourced cio ocio the professional and moral contract between cio and client is the same the cio and firm must have the skill experience and resources to evaluate and manage assets across every asset class and return source and must be unencumbered by the conflictsofinterest that have plagued the investment industry for far too long the most sophisticated investment programs implement component solutions by allocating capital to independent specialist money managers this “open architecture” enables investors to use any specialist manager anywhere in the world and reduces conflictsofinterest not only does a chief investment officer have the critical task of allocating capital with insight skill and discipline to control risk and enhance program return but also just as important is allocating that capital in a manner that responds to the family or institution’s particular fact pattern  financial risk operating risk liquidity requirements and constituency risk as the first firm to offer outsourced cio services to serious investors who chose not to develop and pay for an internal department hirtle
