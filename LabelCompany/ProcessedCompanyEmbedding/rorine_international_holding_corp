condition of our business these forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things   • general economic and business conditions both nationally and in our markets   •  our expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance financing plans and the impact of competition   •  our ability to implement our growth strategy • anticipated trends in our business   •  advances in technologies and   •  other risk factors set forth herein   in addition in this report we use words such as anticipates believes plans expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements   as used in this current report the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to rorine international holding corporation   we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise after the date of this annual report on form k in light of these risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forwardlooking statements   item  business   history   our company was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   from incorporation until  we were a distributor of an electronic noninvasive acupuncture pen as an alternative to traditional needles used during acupuncture treatments we did not generate revenues from sale of the acupuncture pen and upon further market research it was determined that pursuing the marketing and sale of this product was not as profitable as previously projected therefore all efforts relating to the distribution and marketing of the acupuncture pen ceased  in  the company entered the business of marketing certain energy conversion and waste disposal pyrolysis technology and systems   this business was discontinued by march    previous business   on october   we completed the incorporation and registration of unwall technologies holdings sdnbhd a whollyowned malaysian subsidiary “unwall technologies” which commenced operations to offer mobile apps through its former website wwwuwiiorg   the company planned to introduce applications for mobile devices in the first half of  and web applications later in the year this venture was discontinued may   and the business closed by august   the subsidiary does still exist with no assets or liabilities remaining        development began on a web based social lending division so far this business has not proceeded beyond initial plans for a joint venture and as a result the company has reverted to shell company status   on january   we announced a marketing and distribution agreement with rich group concerning the marketing of eastern alternative medical packages related to type ii diabetes outside china to nontraditional markets where permitted by applicable law on july   we changed our corporate name to “ shine technologies inc” and on september   we again changed our corporate name this time to our present corporate name “rorine international holding corporation”  both of these corporation name changes were accomplished by means of a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary as permitted by nevada corporation law current business on the  january  rorine international holding corporation inc entered in a marketing and distribution agreement with rich group based in south east asia the agreement was negotiated and announced by rorine’s chief financial officer mr tan sew according to mr tan this agreement took several months to plan and negotiate and “will give rorine an excellent opportunity to market eastern alternative medical packages related to type ii diabetes outside of china to nontraditional markets such as in the west”   the agreement was signed between rorine international holding corporation and rich group who had previously acquired guangzhou huanai nutrition and health information co ltd and guangzhou tongde hospital one of rich group’s diversified investment holdings has been in alternative medicine  treatment for type ii diabetes specifically in china where roughly  of the population is susceptible to it they have a noninvasive treatment program based on the combination of traditional chinese medicine and modern hyperthermia elemental balance therapy psychotherapy resulting in complete restoration to normal health and diet they currently have a separate marketing and distribution company specifically for the china market this new agreement allows them to move outside of china into new and growing markets specifically targeting western patients   according to this agreement rorine will setup and prepare a marketing strategy and platform as well as liaise with hospitals clinics and associations in order to bring this unique product to markets in the west where diabetes is also on the rise   the agreement is part of a long term strategy initiated by the board of directors of rorine international holding corporation faithfully guided by its chief officer mr tesheb casimir part of this turn around occurred when the board decided to appoint mr tan sew as its cfo in late  mr tan has been involved in new project finance and development in south east asia for the past  years   we have not been involved in any bankruptcy receivership or similar    proceeding   item a risk factors   any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or operating   results   all parties and individuals reviewing this annual report on form k and considering us as an investment should be aware of the financial risk involved when deciding whether to invest or not careful review of the risk factors set forth herein and consideration of forwardlooking statements contained in this registration statement should be adhered to prospective investors should be aware of the difficulties encountered as we face all the risks including competition and the need for additional working capital the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems and expenses that are frequently encountered in connection with operations in the competitive environment in which we will be operating   you should read the following risk factors carefully before purchasing our common stock           the company likely will require continuing financial support from its officers directors or principal stockholder to sustain operations but such support is not assured   the company’s planned business will require significant cash advances from its officers directors or principal stockholder to pay operating expenses general and administrative costs and the substantial fees and expenses of the company being a public company these advances will be booked as debt owed to the officers directors or principal stockholder and the company may issue stock in payment of the advances   although making such advances would be in the interest of our officers directors and principal stockholder they are not required to do so and have not funded a credit line or other facility to ensure the company’s access to capital as needed   the company will rely on its two directors to manage the company and their decisions may present potential conflicts of interest   tesheb casimir and tan sew hock are our only officers and directors all stockholders will have to rely solely on their judgment as to how best manage the company and develop and grow  the business of rorine    our common stock represents an illiquid investment and there are risks associated with investing in companies trading on the overthecounter bulletin board   although the company’s common stock is quoted on otcmarkets for over  months trading has been sporadic and low volume we cannot be certain that a sufficiently active market will develop to allow you to sell your shares accordingly a purchase of the shares must be considered a long term investment and only for investors who can tolerate the loss of their entire investment  in addition to the risks of investing in our stock there are separate risks associated with investing in and trading the stock of companies through otcmarkets   including   · absence of listing standards companies listed on nasdaq or national stock exchanges have to maintain strict standards of corporate governance a majority of independent directors and audit compensation and nominating committees comprised of independent directors a minimum stock   price and various matters which have to be approved by shareholders otcmarkets traded companies are not subject to such standards · inefficient trading and lower liquidity stockholders of otcmarkets companies frequently have difficulty in getting buysell orders filled promptly andor at expected prices · lower trading volume though some otcmarkets companies experience occasional periods of heavy trading many otcmarkets companies have lower trading volume which contributes to the illiquidity of investing in such companies the otcmarkets is separate and distinct from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the otc bulletin board the sec’s order handling rules which apply to nasdaqlisted securities do not apply to securities quoted on    otcmarkets although the nasdaq stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards otcmarkets has no listing standards rather it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system files the application and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files finra cannot deny an application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because our stock trades on otcmarkets rather than on nasdaq investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed trading activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with nasdaqlisted securities investors must contact a brokerdealer to trade otcmarkets securities investors do not have direct access to the otcmarkets service and there only has to be one market maker          because otcmarkets stocks are usually not followed by analysts there may be lower trading volume than for nasdaqlisted   securities because we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock it is extremely unlikely that the company will have positive earnings in the future and it is unlikely that a reverse merger with an operating company will result in earnings sufficient to pay dividends it is much more likely that such future earnings would be retained to finance the business in any event payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of the future board of directors following a reverse merger taking into account the merged companies’ revenues financial condition operating results cash needs growth plans and other factors accordingly investors that are seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock because we will be subject to the “penny stock” rules once our shares are quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the sec penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted on nasdaq the penny stock rules require  a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker  the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction consequently these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares       risks related to doing business in malaysia malaysia suffers from endemic corruption our discontinued unwall technologies business was focused in malaysia it is possible that our healthcare products marketing business may also target the malaysian market there have been numerous highprofile corruption cases allegedly marketbased principles are not applied in cases involving individuals with high – level political access it is alleged that malaysian business executives rank corruption as one of the most problematic factors for doing business in malaysia  the government has recognized the problem and promised to curb corruption but the results have so far not met expectations  as a united states company the company is subject to united states laws making it illegal to pay bribes to foreign officials which may make the company less competitive in winning business in malaysia in competition with nonunited states companies malaysia suffers from political favoritism and a judiciary that is allegedly not    independent it has been alleged that in public procurement there is local favoritism which is fostered by a secretive procurement procedure there is allegedly also preference for businesses owned by “bumiputera” which are ethnic malays and other malaysian indigenous peoples additionally the judiciary is reportedly not independent and there have been alleged instances of selective prosecution preferential treatment and arbitrarily or politically motivated verdicts  any of these factors could disfavor an american company such as rorine        risks related to doing business in i ndonesia our discontinued unwall technologies business also focused on indonesia it is possible that our planned healthcare products marketing business may also target the indonesian market reported risks of doing business in indonesia are similar to malaysia but allegedly much worse with the country historically reported to be riddled with endemic corruption again to the extent that these reports are true the company could be very seriously disadvantaged as an american company prohibited by law from bribing foreign officials risks related to doing business in china certain important certificates permits and licenses are subject to prc governmental control and renewal and the failure to obtain renewal would adversely impact our  business it is possible that we will also target the healthcare products marketing business in the peoples republic of china prc as well as in indonesia and malaysia  doing business in the prc is subject to compliance with numerous permits and licenses licenses and permits must be complied with and renewed periodically during the application or renewal process businesses will be evaluated and reevaluated by the appropriate governmental authorities and must comply with the prevailing standards and regulations which may change from time to time in the event that the company with which were merger is not able to obtain or renew the certificates permits and licenses all or part of the combined companies’ prc operations may be suspended by the government which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition furthermore if escalating compliance costs associated with governmental standards and regulations restrict or prohibit any part of the operations it may adversely affect our results of operations and  profitability uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us any prc operations generally will be subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign invested enterprises in china the prc legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value since  a series of new prc laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to intellectual property rights and various forms of foreign investments in china however since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the prc legal system continues to rapidly evolve the interpretations of many laws regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws regulations and rules involve uncertainties which may limit legal protections available to you and us in addition any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention since any future assets of the company will likely be located outside the united states it will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against the company and our officers directors and assets based in   china while the company presently has no assets a full impairment having been taken upon discontinuation of our unwall technologies business it is possible that our planned healthcare products marketing business will acquire assets  although the company is a nevada corporation our officers and directors reside outside of the united states and all our assets will likely be located outside the united states  as a result it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states  upon the directors or officers or enforce against any of them court judgments obtained in united states’ courts including judgments relating to united states federal securities laws in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the prc or hong kong would recognize or enforce judgments of united states’ courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or have jurisdiction to hear original actions brought in the united states predicated upon the securities laws of the united states furthermore it would be extremely difficult to access those assets to satisfy an award entered against us in united states courts        item b unresolved staff comments none item  properties principal business office our principal business office is a shared office services facility

below and elsewhere in this report particularly in the section entitled “risk  factors” our financial statements are stated in united states dollars and are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting   principles o verview critical  accounting  estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment the resulting accounting estimates will not always precisely equal the related actual results management considers an accounting estimate to be critical  if   assumptions are required to be made and   changes in estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements we have determined that none of the estimates meet those criteria of a significant  estimate cash requirements over the next twelve months we intend to use any funds that we may have available to fund our operations not accounting for our working capital deficiency of  as of november   we require additional funds of approximately  to cover ongoing general and administrative expenses as a public company as well as minimal initial expenses for our planned healthcare products marketing business we do not have the funds necessary to cover our projected operating expenses for the next twelve month period we will be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities through loans or through debt financing there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the required capital or that actual cash requirements will not exceed our estimates we intend to fulfill any additional cash requirement through private placement of debt or equity to our existing shareholders        our auditors have issued a going concern opinion for our year ended november   this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills as we had no cash on hand and a working capital deficiency in the amount of  as of november   we do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months we plan to complete debt financings andor private placement sales of our common stock in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operation and to fund our working capital deficit in order to enable us to pay our accounts payable and accrued liabilities we currently do not have any

enterprise was initiated with the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary unwall technologies holdings sdn ghd technologies a malaysian corporation incorporated on july    the company plans to introduce applications for mobile devices in the first half of  and web applications later in the year  the company is considered a development stage entity because this new business enterprise is in the process of platform development and has not derived significant revenue from operations in november  the company name was changed to unwall international inc  these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in operation the company’s present plans the realization of which cannot be assured are to raise necessary funds through shareholder loans

controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the securities exchange act of   as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer who is acting as our principal executive officer principal financial officer and principle accounting officer to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of november   the end of the fiscal period covered by this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision of our chief executive officer with the participation of our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures the officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report management’s report on internal control over financial   reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting responsibility estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures the objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed in accordance with management’s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of november   in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework our management has concluded that as of november   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective this annual report does not include an attestation report of our company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by our company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit our company to provide only management’s report in this annual   report inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance interpretation of existing andor changing rules and principles segregation of management duties scale of organization and personnel factors internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate          material weakness in internal control over financial reporting     subsequent to november   management reassessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on this evaluation the company’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer identified a material weakness related in the company’s internal control over financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the company failed to design controls adequate to insure that all stock issuance during a particular reporting period were reflected in the financial statements and disclosures for that period     based on this assessment and the material weakness described above management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of november   and had not been remediated by the end of the period covered by this annual report on form k however the company has concluded that the existence of this material weakness did not result in a material misstatement of the company’s financial statements included in this annual report on form k       remediation measures    to address the material weakness described above the company has designed and implemented new and enhanced controls to ensure that all stock issuances during a particular reporting period are reflected in the financial statements and disclosures for that period    we believe the actions described above will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting however the new and enhanced controls have not operated for a sufficient amount of time to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate   changes in internal control over financial reporting   other than as set forth above there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this annual report on form k that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control

pronouncements the company has analyzed the relevant accounting standards updates and has determined that none are anticipated to have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations      item         quantitative and qualitative disclosures about marketrisk we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the securities exchange act of  and are not required to provide the information under this item    item         controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by exchange act rule ab as of the end of the period covered by this report  based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures during such period were not effective there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended august   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting material weakness in internal control over financial reporting   subsequent to the evaluation made in connection with the filing of the form q on october   management reassessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on this evaluation the company’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer identified a material weakness related in the company’s internal control over financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the company failed to design controls adequate to insure that all stock issuance during a particular reporting period were reflected in the financial statements and disclosures for that period   based on this assessment and the material weakness described above management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of november   and had not been remediated by the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q however the company has concluded that the existence of this material weakness did not result in a material misstatement of the company’s financial statements included in its annual report on form k for the year ended november   as initially filed on march   or in its quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended february   or may   as initially filed on august   and october   respectively   remediation measures   to address the material weakness described above the company has designed and implemented new and enhanced controls to ensure that all stock issuances during a particular reporting period are reflected in the financial statements and disclosures for that period   we believe the actions described above will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting however the new and enhanced controls have not operated for a sufficient amount of time to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate   changes in internal control over financial reporting   other than as set forth above there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report on form q that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting     part ii other information item a     risk factors we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the securities exchange act of  and are not required to provide the

statement schedules  signatures           part i   note regarding forwardlooking statements   this report contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  the exchange act we have based these forwardlooking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition of our business these forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things   • general economic and business conditions both nationally and in our markets   •  our expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance financing plans and the impact of competition   •  our ability to implement our growth strategy • anticipated trends in our business   •  advances in technologies and   •  other risk factors set forth herein   in addition in this report we use words such as anticipates believes plans expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements   as used in this current report the terms “we” “us” “our” and the “company” refer to rorine international holding corporation   we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise after the date of this annual report on form k in light of these risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forwardlooking statements   item  business   history   our company was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   from incorporation until  we were a distributor of an electronic noninvasive acupuncture pen as an alternative to traditional needles used during acupuncture treatments we did not generate revenues from sale of the acupuncture pen and upon further market research it was determined that pursuing the marketing and sale of this product was not as profitable as previously projected therefore all efforts relating to the distribution and marketing of the acupuncture pen ceased  in  the company entered the business of marketing certain energy conversion and waste disposal pyrolysis technology and systems   this business was discontinued by march    current business   on october   we completed the incorporation and registration of unwall technologies holdings sdnbhd a whollyowned malaysian subsidiary “unwall technologies” which commenced operations to offer mobile apps through its former website wwwuwiiorg  the company planned to introduce applications for mobile devices in the first half of  and web applications later in the year this venture was discontinued may   and the business closed by august   the subsidiary does still exist with no assets or liabilities remaining        development began on a web based social lending division so far this business has not proceeded beyond initial plans for a joint venture and as a result the company has reverted to shell company status   on january   we announced a marketing and distribution agreement with rich group concerning the marketing of eastern alternative medical packages related to type ii diabetes outside china to nontraditional markets where permitted by applicable law on july   we changed our corporate name to “ shine technologies inc” and on september   we again changed our corporate name this time to our present corporate name “rorine international holding corporation”  both of these corporation name changes were accomplished by means of a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary as permitted by nevada corporation law   we have not been involved in any bankruptcy receivership or similar    proceeding   item a risk factors   any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or operating   results   all parties and individuals reviewing this annual report on form k and considering us as an investment should be aware of the financial risk involved when deciding whether to invest or not careful review of the risk factors set forth herein and consideration of forwardlooking statements contained in this registration statement should be adhered to prospective investors should be aware of the difficulties encountered as we face all the risks including competition and the need for additional working capital the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems and expenses that are frequently encountered in connection with operations in the competitive environment in which we will be operating   you should read the following risk factors carefully before purchasing our common stock    the company likely will require continuing financial support from its officers directors or principal stockholder to sustain operations but such support is not assured   the company’s planned business will require significant cash advances from its officers directors or principal stockholder to pay operating expenses general and administrative costs and the substantial fees and expenses of the company being a public company these advances will be booked as debt owed to the officers directors or principal stockholder and the company may issue stock in payment of the advances   although making such advances would be in the interest of our officers directors and principal stockholder they are not required to do so and have not funded a credit line or other facility to ensure the company’s access to capital as needed   the company will rely on its two directors to manage the company and their decisions may present potential conflicts of interest   tesheb casimir and tan sew hock are our only officers and directors all stockholders will have to rely solely on their judgment as to how best manage the company and develop and grow  the business of rorine    our common stock represents an illiquid investment and there are risks associated with investing in companies trading on the overthecounter bulletin board   although the company’s common stock is quoted on otcmarkets for over  months trading has been sporadic and low volume we cannot be certain that a sufficiently active market will develop to allow you to sell your shares accordingly a purchase of the shares must be considered a long term investment and only for investors who can tolerate the loss of their entire investment  in addition to the risks of investing in our stock there are separate risks associated with investing in and trading the stock of companies through otcmarkets   including     ·  absence of listing standards companies listed on nasdaq or national stock exchanges have to maintain strict standards of corporate governance a majority of independent directors and audit compensation and nominating committees comprised of independent directors a minimum stock   price and various matters which have to be approved by shareholders otcmarkets traded companies are not subject to such standards          ·  inefficient trading and lower liquidity stockholders of otcmarkets companies frequently have difficulty in getting buysell orders filled promptly andor at expected prices     ·  lower trading volume though some otcmarkets companies experience occasional periods of heavy trading many otcmarkets companies have lower trading volume which contributes to the illiquidity of investing in such companies   the otcmarkets is separate and distinct from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the otc bulletin board the sec’s order handling rules which apply to nasdaqlisted securities do not apply to securities quoted on    otcmarkets   although the nasdaq stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards otcmarkets has no listing standards rather it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system files the application and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files finra cannot deny an application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because our stock trades on otcmarkets rather than on nasdaq investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed trading activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with nasdaqlisted securities investors must contact a brokerdealer to trade otcmarkets securities investors do not have direct access to the otcmarkets service and there only has to be one market maker   because otcmarkets stocks are usually not followed by analysts there may be lower trading volume than for nasdaqlisted   securities    because we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock   it is extremely unlikely that the company will have positive earnings in the future and it is unlikely that a reverse merger with an operating company will result in earnings sufficient to pay dividends it is much more likely that such future earnings would be retained to finance the business in any event payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of the future board of directors following a reverse merger taking into account the merged companies’ revenues financial condition operating results cash needs growth plans and other factors accordingly investors that are seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock   because we will be subject to the “penny stock” rules once our shares are quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced   brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the sec penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted on nasdaq the penny stock rules require  a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker  the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction consequently these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares         risks related to doing business in malaysia   malaysia suffers from endemic corruption   our discontinued unwall technologies business was focused in malaysia it is possible that our healthcare products marketing business may also target the malaysian market there have been numerous highprofile corruption cases allegedly marketbased principles are not applied in cases involving individuals with high – level political access it is alleged that malaysian business executives rank corruption as one of the most problematic factors for doing business in malaysia  the government has recognized the problem and promised to curb corruption but the results have so far not met expectations  as a united states company the company is subject to united states laws making it illegal to pay bribes to foreign officials which may make the company less competitive in winning business in malaysia in competition with nonunited states companies   malaysia suffers from political favoritism and a judiciary that is allegedly not    independent   it has been alleged that in public procurement there is local favoritism which is fostered by a secretive procurement procedure there is allegedly also preference for businesses owned by “bumiputera” which are ethnic malays and other malaysian indigenous peoples additionally the judiciary is reportedly not independent and there have been alleged instances of selective prosecution preferential treatment and arbitrarily or politically motivated verdicts  any of these factors could disfavor an american company such as rorine   risks related to doing business in indonesia   our discontinued unwall technologies business also focused on indonesia it is possible that our planned healthcare products marketing business may also target the indonesian market reported risks of doing business in indonesia are similar to malaysia but allegedly much worse with the country historically reported to be riddled with endemic corruption again to the extent that these reports are true the company could be very seriously disadvantaged as an american company prohibited by law from bribing foreign officials   risks related to doing business in china   certain important certificates permits and licenses are subject to prc governmental control and renewal and the failure to obtain renewal would adversely impact our  business   it is possible that we will also target the healthcare products marketing business in the peoples republic of china prc as well as in indonesia and malaysia  doing business in the prc is subject to compliance with numerous permits and licenses licenses and permits must be complied with and renewed periodically during the application or renewal process businesses will be evaluated and reevaluated by the appropriate governmental authorities and must comply with the prevailing standards and regulations which may change from time to time in the event that the company with which were merger is not able to obtain or renew the certificates permits and licenses all or part of the combined companies’ prc operations may be suspended by the government which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition furthermore if escalating compliance costs associated with governmental standards and regulations restrict or prohibit any part of the operations it may adversely affect our results of operations and  profitability   uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us   any prc operations generally will be subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign invested enterprises in china the prc legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value since  a series of new prc laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to intellectual property rights and various forms of foreign investments in china however since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the prc legal system continues to rapidly evolve the interpretations of many laws regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws regulations and rules involve uncertainties which may limit legal protections available to you and us in addition any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention         since any future assets of the company will likely be located outside the united states it will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against the company and our officers directors and assets based in   china    while the company presently has no assets a full impairment having been taken upon discontinuation of our unwall technologies business it is possible that our planned healthcare products marketing business will acquire assets  although the company is a nevada corporation our officers and directors reside outside of the united states and all our assets will likely be located outside the united states  as a result it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states  upon the directors or officers or enforce against any of them court judgments obtained in united states’ courts including judgments relating to united states federal securities laws in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the prc or hong kong would recognize or enforce judgments of united states’ courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or have jurisdiction to hear original actions brought in the united states predicated upon the securities laws of the united states furthermore it would be extremely difficult to access those assets to satisfy an award entered against us in united states courts    item b unresolved staff comments   none   item  properties

precisely equal the related actual results management considers an accounting estimate to be critical  if     assumptions are required to be made and   changes in estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements   we have determined that none of the estimates meet those criteria of a significant  estimate   cash requirements   over the next twelve months we intend to use any

subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
