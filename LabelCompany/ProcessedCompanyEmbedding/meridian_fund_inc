principal investment strategy the fund seeks longterm growth of capital by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of publicly traded common stocks of us companies under normal circumstances the fund emphasizes growth companies that the investment adviser believes may have prospects for aboveaverage growth in revenues and earnings because of many factors including high sales growth high unit growth industry growth high or improving returns on assets and equity and a strong balance sheet the fund may invest in securities of companies with any capitalization across a broad range of industries these may include companies that are relatively small in terms of total assets revenues and earnings the mix of the fund’s investments at any time will depend on the industries and types of securities the investment adviser believes hold the most potential for achieving the fund’s investment objective the fund may invest up to  of its total assets calculated at the time of purchase in securities of foreign companies including emerging market companies the fund generally sells investments when the investment adviser concludes that better investment opportunities exist in other securities the security is fully valued or the issuer’s circumstances or the political or economic out look have changedrisk considerations there are risks involved with any investment the principal risks associated with an investment in this fund are set forth below please see the section “further information about principal risks” in this prospectus for a detailed discussion of these risks and other factors you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in the fund general risk — you could lose money on your investment in the fund or the fund could underperform other investments investment style risk  although the fund makes every effort to achieve its investment objective of longterm growth of capital it cannot guarantee that the investment adviser’s investment strategies or securities selection method will achieve that objective equity securities risk — equity securities holders are entitled to the income and increase in the value of the assets and business of an issuer after debt obligations and obligations to debt securities holders are satisfied equity securities fluctuate in price in response to many factors including historical and prospective earnings of the issuer the value of its assets general economic conditions interest rates investors perceptions and market liquidity market risk — the value of the fund’s investments will fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general stock market and economic conditions and the value of your investment in the fund may be more or less than your purchase price growth investing risk — there is a risk that the fund’s emphasis on investing in growthoriented companies may underperform during times when growth investing is out of favor small company risk — generally the smaller the capitalization of a company the greater the risk associated with an investment in the company the stock prices of smaller and newer companies tend to fluctuate more than those of larger more established companies and have smaller market for their shares than do large capitalization companies foreign company risk — investments in foreign securities may be subject to more risks than those associated with us investments including currency fluctuations political and economic instability and differences in accounting auditing and financial reporting standards emerging market securities involve greater risk and more volatility than those of companies in more developed markets significant levels of foreign taxes are also a risk related to foreign investments quick fund finder select

top investment philosophy  meridian funds meridian fund search search investment philosophy managing downside risk has proven to be one of the key drivers to quality returns over time which is why it is at the heart of meridian funds’ investment philosophy arrowmark colorado holdings llc arrowmark the funds’ investment adviser believes that avoiding companies with significant underperformance is a more critical component to portfolio success than looking to select just the best performers this approach that seeks to limit loss as the market falls and provide upside capture as the market rises is the hallmark of meridians investment philosophy consider the following scenario a hypothetical portfolio experiences a  loss of value during a market downturn that portfolio will need to return  to return the portfolio back to its starting value take this example out even further to a  or  loss and you begin to see how much you need to recover just to breakeven by limiting the downside through managing risk investors may achieve greater performance over a longterm investment horizon and just as importantly have more confidence and conviction to stay invested for the time needed quick fund

out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment
