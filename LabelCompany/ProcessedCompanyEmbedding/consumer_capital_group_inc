persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured ecommerce revenue recognition we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the net amount of sales earned as commissions we are not the primary obligor nor are we subject to inventory risk as the agreements with our suppliers specify that they have the responsibility to provide the product or service to the customer also the amounts we earn from our vendorssuppliers is based on a fixed percentage and bound contractually additionally the company does not have any obligation to resolve disputes between the vendors and the customers that purchase the products on our website any disputes involving damaged nonfunctional product returns andor warranty defects are resolved between the customer and the vendor the company has no obligation for right of return andor warranty for any of the sales completed using its website since we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage a fixedpayment schedule or a combination of the two we record our revenues as commissions earned on a net basis our sales are net of promotional discounts and rebates and are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers revenues are recorded net of sales and consumption taxes we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as daily sweepstakes reward opportunities that is based on volume of purchases and other similar offers current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in net revenues we record deferred revenue when cash is received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of goods deferred revenue is also recorded to account for the seven day grace period offered to customers for potential product disputes if any deferred revenue was  as of december   and  pp platform servicing fee income borrowers typically pay us a servicing fee on each payment received the service fees compensate us for the costs we incur in servicing the related loan including managing funding from investors payments to investors and maintaining borrower account portfolios we record servicing fees paid by borrower as a component of operating revenue when received deferred revenue was  as of december   interest income on loans interest on loan receivables is accrued monthly in accordance with their contractual terms and recorded in accrued interest receivable the company does not charge prepayment penalty from customers distribution revenue recognition we record product sales and shipping revenues net of return allowances when the products are shipped and title passes to customers return allowances which reduce product revenue are estimated using historical experience revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales and consumption taxes discontinued operations on april   the company sold its entire  equity interest of beijing beitun trading co ltd beitun to yifan zhang for  rmb yifan zhang is the daughter of ms wei guo the shareholder and managing director of beitun see note   discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information cash and cash equivalents we consider all investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents primarily represent funds invested in bank checking accounts money market funds and domestic chinese bank certificates of deposit at december   and  the company had no cash equivalents fair value of financial instruments the companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable advance to suppliers prepaid expenses other receivables other assets accounts payable accrued liabilities other payables related party payables convertible note short term debt and derivative liabilities these financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values for fair value measurement us gaap establishes a threetier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level  observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level  include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace level  unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable advance to suppliers prepaid expenses other receivables other assets account payable accrued liabilities other payables convertible note and short term debt approximates their fair value due to their shortterm maturities the companys level  valuation relates to derivative liabilities measured using managements estimates of fair value as well as other significant inputs such as volatility and risk free interest rate which may be unobservable see note  the company has determined the estimated fair value amounts presented in these financial statements using available market information and appropriate methodologies however considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value the estimates presented in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange the use of different market assumptions andor estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts management believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of related party payables because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been consummated at arms length the terms are not deemed to be market terms there are no quoted values available for these instruments and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments if any and the associated potential costs recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu  presentation of financial statements topic  and property plant and equipment topic  reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity the amendments in the asu change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area it also addresses sources of confusion and inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in us gaap under the new guidance only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued

does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements in may  the fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic  this asu affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets this asu will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in topic  revenue recognition and most industryspecific guidance the asu also supersedes some cost guidance included in subtopic  revenue recognitionconstructiontype and productiontype contracts the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchanged for those goods or services the standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements in june  the fasb issued asu  accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period the guideline requires performance targets which affect vesting and can be achieved after the requisite service period to be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered if achievement of the performance target becomes probable before the end of the requisite service period the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements the company does not expect these changes to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in august  the fasb issued asu  disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern the amendment in the asu provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose goingconcern uncertainties in the financial statements the new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entitys

determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity the amendments clarify how current us gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share specifically the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation in evaluating the nature of the host contract furthermore the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract rather the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument the amendments in this asu also clarify that in evaluating the nature of a host contract an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features ie the relative strength of the debtlike or equitylike terms and features given the facts and circumstances when considering how to weight those terms and features specifically the assessment of the substance of the relevant terms and features should incorporate a consideration of  the characteristics of the terms and features themselves for example contingent versus noncontingent inthemoney versus outofthemoney  the circumstances under which the hybrid financial instrument was issued or acquired eg issuerspecific characteristics such as whether the issuer is thinly capitalized or profitable and wellcapitalized and  the potential outcomes of the hybrid financial instrument eg the instrument may be settled by the issuer issuing a fixed number of shares the instrument may be settled by the issuer transferring a specified amount of cash or the instrument may remain legalform equity as well as the likelihood of those potential outcomes the amendments in this asu apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in hybrid financial instruments that are issued in the form of a share the amendments in this asu are effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   for all other entities the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods the company does not expect the adoption to have

noncontrolling interest   noncontrolling interests in our subsidiary is recorded as a component of our equity separate from the parent’s equity purchase or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions results of operations attributable to the noncontrolling interest are included in our consolidated results of operations and upon loss of control the interest sold as well as interest retained if any will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings   comprehensive income loss   comprehensive income loss is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners among other disclosures accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements for the years presented the company’s comprehensive income loss includes net income loss and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented

based on current tax law and also include in the current period the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions   the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made taxrelated interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense   we have implemented certain provisions of asc  income taxes “asc ” which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions as defined asc  seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes we adopted the provisions of asc  as of january   and have analyzed filing positions in each of the people’s republic of china “prc” jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions we have identified the prc as our “major” tax jurisdiction generally we remain subject to prc examination of our income tax returns annually we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position therefore no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to asc  in addition we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of asc  our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with incomebased tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based on rates established within the prc and adjusted for discrete items if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our estimated tax rate changes we make a cumulative adjustment income taxes payable as of december   and  were  and nil respectively     f        earnings loss per share   we calculate basic earnings loss per share by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period without considering common stock equivalents diluted eps is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted average number of dilutive common stock equivalents such as options and warrants options and warrants are only included in the calculation of diluted eps when their effect is not antidilutive the company had no dilutive securities as of december   and  for the years ended december   and  basic and diluted incomeloss per share were the same due to the company’s loss position   cash and cash equivalents   we consider all investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents primarily represent funds invested in bank checking accounts money market funds and domestic chinese bank certificates of deposit at december   and  the company had no cash equivalents   loan receivable   loan receivable primarily represents the principle of loan lent to the borrowers management regularly reviews aging of loan receivables and changes in payment trends and records allowance when management believes collection of amounts due are at risk loan receivables considered uncollectible are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection   allowance for loan losses   the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance the allowance is based on the company’s past loan loss history known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio current economic conditions and other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available   the company calculates the provision amount as below    general reserve — is based on total loan receivable balance and to be used to cover unidentified probable loan loss the general reserve is required to be no less than  of total loan receivable balance        special reserve — is fund set aside covering losses due to risks related to a particular country region industry borrower or type of loans the reserve rate could be decided based on management estimate of loan collectability   interest receivable   interest receivable represents the amount of interest that has been earned as of the balance sheet date but which has not yet been received in cash management regularly reviews aging of interest receivables and changes in payment trends and records allowance when management believes collection of amounts due are at risk interest receivable considered uncollectible are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection   deferred cost   deferred cost represents the deferred service charge paid or payable to a related party which is calculated based on the service fee the company received     f        loans from individuals   loans from individuals primarily represent the principle of lending funds received from the individuals through the company’s internet platform the interest rates of such loans ranged from  to  per annum with a term lasting from  months to  months   property and equipment net   property and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of computer equipment office equipment and furniture and is depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets generally three years or less costs incurred for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and expenditures for major replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives   impairment of longlived assets   we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets indicate their net book value may not be recoverable when these events occur we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value based on market value when available or discounted expected cash flows of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made the company’s management currently believes there is no impairment of its longlived assets there can be no assurance however that market conditions will not change or demand for the company’s products will continue either of these could result in the future impairment of longlived assets   segment reporting   the company follows asc  segment reporting the company’s chief operating decision maker who has been identified as the executive chairman of the board of directors and the chief executive officer reviews the individual results of the ecommerce and distribution businesses when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing the performance of the company as a whole and hence the company has two reportable segments before the disposition of the company’s distribution business the company’s operating businesses are organized and based on the nature of markets and customers as the company’s longlived assets are substantially all located in the prc and substantially all the company’s revenues are derived from within the prc no geographical segments are presented   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable advance to suppliers prepaid expenses other receivables other assets accounts payable accrued liabilities other payables related party payables convertible note short term debt and derivative liabilities these financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values for fair value measurement us gaap establishes a threetier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value   level  observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   level  include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace   level  unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity   fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value   the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable advance to suppliers prepaid expenses other receivables other assets account payable accrued liabilities other payables convertible note and short term debt approximates their fair value due to their shortterm maturities     f        the company’s level  valuation relates to derivative liabilities measured using management’s estimates of fair value as well as other significant inputs such as volatility and risk free interest rate which may be unobservable see note    the company has determined the estimated fair value amounts presented in these financial statements using available market information and appropriate methodologies however considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value the estimates presented in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange the use of different market assumptions andor estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts   management believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of related party payables because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been consummated at arm’s length the terms are not deemed to be market terms there are no quoted values available for these instruments and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments if any and the associated potential costs   sharebased compensation   we apply asc  equitybased payments to nonemployees to account for our service providers’ sharebased payments we gave common stock of to service providers to retain their assistance in becoming a us public company assistance with public company regulations investors’ communications and public relations with brokerdealers market makers and other investment professionals the cost of the equity based payments is recognized ratably over the service period we have elected to recognize compensation expense using the straightline method for all equity awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions sharebased compensation expenses amounted to  for the both years ended december   and    derivative liabilities   fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as ratchet provisions or conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments and measurement of their fair value in determining the appropriate fair value the company uses the blackscholes pricing model in assessing the convertible debt instruments management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement if the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt the company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments   once derivative liabilities are determined they are adjusted to reflect fair value at the end of each reporting period any increase or decrease in the fair value is recorded in results of operations as a change in fair value of derivatives in addition the fair value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants are also valued using the blackscholes pricing model   debt discount   the company records debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt these costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt if a conversion of the underlying debt occurs a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed   concentration of credit risk   assets that potentially subject the company to significant concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable the maximum exposure of such assets to credit risk is their carrying amounts as of the balance sheet dates as of december   and  substantially all of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were deposited in financial institutions located in the prc which management believes are of high credit quality management believes the credit risk on bank deposits is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international creditrating agencies or stateowned banks in china cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with stateowned banks within the prc and the united states of america balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the prc are not covered by insurance nonperformance by these institutions could expose the company to losses for amounts in excess of insured balances as of december   and  our bank balances with the banks in us exceeded the insured amount by  and  respectively as of december   and  our bank balances with the banks in the prc amounted to  and  respectively which are uninsured and subject to credit risk we have not experienced nonperformance by these institutions     f        financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents loan receivable from borrowers and the related accrued interest receivable as of december   the company has one significant borrower which accounted for  of total loan receivable balance the aforementioned borrower paid service fee and interest regularly according to the contract during the reporting period and the company believed that the default risk from this borrower is low in the foreseeable future   currency convertibility risk   we transact all of our business in rmb which is not freely convertible into foreign currencies on january   the prc government abolished the dual rate system and introduced a single rate of exchange as quoted daily by the people’s bank of china the “pboc” however the unification of the exchange rates does not imply that the rmb may be readily convertible into us dollars or other foreign currencies all foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the pboc or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the pboc   approval of foreign currency payments by the pboc or other institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers’ invoices shipping documents and signed contracts   additionally the value of the rmb is subject to changes in central government policies and international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the prc foreign exchange trading system market   foreign currency exchange rate risk   from july   the rmb is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies while the international reaction to the rmb appreciation has generally been positive there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar   business risk   foreign ownership of internetbased businesses is subject to significant restrictions under current prc laws and regulations foreign investors are not allowed to own more than a  equity interest in any entity with an internet content distribution business currently the company conducts its operations in china through a series of contractual arrangements entered into among arki beijing ecommerce technology corp america arki fuxin network management co ltd and america arki network service beijing co ltd the relevant regulatory authorities may find the current ownership structure contractual arrangements and businesses to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations if so the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations   litigation   from time to time we may become involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions we estimate the range of liability related to any pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated     f        related party transactions   a related party is generally defined as i any person that holds  or more of the company’s securities including such person’s immediate families ii the company’s management iii someone that directly or indirectly controls is controlled by or is under common control with the company or iv anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the company a transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties   note  — recently issued and adopted accounting

of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument the amendments in this asu also clarify that in evaluating the nature of a host contract an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features ie the relative strength of the debtlike or equitylike terms and features given the facts and circumstances when

considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance the allowance is based on the company’s past loan loss history known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio current economic conditions and other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available   the allowance is calculated at portfoliolevel since our loans portfolio is typically of smaller balance homogenous loans and is collectively evaluated for impairment   the allowance consists of the combination of a quantitative assessment component based on statistical models a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts value of collaterals and could include a qualitative component based on management judgment   finally as appropriate the company also considers individual borrower circumstances and the condition and fair value of the loan collateral if any     f        in addition the company also calculates the provision amount as below   general reserve    on total loan amounts at the end of year specific reserve

provisions            —   ending balance          —     note  — loan impairment   a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower including the length of the delay the reasons for the delay the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for corporate and personal loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent   an allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value currently estimated fair values of substantially all of the company’s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of the loan’s collateral which approximates to the carrying value due to the short term nature of the loans   loans with modified terms are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the company grants such borrowers concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve a temporary below market rate reduction in interest rate or an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments under the modified terms are current for six consecutive months after modification loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired   even though the company allows a onetime loan extension with a period up to the original loan period which is usually twelve months the principal of the loan remains the same and the interest rate is fixed at the current interest rate at the time of extension therefore there were no troubled debt restructurings during the year ended december     note  — deferred cost — related party   deferred cost consisted of the following at december   and        december       december     deferred
