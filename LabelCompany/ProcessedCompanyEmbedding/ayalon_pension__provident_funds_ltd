fund login apply online contact me what are the differences between a provident and a pension fund share via facebook share via twitter share via linkedin share via email question i am working for a company that uses  options for retirement saving option  provident fund   employer contribution and  employee contribution option  pension fund and pension provident fund   employer contribution and  employee contribution what is the best option for the employee and can one transfer funds from a provident fund to a pension fund when changing employment get up to  more savings with x more in the long run for you and your employees find out more answer goodnessthe two big differences between a pension and a provident fund relate to  the tax treatment of contributions and  the annuitisation requirement at retirementunder current law only the employer can claim a tax deduction for provident fund contributions if employees contribute in their own name ie not by way of a salary sacrifice then this money is returned back to them taxfree at retirement added to the taxfree cash lump sum with a pension fund both the employer up to  and the employee up to  can claim their contributions for tax the provident fund arrangement is probably more suitable for lower income earners who do not benefit from the tax deduction as their income is below the tax threshold as an offset a provident offers them more flexibility on retirement pension fund members must buy an annuity with at least twothirds of their retirement benefit whereas provident fund members can take the full benefit as cash which is the preferred option depends on the employees individual circumstances and what they intend to do at retirement with their savings to the extent that most people should not be entrusted with a cash lump sum at retirement because they will likely then outlive their savings the pension fund option is the more prudent onein terms of the proposed retirement reform which may come into effect by  the tax treatment and annuitisation requirements of provident funds will align with that of pension funds although vested rights will be protected for younger savers the question pension or provident fund will then become irrelevantyou can transfer your savings taxfree from a provident fund to a pension fund on changing jobs but you cannot transfer from a pension to a provident fund the
