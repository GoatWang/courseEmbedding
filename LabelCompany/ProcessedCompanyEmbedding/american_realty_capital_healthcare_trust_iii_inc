statements we have announced that our board of directors has established a special committee the special committee comprised of the boards independent directors to respond to the receipt of an unsolicited proposal the “proposal” from an entity the “proposing entity” sponsored by an affiliate of american realty capital vii llc the company’s sponsor the “sponsor” relating to a potential strategic transaction with the proposing entity the “proposed transaction” our board of directors has not made a decision to enter into any transaction at this time and there can be no assurance that the discussions and evaluation will result in a definitive agreement or that any such transaction would be approved by our stockholders all of our executive officers and directors are also officers managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in american realty capital healthcare iii advisors llc our advisor and other entities affiliated with ar global investments llc the successor business to ar capital llc ar global the parent of our sponsor as a result our executive officers and directors our advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest including significant conflicts created by our advisors compensation arrangements with us and other investment programs advised by affiliates of ar global and conflicts in allocating time among these investment programs and us these conflicts could result in unanticipated actions that adversely affect us because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other investment programs advised by affiliates of ar global our advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders no public market currently exists or may ever exist for shares of our common stock which are and may continue to be illiquid we focus on acquiring a diversified portfolio of healthcarerelated assets located in the united states and are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in the healthcare industry we have  million in cash on hand while we may use a portion of cash on hand to consummate additional acquisitions we generally expect to use cash on hand to fund distributions or for working capital needs our initial public offering the ipo raised significantly less capital than expected and we may not be able to access capital to fund our needs as a result we will be unable to achieve certain of our investment objectives such as the anticipated size and diversification of our portfolio without accessing other sources of capital the healthcare industry is heavily regulated and new laws or regulations changes to existing laws or regulations loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us we are depending on our advisor to conduct our operations adverse changes in the financial condition of our advisor or our relationship with our advisor could adversely affect us we may be unable to pay or maintain cash distributions or increase distributions over time we are permitted to pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source we have used and may continue to use net proceeds from our ipo which has lapsed in accordance with its terms and may borrow to fund distributions until we have sufficient cash flows from operations there are no established limits on the amount of net proceeds and borrowings that we may use to fund distribution payments except for those imposed by our organizational documents or maryland law we are obligated to pay fees which may be substantial to our advisor and its affiliates our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments we are subject to risks associated with any dislocations or liquidity disruptions that may exist or occur in the credit markets of the united states from time to time we may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes reit which would result in higher taxes we may be deemed to be an investment company
