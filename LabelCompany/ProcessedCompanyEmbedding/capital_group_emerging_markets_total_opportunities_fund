managers to exceed predetermined risk parameters with the objective of maximizing returns over the long term we have a comprehensive framework for addressing risk our research process and the capital

ideas overview united states international emerging markets fixed income portfolios economies markets rates politics investors in  are facing a world in transition the result of the us presidential election and the earlier vote by british citizens to leave the european union potentially reflect populist sentiment that appears to be challenging the decadeslong march of globalization what’s more investors are recognizing that aggressive central bank stimulus may have reached its limits and a transition to fiscal policy is at hand where should investors turn in such an environment our  outlook takes a trip around the globe detailing the most important economic and investment themes as well as the portfolio implications from investing in a changing world the global economy continues along its lowgrowth path but there are a number of bright spots in the us despite the political uncertainty a strengthening consumer is driving stronger growth a large fiscal stimulus under the new administration could well provide another boost to the us economy and in many emerging markets the rebound that began in  appears to have momentum supported by higher commodities prices and structural reforms europe remains challenged by uncertainty about the future of the european union low growth and high unemployment a sevenyear equity bull market has lifted stock valuations in the us but many parts of the world are trading at discounts emerging markets and international markets are both below their year average pricetoearnings ratio political and economic uncertainty remains but there are bargains to be found for active investors seeking solid companies at attractive prices us government bond yields are near record lows but are actually quite high relative to the rest of the world currently year treasuries yield more than  of developed market sovereign debt even if us rates rise and the new presidential administration’s policies are inflationary the “lower for longer” trend seems sustainable well into next year while europe and japan continue to experiment with negative policy rates and quantitative easing results from the us presidential election and britain’s vote to leave the european union highlighted a year where political populism gained momentum but even amid that uncertainty markets climbed a wall of worry in  the lesson for this it’s better to stick to your longterm plan and not get distracted by the latest political drama looking ahead policy changes will affect individual businesses in different ways so active investors will have an opportunity to
