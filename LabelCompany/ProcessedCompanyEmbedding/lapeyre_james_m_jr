industrial equipment he is also board chairman of ion geophysical a nyse company that provides seismic technology services and solutions to the global energy industry and past chairman of the business council of new orleans after hurricane katrina the business council has been a driving force in reform efforts such as consolidating the regional levee boards and the orleans parish assessors establishing an independent inspector general and supporting efforts to improve flood safety charter schools and criminal justice kaizen you grew up in new orleans lapeyre yes i spent four years in europe when i was a kid and four years away at college otherwise i’ve lived in new orleans kaizen you’ve lived in interesting times as they say—hurricanes oil spills louisiana politics and other challenges lapeyre those are just the local disasters laughs we also had  and the economic crisis but a lot of good things too the internet and the fall of the berlin wall so the world is dramatically better today kaizen the wall came down over twenty years ago now lapeyre yes  kaizen were you interested in a business career as a youth lapeyre yes but on a small scale i caught and sold fish in the market sold products door to door and started a day camp—i liked kids and sports and was allergic to manual labor i always liked to make and save money kaizen when you were a teenager what careers appealed to you lapeyre i leaned toward business but also thought i might be a lawyer my father started the business but his extended family invested in and owned over  so it wasn’t clear this business was a career path for me kaizen you earned your undergraduate degree from the university of texas at austin lapeyre correct kaizen why ut lapeyre i went there on a basketball scholarship and it was the best academic offer i had i worked hard but wasn’t good enough to play in the games so i hung around and practiced every day for four years kaizen did you major in business lapeyre no i majored in history and dabbled in philosophy and free market ideas i read ayn rand frédéric bastiat henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises and i found a history professor to sponsor a selfstudy course researching rand’s ideas kaizen how did history become your major lapeyre i started in english and it was too hard so i dropped english for history i believed liberal arts were a better background—that ultimately i could pick up the business training in graduate school kaizen does anything stand out from your undergraduate years that especially helped you later in your business career lapeyre yes the exposure to rand’s ideas on the morality of egoism pride and her exalted view of human potential to achieve and create and the austrian school of free markets and the role of prices and incentives together they gave me a passion for the power of ideas and some guiding principles that helped me avoid getting lost in the abstract i learned that everything in reality is specific and concrete that society markets and other groups are collections of individuals acting in their own interests and incentives information and clear rules are key to prosperity kaizen you returned to new orleans after your undergraduate degree did you immediately go to graduate school lapeyre yes a joint degree in law and business at tulane kaizen why those two degrees in particular lapeyre they combine for a good background the legal background gave me the confidence to simplify and not defer to the lawyers when they overlawyer and complicate the business training gave me the basics i needed in financial analysis strategy and market research again the tools to keep management processes simple and effective kaizen you then joined laitram the firm your father was a partner in lapeyre i joined the firm in january  at that time laitram had a high debt level—one business making money and four businesses losing money and shortly after i joined the one business making money declined sharply so difficult times kaizen laitram had been started by your father back in  lapeyre yes he invented a method to peel shrimp automatically as a boy my father worked in his father’s canning plant and shrimp peeling was done by hand workers would peel the shrimp and machines would pack and pasteurize the cans the shrimp peeler was a great invention and the business was highly profitable in the early days but the business was not wellrun so when the patents expired and competition increased we faced harder times then suddenly the shrimp disappeared from a couple of large fisheries we still don’t know why but the catch in alaska went from  million pounds to near zero in two years we speculate that the shrimp migrated under the polar ice cap but we don’t know what happened the combination of competition and reduced market created a financial emergency kaizen you mentioned four other business lines that your father started lapeyre yes my father had many inventions unrelated to shrimp peeling and laitram started divisions to commercialize those inventions when i joined he also had a dozen plus undeveloped patents and the company had other business interests all losing money two of the businesses had been losing money for ten years i tried to sell both but couldn’t find buyers who would pay an acceptable price my job was to improve management and turn both into money makers we abandoned one of the early businesses and also started and abandoned some others but today’s survivors are four of the businesses that existed when i joined and we’re working on another startup the original platforms continue to innovate and add new products and change business models distribution channels as needed to grow and improve the businesses kaizen so you were fresh out of graduate school in  and joined the company the company had five lines four of them losing money and then the fifth one immediately started to lose money what were your first positions in the company lapeyre i started as the company’s first inhouse lawyer but there wasn’t much structure or competence so i quickly moved into consulting with the division managers my uncle was company president but he wasn’t involved in operations my father and i got along very well so i just got involved and forced some decisions he had a great capability to see essentials in technology and markets but he wasn’t a good leader or manager so i worked the management side and we began to build a team and make improvements we discontinued one business and we had a big layoff early in  and gradually the business got better kaizen how many people overall were in the company when you joined lapeyre in  laitram had about  employees and revenues were about  million with debt of about  million kaizen in family businesses there are sometimes concerns about favoritism was that an issue lapeyre no my father had nine kids but i was the oldest boy and the only one with the skill set needed at the time the business quickly fell into desperate shape and many shareholders wanted out and no one else wanted in we gradually bought majority control and we struggled for eight years until around  when we became confident we had turned the corner kaizen you became president of laitram in  based on your track record in helping turn things around what was the overall state of the company in  lapeyre in  we were starting to become consistently profitable we had hired some good people and begun building the management team and we had begun to implement our management philosophy and system of continuous improvement in  i spent nine months defining the first draft of our management system before then we had lots of conflicts and disagreements on how to manage some believed in strong supervision and clear detailed rules and others believed we needed principles and a culture based on trust and self management we settled on the principled approach and started to get rid of cultural misfits we continued to refine the system training people and working to implement management practices and make the company more effective so by ’ we all believed we could build a successful company and we were attracting people who had some management experience to build the core of a management team by the way david kelley has a great article “a short course in rulebreaking” that captures the problems of living by rules and not principles and charles koch has an excellent book the science of success that explains the koch industries system of principled management kaizen for laitram’s business metrics in your first decade in  you had  million sales  million debt and about  employees where were things in  lapeyre by  we had about  million in sales about  million in debt and about  employees kaizen so by  you had your philosophy worked out and a core management team in position to do something about it what were the first major steps to make the culture happen because it’s more than just being a theoretical philosophy at that point lapeyre excellent question we thought if we trained the managers we would inoculate the company from all bad management so we trained the managers but nothing happened we then trained their subordinates and got some small improvements but the worst managers did not change so we established an annual survey of employees asking each employee to rate the effectiveness of their managers or supervisors this was extremely controversial and we lost a couple of managers who saw this as too “big brother” but after the first survey we began to see significant cultural change kaizen that’s the granular data on the ground lapeyre right kaizen what survey results were actionable lapeyre the surveys are anonymous to individuals but the data can be tracked by department we ask very specific questions is the manager honest is he or she a good problem solver does he or she make issues or problems clear what suggestions do you have to help the manager be more effective we cover the basics of being effective and we tie performance expectations to our management philosophy then we use that information in performance reviews and planning these reviews give a deep insight into whether someone is introspective self aware and committed to personal improvement does the person get it and accept responsibility to improve or do they complain that it’s the others’ fault over time the survey results are a huge driver to reinforce and improve the culture kaizen here the distinction between principledbased and rulebased is relevant a traditional temptation is for managers to think in principles but to give very specific rules to the employees they manage are you saying that at laitram you push the principles right down to the employee level lapeyre yes we want every employee to “think like an owner” so we expect commitment to the philosophy and we try to align incentives to performance we put  of pretax profits after a return on net assets in a pool and distribute the pool based on division performance and who has contributed most to company success this profit sharing promotes alignment as everyone has an interest in helping the business succeed when the business does poorly everyone understands why compensation is down and when the business does well most people are focused on trying to improve productivity and maintain or improve profits making money and distributing incentives links everyone to the same goal and has a powerful reinforcing effect on the culture we want everyone to be motivated and rewarded for pushing issues and working to help the company improve kaizen the  number—how did that come up lapeyre there’s no magic to the exact number but the percent needs to be high enough to provide strong incentives for improvement at the margin and not just “share” average returns so we share profits only after a return on net assets and use a higher percentage than if we shared first dollar of profits the high incentive percent is for creating above average returns and our base wages tend to be lower than market so everyone has significant pay at risk this increases employee focus and sense of urgency—everyone knows this is real money and that makes a big difference we also have a number of departmentlevel piecework gain sharing and sales commission plans that put pay at risk kaizen the allocation of the —what kind of metrics do you use there lapeyre the allocation to each division is set by formula and determined objectively by division financial performance our cfo and hr manager work with each division manager to recommend an initial allocation for the departments within each division the department managers then make recommendations for individual allocations before final our cfo hr manager and the division managers review the numbers including many of the individual managers before we finalize and adjust the distribution kaizen how many divisions do you have now lapeyre we have four intralox laitram machinery lapeyre stair and industrial microwave systems kaizen your management philosophy is called the laitram continuous improvement program does it have an explicit connection to the japanese kaizen management philosophy lapeyre yes both systems are principled and teambased approaches for operational excellence and continuous improvement and both lci and kaizen have some common roots that trace back to w edward deming’s work in japan our system was influenced by deming but we focus more on individuals and we put less emphasis on statistical analysis we want people to think first about what they’re trying to accomplish statistics may be a tool to help solve the problem but we don’t want people to substitute statistical analysis for systems thinking most importantly each individual is responsible for his or her work and we want a challenge culture we want people to think reason and debate before they reach alignment alignment is an end goal in the process but on important decisions we want a structured decision process with the intellectual rigor of first challenging assumptions kaizen one of laitram’s strong elements is its commitment to innovation one measure of that is your  or so patents how does the innovation happen here do you have an rd department or is it people on the ground lapeyre a combination most of the best ideas come from connecting our most productive technical and innovative thinkers with a clear understanding of customer problems so most innovation is organized by commercial teams but we encourage group rd or brainstorming sessions that cross teams we need to do more of that as we frequently find our best thinkers make valuable contributions outside their areas of immediate knowledge and engagement our most creative people are serial innovators so we want them to understand customer problems and share and challenge each others’ ideas for solutions these innovators are the engine of our business they develop ideas the rest of us don’t see and everyone benefits from the process and results kaizen the divisions that you have now do they track the five product lines at all that you inherited back in the s lapeyre some but not all we’ve had some failures we sold one division and we have a start up that’s unrelated to the original product lines the division sale digicourse was to ion geophysical for stock that’s a public company and we’re still a large shareholder kaizen your human capital—you’re interested in problemsolving innovative people you have an incentive process in place for them as well as a challenge culture how do you find those people in the first place or cultivate them when you hire them lapeyre great question—finding the right people was especially difficult in the early days today it’s still challenging but our culture size and track record help attract the right people and our hiring processes and operating teams help filter out misfits the work teams want people to help improve productivity and make money—people who focus on doing good work and don’t worry about who’s right or who gets the credit over time the credit takes care of itself if you have the right people and culture kaizen how many employees does laitram have now lapeyre about  kaizen that’s a lot of growth—about  times as many as when you joined the company do you recruit in particular places or for certain kinds of people when you’re going out lapeyre yes and no we look to attract the best from the industries we’re in and the technical specialties we need but we also recruit people who are successful in other fields and test them in different positions we have a number of lawyers managing commercial teams and our it manager was trained in advertising we let people prove themselves we expand their responsibilities some great contributors have had the same job title for many years as they and their teams continue to improve kaizen how many countries do you operate in lapeyre we do business in and have sales people in all industrialized countries and we have eight plant locations north and south america japan china australia the netherlands denmark and the uk kaizen if i may ask what are your annual revenues now lapeyre a little over  million kaizen another element in your continuous improvement management philosophy is transparency what does transparency mean at laitram lapeyre transparency means open books and no secrets no surprises and no hidden agendas we want an ownership culture so we want everyone to know what’s relevant to the business we don’t openly share salary information or information that is valuable to competitors such as some new product development acquisitions etc kaizen does that mean the numbers are available if people want to look for them or do you put the numbers out there on a regular basis lapeyre each division has quarterly meetings with all employees to report on financials incentives and performance relative to our critical success factors we want everyone to understand as much as possible about how we’re doing and we invite comment and challenge to help us improve kaizen given what you’ve said you’re not a ceo who has to do everything and be on top of everything you hire selfmotivated people you manage with incentives and transparency and you encourage creative problemsolving how would you describe your leadership style or define your role as ceo lapeyre every business has different needs at different times in a crisis i behave differently than how i manage in a more stable or mature environment today my most important job is making sure we have the right people and that we continue to build a performance culture committed to continuous improvement the right people and cultural alignment we then work on basic structure strategies and planning process so everyone is clear on his or her responsibilities over time smart people work their areas and think about the business and generate a stunning number of improvements efficiencies and innovations the external world is changing at an accelerating rate customers are changing technology is changing needs are changing so the opportunity for continuous improvement and innovation are huge so the right people and culture become even more important we must constantly challenge ourselves to ask “how can we make this product or service better how can we improve this process” our biggest division is extremely well run so i don’t add much i get involved to learn and i’m consistently amazed at what they do i’m much more actively involved in the smaller divisions kaizen the biggest is intralox the modular plastic products division lapeyre yes kaizen it’s clearly worked in  you received an award from citybusiness in new orleans as the best place to work what made them pick laitram for the award lapeyre i’m not sure how we got on their radar we were not ranked the year before and not much has changed our culture appeals to productive achievementoriented team players so most of our employees appreciate the opportunity they have to achieve learn and grow and contribute to and share in our success kaizen laitram is a privately held corporation what goes into the decision to be private instead of publicly held you mentioned ion geophysical which is publicly traded how is that calculation made lapeyre my experience with ion has reinforced my desire to keep laitram private the regulations for public companies are abusive and arbitrary regulations are a huge problem for private companies but they are much worse for the publics the accounting rules alone add so much waste and complexity they defeat their own purpose the regulators use thousands of rules to regulate and control that ultimately injure transparency more rules create more confusion and that brings even more rules they need fewer rules and a few guiding principles that mandate full disclosure and transparency with personal liability for fraud and gross negligence in failure to disclose as a private company we still face a huge number of senseless and wasteful rules but it’s much less than if we were public we’ve been able to consolidate the ownership and a dominant majority is longterm owners that lets employees know that their culture and the comp system will be in place for a long time we would consider going public if we faced a synergistic acquisition that’s too big or risky to finance privately fortunately there are more options today for private capital so the traditional motivation is declining in importance kaizen your industry is industrial manufacturing we hear a lot in journalism about the supposed decline of us manufacturing do you think there’s any truth to that lapeyre no it’s analogous to agriculture when technology improved productivity to free up labor and resources to invest in other areas so we now have cheap food and clothes travel tourism entertainment and online lifestyle enhancing information and services that didn’t exist twenty years ago much less a hundred years ago kaizen so we are producing more and we are doing it much more effectively lapeyre yes a significant detriment for the us economy is uncertainty and risk of increased regulations immigration restrictions are also a big problem the us would be the place of choice for global rd teams if the immigration restrictions were less onerous most industries are becoming global so this is a huge opportunity kaizen what about the relative costs of skilled and unskilled labor—the standard argument is that unskilled labor is a lot cheaper overseas does that not affect you because you are a skilled labor market lapeyre labor costs are important but productivity is more important direct labor is a relatively small part of our total costs i think that’s true for most us manufacturers our direct labor costs are well under  of revenue most of our costs are raw material subcomponents systems and facilities we can afford to pay more if we get people who own their work and focus on learning and continuous improvement the soft cost of training and managing people goes up with remote locations and different languages kaizen that reminds me of a line from john d rockefeller “a man’s worth a dollar a day from the neck down but there’s no limit to what he’s worth from the neck up” lapeyre yes and it’s not primarily about a person’s intellectual capacity it’s how the person uses that capacity to be effective in their work kaizen turning now to new orleans and its many challenges hurricane katrina was a disaster but also an opportunity to reform and rebuild for example the new orleans school system was dysfunctional and you’ve been involved in the reform efforts lapeyre yes the school reforms are huge and one of several major postkatrina reforms katrina demonstrated how government corruption devastated a community the local levee boards were responsible for inspecting and maintaining the levees and providing oversight on the corps of engineers’ work both the corps of engineers and the levee boards failed in their jobs and caused the levees to breach so katrina was caused by government failure on the federal and local level these government failures created a tremendous level of activism and community engagement that resulted in reform of the levee boards the assessors an independent inspector general elements of the criminal justice system and the schools seventy percent of the public schools in orleans are charter and they have had four straight years of significant improvements in test schools on this trend their performance will pass the state average in a few years imagine thousands of low income urban kids exceeding the state average—it’s going to happen kaizen that’s excellent news lapeyre yes it proves that charters aren’t about creaming the best kids parental choice and having the money follow the child changes incentives and gets everyone engaged the competition is improving the entire system these are huge lessons for the entire country we also have one of the strongest inspectorgeneral statutes in the country our ig has independent money and subpoena power to chase every city dollar he has authority to compel a witness to testify under oath and answer questions related to waste fraud and abuse in city government kaizen not just about schools and levee issues lapeyre yes the inspector general has broad responsibility to inspect all spending of city money this change has fundamentally disrupted the patronage business model—you can buy political influence and be confident in your investment so you see a lot of indictments but this is part of cleaning things up all positive kaizen that’s exciting what were your roles specifically in cleaning up the graft and the cronyism lapeyre immediately after katrina i became chair of the new orleans business council—the ceos of the major companies in the region we focused on reforms and improved quality of life we realized that if we couldn’t make the new orleans region a place where people want to live we would not be successful with business kaizen was the business council involved in the chartering of schools issues lapeyre yes but we didn’t lead that one we supported the reforms and one of our members leslie jacobs led the effort she’s been working for education reform for twenty years the business council was part of the leadership coalition driving levee board consolidation and reform the assessor consolidation and reform the inspector general implementation and criminal justice reforms kaizen the financial crisis hit in late  what was its impact on laitram lapeyre the crisis hit us in the fall of ’ and it was big our revenues dropped over  our profitability cratered and our debtequity ratios skyrocketed we had our first layoff in  years but we recovered far more quickly than expected by mid ’ we were growing again with market traction on some new technology kaizen was the downturn across all four of your divisions lapeyre all except the shrimppeeling business shrimp peeling wasn’t doing well anyway kaizen what was behind the downturn in revenues were people being cautious or did they not have the funds was it just a chain reaction where they were responding to things further down lapeyre yes with any bubble or malinvestment of resources the market first needs to selfcorrect before businesses can know what to expect the financial crisis was caused by a lack of system transparency that created huge uncertainty for commercial lending bankers couldn’t predict the money available and the criteria they’d need to lend so everyone went into a hoarding mode companies cut all discretionary spending killed major projects and delayed others and that caused the chain reaction you mentioned with layoffs throughout industry kaizen was your response to the crisis a matter of quick reaction once the trends were apparent or were there signs ahead of time so you were able to anticipate and position yourself lapeyre we moved pretty quickly our markets crashed in early fall and we made our layoff decisions in early december of ’ we took time to assess where we could cut with the least injury to our future and to cut deep enough to be reasonably confident we would not cut again unless things got a lot worse we wanted to be able to say “there are no guarantees but this is our team and we don’t expect more cuts” within four or five months we had become confident that was the case kaizen in  a year later things were good again lapeyre right kaizen then more disaster — the bp oil spill in  did that affect you lapeyre it crippled the gulf oil and gas and seafood industries so it hurt ion geophysical and hurt shrimp processing it did not impact our other businesses the spill ultimately caused little enduring environmental damage but the federal moratorium on gulf drilling permits is a continuing disaster even today there are no clear criteria and drilling permits are difficult to get this is a deliberate attempt to injure the gulf oil and gas industry kaizen over the past decade a series of crises and disasters have affected laitram are there any general lessons you can draw about disaster planning for business professionals how do you plan for disasters that you don’t know are going to happen lapeyre that’s a hard problem our size and global scope our experience and today’s information technology help a lot the best lesson is to make crisis mitigation planning a regular part of the planning process put the right team in charge and actually do the work to think and develop contingency plans ask “what do we need to plan and test our information and communication systems backups be sure our systems and plans for remote locations will work” this is a really hard problem for entrepreneurs starting out small business faces so many risks and problems they can’t cover everything kaizen having cash reserves planned places to meet and diversified assets help but also your philosophy of employing the kind of people who are invested and who can solve problems creatively lapeyre yes that is a given postkatrina management was mostly remote and communication was difficult so many people just came to work and began helping wherever they were needed people figured out how to get here ordered generators for electricity and started a service for all meals on site some people slept at the plant and many people were doing jobs they’d never done before we had a few managers who played critical roles but much of the work was conducted on the fly before top management could get organized we were struggling to figure it out kaizen your location helped—your father chose this part of new orleans to build upon because it’s high ground and near the airport your employees who were living here postkatrina—was it because their homes were devastated or because there were no transportation networks lapeyre the roads were mostly back so the people who lived at the plant or in company trailers had lost their homes and their families were still mostly living away with homes schools jobs—all of that was dislocated so they were mostly here without their families government moved so slowly and many believed the best thing they could do was help get this company back up to working kaizen what are you focusing on now for laitram’s future—the next five ten years or so lapeyre we like our people culture and business models so we’ll continue to innovate improve products and services and respond to continuing changes in our markets we organize globally and mandate english as our company language  everyone in our commercial teams speaks english as well as their native language our italians germans or chinese competitors can’t use their native language as a company language so they tend to organize regionally we also need to execute better be sure the lessons we learned still apply and be sure we stay focused and intense keep the edginess to keep and improve our challenge culture we can’t risk a closed mindset past success can breed a misunderstanding of what’s needed for future success kaizen if you look back—you’ve been president and ceo for a little over twenty years now—what’s been the thing you most enjoyed or the best thing about being ceo lapeyre the best part of what i’ve done is seeing a vision i helped create become actualized we all work for a purpose i’m motivated by the idea of building a great organization with every person committed to self improvement and to shared values of integrity innovation team work trust and rewards based on one’s individual contributions to attract people who share these values and to see the impact of these powerful ideas is tremendously rewarding using these ideas to learn from each other make each other better and literally create better selves while we build a successful business is exhilarating kaizen in the late s you were developing your management philosophy and you were able to use it to turn laitram around and grow it—to actually see that happen over the course of  years lapeyre right i would say very few of us realized we had the potential to play at our current level i suspect everyone in our senior management team would say “i’m much better today than i thought i’d be the team makes me better and i make the team better we’re not just more productive but better people” kaizen looking back over the years in your role as ceo is there anything that you have consistently struggled with or found challenging lapeyre the hardest part was losing money in the early years early in my career i struggled emotionally with firing people who didn’t fit with the skills or culture we needed losing money helped me make some hard calls with experience you learn that you let the facts control and give people choices today i still struggle with limiting priorities and cutting “good projects” to focus and be more effective with the best projects and initiatives it’s part of trying to do too much but that actually slows progress overall kaizen the traits of successful leaders—initiative decisiveness strategic vision clarity resourcefulness perseverance and so on of those are there one or two you would say are the most important lapeyre all are important and i don’t know that i can isolate one or two elements of leadership as “most important” effective leadership is about how one uses one’s abilities to assess the needs of the organization set the vision and action plans and get alignment and execution there are brilliant people who make good decisions in a crisis and permit no challenge they will not do as well building a management team of independent thinkers and institutionalizing a challenge culture what makes them great is that they have the right vision and people trust them for real time decisions i’m an independent thinker i’m not an original thinker i like to hear the best arguments and drill down to understand why someone disagrees i want everyone in the room to remind themselves that it’s not about being right but it’s about honoring the facts searching for the truth and making sure your ego isn’t in the way smarter people with better vision could probably get away with less of it than i need so having that discipline to ask “how do you know” over and over again can make all the difference kaizen younger people are still flexible and growing—how can they best cultivate those leadership traits in themselves lapeyre work with people you trust and respect and think carefully about the kind of person you want to be you can look at traits you respect and admire in others make that trait or habit part of you you’re not trying to be like that person but to learn a skill or habit make that trait mine to become more of the person i want to be be the best me any process of improvement starts by thinking setting a goal and defining what metrics you’ll use to assess the process as you get into the habit of selfimprovement what you learn is that it’s tremendously empowering if you learn to own your own destiny and create yourself that is a powerful part of what it means to be human and what it means to achieve the potential that you think you can develop in yourself so the advice i would say is start the process and set high aspirational goals then break down the first one or two things you want to work on first do those exceptionally well and when you have those mastered and move to the next and next remember there is no substitute for hard work and knowing your stuff kaizen back to younger people who are planning business careers you got an mba and a jd in the current business environment how important do you think graduate school is in general or mbas or jds in particular lapeyre i don’t think that the particular field is as important as the thinking skills you learn to apply to your experiences we have effective managers from many academic backgrounds and they figure out how to learn from each other and build those skills you pick up the particular skill that you may not have gotten industry has become—well society has become—so specialized that getting subject knowledge in all important areas is impossible i wish i had more science and engineering i just didn’t have the time i don’t think any one field is as important as that you really learn well what you learn and have it be fact and reason and reality driven so you become a good problem solver kaizen and apply that to the goal of creating the best complete life you can lapeyre exactly   stephen r c hicks all rights reserved be sociable share tweet
