auto injector smaller reusable and reliablethis is a personal project to redesign the epipen autoinjector i was a nut allergy sufferer for  years so this was a relevant issue for me and i felt it appropriate to endeavour to improve this product which could use some thought and innovation the device i designed reduces the overall size of the injector by folding in half this also conceals the needle to reduce the risk of accidental injury the epinephrine cartridge and needle are replacable by a chemist avoiding human error and allowing the device to be reusable  gokayak appearance model rugged gps and onetouch recordingthis was a university project the brief asked me to design a piece of hardware specialised for a specific purpose and make an appearance model of the design i identified the need for kayaking enthusiasts to keep track of where they are and the weather conditions easily without having to fumble around with a paper map or the risk of getting their smartphone damaged due to water contact out of this the gokayak was created a device with a built in carabiner clip that allows the user to view maps and local weather information quickly and at any orientation thanks to a circular display  boost cones daisychained signal boosting conesthis was a concept imagined by a colleague at ttp while i was on placement there the idea was to daisy chain specially designed traffic cones together to boost a signals strength this would help maintenance workers or technicians working in large concrete buildings that would diminish signal strength for their equipment this was a short project in which i designed an relevant feasible concept in a period of  days  central heating maintenance product family used for protecting central heating systemsthe client on this project makes chemical products that are used to protect central heating systems from corrosion i was required to design a collection of products that would allow the client to verify that their product had been used correctly in the installation of a domestic central heating system the collection of products i designed includes a small display that is connected to the boiler via a sensor dongle and a connection module that allows the clients products to be inserted into the heating system i was able to observe a technician in a dummy house drain and refill a central heating system while correctly installing the clients products this allowed me to understand the needs of the user in greater detail and design a more appropriate set of products  copd inhaler aesthetic rebrand for an existing devicethis project was about creating a new identity for an existing product without changing its internal components too much the challenge was to create an aesthetic that was modern and clean and would help to update the user’s perception of the brand and product the mechanical layout of the device was left the same with the cap being pulled upwards and rotated  degrees to prime the device a flow actuated drug release system and the reverse action to close the cap keeping the same mechanical layout allowed us to reduce the cost of the proposal while still giving the client a reason to redesign the product  storage chair bookcaseinspired storage chairthis was a project i did myself before arriving at university the motivation behind the idea was to be able to easily store the most frequently used living room items within an arms reach while maintaining a level of organisation cell therapy product concept for specialised cell therapy processescell therapy is a medical procedure currently in a period of rapid development in which the equipment used is being fast outpaced by the biology this project brief was to design a piece of equipment that could move a liquid from one bag to another in a sterile manner eliminating the two products currently being used to do the same job this was achieved by colleagues at ttp using a tube welder and peristaltic pump this is my product concept   lampost utility leasing lamppost power to third partiesthe concept behind this mount is to create access points on existing streetlights that could be leased to third parties as power outlets these could be used to power public wifi parking cameras or any number of devices or services i was asked to design the physical concept i produced this in less than a week  pcb casing casing design optimised for size to be as small as possible while on my placement with ttp i was given the opportunity to take a design to completion the whole way from ideation to production the product was a wireless communications pcb that needed a housing there were a set of requirements for the design of the housing mainly that it had to open and allow for the pcb to be removed for testing it also had to be as small as possible not allow the pcb to move and come in two sizes the final product and some of its development is show here bosch handrill this was a university project that helped develop my advance surfacing skills the brief was to pick an object that we could reengineer and surface model to optimise the design for additive manufacture i chose a bosch hand drill and combined many of the casing parts into multiple material rp parts a skeleton model was created first to define the major surfaces then individual parts were generated and thickened according the the design for additive manufacture the project helped me gain an appreciation of higher level modelling strategies that enable continuous curvature surface structure  virtual queuing concept pair of devices for virtual queuing this was a short project undertaken over the course of a couple of weeks the brief was to create a virtual queuing concept that would convey the possibility of the technology to the clients i designed a small palmsized control unit that allows the user to select the desired rides and timeslots and a wrist worn device that would vibrate to alert the other users in the group when they were near the top of the queue the main usecase is a parent controlling the rides and timeslots while the children wear the wrist unit to keep the parents up to date of the childrens location and status ie on a rideat a restaurant or not  travel dock promotional widget design and mould manufacturethis is a university project we were given g of plastic and told to design a mould tool that would produce a promotional ‘widget’ the brand i chose was skype and the design concept was composed of  components a white platform that locks into the blue backplate to provide a smartphone mount and a white circle that secures in the backplate as detailing once we had designed individual widgets we were split into groups where we had to pick our preferred design and then manufacture the mould and produce the widget  myauto worn by the patient to inject medicine over a prolonged period of timethis is a concept autoinjector device to be used for injecting small doses of medicine throughout the day due to the injection requirements of the medicine the device had to be designed so that it could be worn i designed this concept to be stuck to the patient using an adhesive layer on the underside of the device to be removed using the pull tab this project spanned a month and went through a number of iterations before being presented to the client  obiwan canobi electromechanical can crusherthis was a university project in which we were split into groups of three and asked to design an electromechanical can crusher capable of dispensing and crushing five cans in a row it had to be capable of crushing steel and aluminium cans in both ml and ml sizes the group began by designing three separate can crushers and then chose the best features to go together to make the final design this project helped develop my skills in designing novel mechanisms and doing hand calculations to verify a designs function this content shows the designs progression through manufacture and testing  auto injector — view — gokayak — view — boost cones — view — central heating maintenance — view — copd inhaler — view — storage chair — view — cell
