drilling vtg streetwise research contrarian smallcap gold  precious metals deep valuesummaryvantage drilling is a debtladen offshore drilling company with the right products at the wrong timedespite achieving profitability in  after years of losses the companys  billion backlog is depleting fast with no new contracts in sight for with no new contracts in the following quarters the companys projected ebitda in  would not be sufficient to cover the  million interest expensesthe companys stock and bond prices have been falling drastically over the past six months signaling an ominous and uncertain futurelike oil tanker or dry bulk operators offshore drillers know that their business is notoriously cyclical ultra deepwater drilling with highspecification floaters capable of reaching over  feet has been a new and lucrative business in the past decade the most well known company capitalizing on the booming business at the outset of the cycle is undoubtedly seadrill nysesdrl the company incorporated in oslo in  by norwegian shipping tycoon john fredriksen has been one of the most sought after stocks because investors consistently get about  dividend yield during the good times not to mention the phenomenal gain in capital appreciation seadrills ability to pay generous dividend is primarily due to the exorbitantly high day rates they get from oil majors for their services oil companies used to pay seadrill over halfamillion a day per rig albeit unwillingly because there was an acute shortage of modern floaters they needed badly to do deepwater exploration in a costeffective way the critical success factor is the companys perfect sense in timing the market in any free capitalist economy when someone starts a lucrative business there is nothing to prevent copycats from following suit among the latecomers to the party are vantage drilling nysemkt vtg pacific drilling nyse pacd ocean rigs nyse orig and north atlantic drilling nysenadl  a subsidiary of seadrill all four commenced the capitalintensive business within the past eight years unfortunately before they could open champagne bottles to celebrate their genius in duplicating seadrills success formula the party was over they are now bracing for an unprecedented downturn in their business this author believes vantage drilling would likely become the first victim of the bust cycle leveraged finance works only in good times seadrill created an enviable business model when the company started building its modern fleet in the early s how did it work it was simple during that period the cost of building a topnotch high efficiency drillship with a wide range of new capabilities was around  to  million because of the acute shortage of high spec deepwater floaters big oil companies were willing to pay halfamillion dollar or more per day to hire any driller with such rigs to do exploration and production for them based on these day rates the gross return on investment per annum was over  owing to the acute demand and supply imbalance deepwater drillers were able to secure multibillion backlogs of longterm contracts long before their rigs left the shipyards with guaranteed stable income from fatpocketed oil companies bankers would have little hesitation in providing these drillers huge loans or revolving credit lines even for startups without known financial performance they could simply issue highyield notes or convertible bonds to raise funds for their first rig in an era where investors are craving for yields recklessly their originations sold like hot cakes once the drillers raised enough funds to pay the shipyard and secured a longterm contract with an oil company banks would start lending to them for the second or third rig order when times were good their revenue was so colossal that drillers not only could cover the interest charge with effortless ease but also paid a handsome dividend to their shareholders as in the case of seadrill or north atlantic drilling vantage drilling was apparently late for the party vintage drilling a company based in houston texas incidentally or deliberately used the same leveraged finance model in building up their brand new fleet the company has a workforce of about  people with two regional offices in dubai and singapore their fleet size is relatively small compared to peers comprising four bmc  jackups and four dsme ultra deepwater drillships source vantage drilling website details of the fleet are as follows the timing of their entry into the ultra deepwater arena was supposed to be perfect after the financial crisis in  brent crude prices have remained at an elevated level between  and  per barrel until mid most important their high spec rigs were in great demand among big oil companies or independent explorers vantage drilling began their operation in  with four jackups as of today three are working in shallow waters off the coast of south east asia whereas the fourth off west africa their current day rates are between  and  their aggregate income is about one quarter of the companys total revenue in  in  vantage drilling contracted out their first fifthgeneration drillship platinum explorer to indias stateowned oil and gas natural gas corporation limited for a period of year the day rate was  in  the company secured an year contract with brazils stateowned petrobras nyse pbr for its second drillship titanium explorer the average contracted day rate was  in  their third modern drillship tungsten explorer secured a year contract with frances oil major total nyse tot the rig commenced work off the coast of west africa since mid the day rate achieved was the highest among the three  at a stunning  source vantage drilling annual report  in  the fleet utilization rate was the best of all time and the historic revenue was ample to cover all the operating financing and capital investment costs with a profit however when the management reported in early march their first annual profit of  million in five years they were not doing it in a joyful mood because the favorable operating environment they have long used to had a surprise turnaround in the past six months the abrupt change in market sentiments was clearly beyond their expectations today they are worrying about their highly leveraged balance sheet the decreasing backlog and the timing to seal new contracts for the current rigs and the th generation drillship being built in south korea the bust cycle is coming fast and severe no business has a neverending boom cycle in the deepwater drilling business when everybody joins the cause the supply of new rigs would increase rapidly and substantially in the event the new supply comes at a time when demand shrinks badly the bust cycle would begin without mercy the recent  plunge in global crude prices provided a timely trigger for the reverse of the cycle to the downside the low crude prices forced oil majors to reduce their capital expenditure drastically in the region of  in turn they delayed new offshore drilling projects or squeezed service companies to cut their day rates in current and future contracts some even went to the extreme by cancelling signed contracts the current hardship faced by offshore drillers epitomized the plight of the industry piled under mountains of debts yet without any contract opportunity in sight for their newbuildings or rigs just rolling off expired contracts it is highly probable that a few would not be able to survive the onslaught of the tough times this author believes vantage drilling would be one of the first to go under debt is root of the problem vantage drillings highleverage financing is a typical practice to capitalize on rare opportunities arising from the boom cycle of a capitalintensive business the practice is highly risky but extremely rewarding if the upswing cycle is long enough to enable companies to use the leveraged cash flow to reduce their debt drastically before the bust cycle arrives in the case of vantage drilling the worst scenario happens because winter arrives on the first day of their autumn harvest the predicament was worse due to the aggressive leverage of their modest equity the following table is selfexplanatory financial health ratios of vantage drilling and comparable peers company vantage drilling north atlantic drilling

service companies the market was fully aware of the risks associated with debtladen companies investors who read with care the preceding table would understand why the valuation metrics of these offshore drillers look extremely inexpensive market valuations of vantage drilling and comparable peers company vantage drilling north atlantic drilling ocean rig pacific drilling priceearnings

companies are inexpensive for a good reason  severe uncertainties ahead vantage drillings prospects are bleak look at the stock price chart of vantage drilling between  and  and compare it with s  p  and the oil equipment and service sector the divergence from the broad market index and the subgroup index speaks volumes source vantage drilling annual report  vantage drillings stock price saw an  historic high in may  since then it fell sharply to around  between  and mid as global oil prices started sliding since mid so did the share price currently the stock is trading around   the lowest level since listed in  or an  fall from the week high the stocks price actions suggested that investors had strong fear about the future of the company source barchartcom while most wall street analysts have a hold recommendation on the stock the recent free fall of the companys highyield notes indicated that the bond market was very pessimistic about its financial health the doubledigit yield suggested that vantage drillings bonds were trading at a distressed level according to a bloomberg report on  march  their bond prices fell about  in six months vantages largest bond  billion of  percent firstlien notes due november  dropped  cent to  cents on the dollar to yield  percent at  pm in new york according to trace the bondprice reporting system of the financial industry regulatory authority the companys  million of  percent secured bonds due april  fell to  cents to yield  percent from  cents on feb  according to trace both notes traded around par in september five reasons for extreme pessimism despite vantage drillings turnaround from loss to profitability in  the market is currently concerned about its mountain of debts decreasing backlog and financial sustainability the total amount of longterm debt on the companys balance sheet at the end of  was  billion whereas ebitda was  million the ratio of debt to ebitda was  a level considered highly unsustainable if there is no immediate reduction in debt or increase in earnings in the near future knowing that it would be extremely unlikely to increase earnings because of the poor market environment vantage drilling worked very hard to reduce debts in  alone the management retired about  million of debt by either repaying part of the loans or repurchasing highyield corporate notes in the open market source vantage drilling annual report  by the end of the first quarter of  the company forecast an extra reduction of another  million debt in the february presentation at jp morgan  global high yield and leveraged finance conference the company said the cash flow from operations projected would cover all debt service through  the first debt maturities would occur in  and the peak would come in  here is what they presented at the conference this author maintained the management appeared to be over optimistic about their future earning capability without giving full consideration of the nearterm poor job visibility and additional debt and interest burden brought about by the new drillship cobalt explorer in  current backlog is unlikely to service the  debt at the end of  the total backlog stood at  billion by the end of march  it would have reduced to about  billion the backlog for  was fine even though weakness has showed up in the jackups by the end of the year all the four jackups would have rolled off their existing contracts source vantage drilling q  earnings report the backlog in  did not look promising in fact it is bad among the peers source ihs petrodata extracted from a presentation by pacific drilling based on the current backlog vantage drilling would be able to generate in  total revenue of about  million the ebitda would be around  million which is ample to cover the  million interest expenses the second shipyard payment of  million for cobalt explorer income tax lease obligations and some debt repayments nonetheless  does not look promising at all source vantage drilling annual report  year  is the critical moment in  three happenings would determine the fate of vantage drilling the first is whether the company could fetch new contracts for the four jackups and drillship platinum explorer all of which would be out of job by end of  the second is whether the management could seal a commercially viable longterm contract for the new drillship cobalt explorer before it leaves the shipyard in early  the third and final one is whether financially troubled petrobras might force the company to reduce titanium explorers prevailing day rates in the midst of the year contract new backlog is imperative for survival given the highly leveraged balance sheet the interest burden on the company was immense based on the companys   and  financial statements annual interest expenses made up   and  of its total revenue respectively despite the companys efforts to pay off part of the debts since  core debts would remain around  billion by  key financial data of vantage drilling  year    revenue millions    ebitda millions    longterm debt billions    interest expenses  millions    source data extracted from morningstar the income expenditure and debt patterns in the past three years had been reasonably stable for the company and represented the maximum earning capability of the current fleet at almost full utilization rate the editda was roughly about  of the annual income as of today the projected income from existing backlog for  was  million see the previous table on revenues contracted in  and  the amount primarily came from the two drillships contracted to petrobras and total the estimated ebitda would be about  million the sad fact is the free cash would be insufficient to cover the  million interest not to mention tax provision or debt repayment this is how dire the financial situation would be for the company if no new contracts add to the current backlog in  i do not see how the company could pay the outstanding  million debts in  unless the fleet could achieve  utilization in  and beyond otherwise default would be a likely scenario almost zero job visibility in the market at the past quarterly earnings conference calls of key deepwater drillers three common themes emerged first jobs were rare and oil companies were unwilling to offer any tender opportunity until the very last minute second bids for any tender were extremely competitive day rates were about  below the peak times while contract period became relatively short third some oil companies particularly national oil companies started asking for pricing concessions in existing contracts or outright cancelled signed contracts paul bragg chairman and ceo of vantage drilling painted a very gloomy picture of the rig supply situation as well as job opportunities for offshore drillers in the  annual report the company predicted that the total number of jackups to be delivered in  and  would be  whereas drillships  the current meager demand could by no means absorb the new supply bragg said there was almost zero visibility in the market it seems apparent to me that customer spending or more precisely lack of spending is being driven more by desire to obtain pricing concessions from the supplier base basically the thought pattern would be well if we wait longer the competition is going to be more intense and the price is going to be lower as a result there are almost no visible fixtures or tendering opportunities in the marketplace the drop in activity is extreme and it is not consistent with just reduced spending whether our customers are going to reduce their spending about   or  we are actually seeing tendering activities that approaches zero given the relatively small size of the company and the fleet vantage drilling would be at a very disadvantageous position in such a depressed market environment to make things worse oil majors would surely prefer drilling contractors with a sound balance sheet and the most advanced newbuildings fresh from the shipyard the recent award of a  million contract by the italian oil company eni nys ee to maersk drilling for their newest drillship at an average day rate of o is a case in point vantage drillings current attempt to secure a contract for cobalt explorer at a good price would be a big challenge not to mention the year old platinum explorer without any new job in  the company would be in deep trouble cobalt explorer is a big headache the company announced early this year that they would put off the second shipyard payment for cobalt explorer until july the new delivery date would postpone to the first quarter of  bragg was adamant at the previous conference call that unless they could seal a contract for the stateoftheart drillship at a commercially sound day rate and for a reasonably long period they would prefer the rig to stay at the shipyard we do not anticipate that we would undertake delivery of the unit without a contract of sufficient economic value to justify the addition giving consideration to financing alternatives as such the delivery of the unit may not occur unless there has been some recovery in conditions and we are successful in contracting the unit braggs holdon strategy had good reasons it was all about mathematics the delivery of cobalt explorer without a contract of sufficient economic value would undoubtedly exert extra debt and interest burden on the company it was clear that the company would use debt financing to settle the  million final shipyard payment given the companys current debt profile the interest rate charged by any lender would be on the high side probably  the annual interest would be around  million or about  a day given the daily operating cost for a drillship is about  the total cost would add up to at least  per day therefore it is apparent that any deal with a day rate below  does not make business sense to bragg nonetheless the harsh reality was that most recent contract awarded to maersk drilling is mere  hence cobalt explorer was indeed a big headache to bragg the following paragraph in the companys  annual report summed up the dilemma in the most succinct way we are currently pursuing drilling contracts for the cobalt explorer and the timing and extent of any such contracts is a significant factor that will affect our financing alternatives which may have a significant impact on our liquidity position in  we expect to fund the balance of the purchase price of the cobalt explorer by debt financing which we may not be able to accomplish on commercially reasonable terms if at all concession requests from petrobras would be detrimental the year contract with petrobras has virtually become the cornerstone of vantage drillings current backlog over  any request for renegotiation of terms or rates would be a great blow to the company because the annual  million income from the contract ending in  was the most visible and reliable revenue in the years ahead petrobras recently pulled off contracts from seadrill and transocean nyse rig though fitch ratings believed a largescale renegotiation exercise with current contractors was unlikely in case such a request happens regardless the extent of concessions the market would react violently and create a lot of volatility for the companys stock and bond prices this may become the last straw breaking the camels back vantage drilling is an ideal short recently there has been a spate of bad news surrounding offshore drillers and the continuing over supply of crude worldwide at present there are no signs of price stability supply is still at all time high source eia baker hughes unless global crude prices become stable in the next few quarters oil companies would withhold their capital expenditure investments and the uncertainty of offshore drillers would continue to intensify during the bad times highly leveraged companies would experience the greatest challenges vantage drilling is no exception besides the debt burden there are two other factors affecting the markets perception of the company one is the ongoing  billion lawsuits with the companys former director and largest shareholder nobu su the litigation would prevent any interested parties from buying into or acquiring the company even when the management may consider a strategic review the other factor is the frequent insider selling by senior members of the management team when the company is in troubled waters source marketwatchcom these two factors alone would make any white knight think twice or thrice in the event that the company calls for help in the following three quarters before the end of  if there were no new backlog added the company would be heading for a bad
