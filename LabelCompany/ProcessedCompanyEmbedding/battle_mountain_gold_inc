side of a mountain to explore for or access a mineral deposit airborne magnetometer a device to measure variations in the earths magnetic field while being transported by an aircraft anomaly not an ore deposit but a statistical abnormality encountered during geochemical andor geophysical exploration an anomaly provides a target for further exploration in particular drilling assay an evaluation of a rock or soil sample for metal values base metal metals such as lead zinc and copper bedrock the solid rock comprising the crust of the earth upon which lies overburden in the form of soil pebbles gravels water etc beneficiate the treating of ore which results in a more concentrated form of the product claim an area of land or water which carries the mineral rights and must be recorded in a government claim recording office concentrate the resulting product after treating ore in a mill to remove much of the waste prior to shipment to a smelter core the resulting test sample from a diamond drill drill core is often cut in half lengthways with onehalf assayed and the other half saved for future study crosscut a horizontal underground tunnel driven from a shaft or drift toward an orebody or vein and cut across the direction of the orebody depletion when an orebody is mined it is depleted dilution the lowering of the grade of an orebody being mined by the addition of lower grade or waste rock to the mill feed dip the angle that a stratum of rock or any planar feature makes with the horizontal dip is measured perpendicular to the strike and in the vertical plane for example a vein is dipping  degrees into the earth drift a horizontal underground opening driven alongside or through an orebody to gain access to the mineral deposit drill there are various types of drills for exploration such as a diamond drill produces core or reverse circulation drill produces chips other types of drills are used for the mining process which do not produce a core but are used to make circular holes in the rock which are filled with explosives dyke or dike a tabular body of igneous rock that cuts across the structure of adjacent rocks electrolytic part of the refining process in which the product from the smelter is refined using an electrolytic process to purify the metal the metal being refined forms the positive anode and is deposited on the cathode by an electric current fault a crack or break in the bedrock of the earth where one side has slipped in relation to the other flotation a separation process used in milling ore in which the valuable minerals cling to bubbles and float to the surface while others sink geophysics the use of geophysical techniques to search for mineral deposits common geophysical surveys include magnetic electromagnetic induced polarization resistivity and gravity glory hole a colloquial term for a pit or large hole made from surface to mine a mineral deposit gossan a rustycoloured rock outcrop that can be a good indication of mineralization the rust is caused by iron in the rocks oxidizing a common copper mineral chalcopyrite cufes oxidizes to a rusty surface grab sample a randomly selected sample of rock to be assayed a grab sample will not provide a representative picture of the value of a deposit only an indication grade the value of a mineralized deposit precious metals are usually expressed as ounces per ton or grams per tonne base metals and uranium are expressed as a percent diamond values are expressed as valuecarathundred tonnes igneous rock a rock that has solidified from molten material eg granite kimberlite the host rock of diamonds diamonds are not formed in kimberlite the kimberlite only acts as a medium of transport to carry the diamonds up toward the surface the diamonds that survive the voyage to the surface are in what is called the diamond stability field diamonds are also found in lamproites level an underground mining term denoting a horizontal tunnel leading away from the shaft levels are usually at regular intervals of depth matte the metalbearing product from the smelter that is sent to the refinery metamorphic rock a rock that has been formed from igneous or sedimentary rock eg sandstone becomes quartzite mill the plant which concentrates the raw ore by separating the waste from the valuable metals the concentrate from the mill is sent to a smelter muck a slang term for broken rock or ore mucking machine an underground vehicle on tracks powered by compressed air that scoops up blasted and broken ore and tosses it over itself into an ore car on tracks outcrop bedrock which is exposed on the surface of the earth overburden the sand gravel peat soil swamp water etc which lies on top of bedrock pilot plant a smallscale mill set up on the mine property to test recovery techniques before building a large mill placer an alluvial deposit of gold or other metals which are contained in a sand or gravel bar in a river or beach present or former the grains flakes and nuggets were eroded from bedrock or lode deposits and washed down to the stream beach etc precambrian shield a ushaped area surrounding hudson bay consisting of older rocks of the precambrian age the shield contains many areas of mineralization some of which have become producing mines prospect a geologically favourable area for minerals to occur raise an underground tunnel that has been driven upwards either at an incline or vertically recovery the amount of mineral in ore that is separated and recovered in a mill usually expressed as a percentage per tonne of ore treated refining the final purification process of a metal or mineral see electrolytic resources  reserves mineral resources and reserves must be reported according to the standards of national instrument  mineral resources are subdivided in order of increasing geological confidence into inferred indicated and measured categories an inferred resource is the quantity and grade that can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonable assumed but not verified geological and grade continuity the estimate is based on limited information and sampling of outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes an indicated resource is the quantity and grade that can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the application of technical and economic parameters to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing data from outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological ad grade continuity to be reasonably assumed a measured resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity grade densities shape and physical characteristics as so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of technical and economic parameters to support planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing data from outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological ad grade continuity to be reasonably assumed a mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study this study must include adequate information on mining processing metallurgical economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate economic extraction can be justified a probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study this study must include adequate information on mining processing metallurgical economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate economic extraction can be justified a proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study this study must include adequate information on mining processing metallurgical economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate economic extraction can be justified scoop tram a specially designed underground vehicle for scooping out blasted ore and transporting out of the mine sedimentary rock a layered rock resulting from the consolidation of sediments eg sandstone coal limestone shaft an opening cut downward into the earth from the surface for transporting personnel equipment supplies ore and waste it is also used for ventilation and as an auxiliary exit it is often equipped with a surface hoist system which lowers and raises a cage in the shaft as well as skips or containers for bringing up ore or waste smelting the partial recovery of metal from processed ore the latter will have been treated and concentrated at a mill but smelting is required to actually recover the metal content and convert it to a form that is ready for refining staking the measuring of an area of ground and marking with stakes or posts to establish and acquire mineral rights some jurisdictions have now implemented online or map staking that is accomplished with a personal computer and credit card stope a mining area established on an underground level where ore is blasted and broken strike the direction of a structural surface for example the bedding plane of a sedimentary rock tailings waste material from a mineral processing mill vein an opening fissure or crack in rock containing mineralized material winze a vertical or inclined internal shaft sunk from one level to another in an underground mine battle mountain gold inc  investor

battle mountain trend which hosts a series of gold mines marigold lone tree fortitude phoenix twin creeks midas trenton canyon with resources or past production collectively exceeding more than  million ounces of gold opportunity precious metals the main exploration targets are highgrade structurally controlled veinsfaults and lowergrade disseminated skarns and replacements associated with northerlytrending structures and tertiary intrusions overview nevada is the worlds third largest goldproducing region after south africa and australia accounting for  of us production most of the states gold and silver comes from the prolific carlin trend and the parallel battle mountain  eureka trend the lewis property is strategically located within the battle mountain trend which hosts a range of mineral deposit types including highgrade veinhosted gold deposits large goldcopper porphyry systems with associated peripheral goldsilver skarns and sedimentaryrockhosted disseminated gold deposits mining commenced in the vicinity of the lewis property in the s with the exploitation of goldsilver lodes by surface and undergroundmethods the lewis property of battle mountain gold inc “the company” is located directly contiguous with the fortitude  phoenix mine placed into production by newmont mining corporation in late  the northern portion of the openpit abuts the lewis property future diamond drilling by battle mountain gold inc which is scheduled to commence in midaugust  will test from  m to  m from the margin of the fortitude openpit the fortitude  phoenix is one of the largest milling operations in the united states metals production in calendar  from the phoenix operations includes  ounces of gold  million pounds of copper and byproduct silver and at december   reported proven and probable reserves of  million ounces of gold  million pounds of copper and  million ounces of silver as indicated on pages  and  of newmont’s  annual report the average grades associated with these stated reserve figures are  grams per metric tonne gold  grams per metric tonne silver and  copper the highgrade portion of the fortitude deposit was original mined by battle mountain gold company a subsidiary of duval corporation in january  the deposit reserves were reported as  short tons  million metric tonnes at  troy ounces per ton of gold  grams per metric tonne au and  troy ounces per tonne of silver  grams per metric tonne ag as published in the prospectus of battle mountain gold company in july  the ore in the original fortitude mine consisted of calcsilicate and skarnlike calcareous rocks adjacent to the tertiary copper canyon stock these calcareous hostrocks are replaced by sulfide minerals which are associated with gold and silver in the form of electrum and silverbearing sulfides it is this style of higher grade goldsilver mineralization that the company has targeted in its current exploration program previous operators at lewis focused their exploration efforts on the virgin zone a major structuralstratigraphic corridor which hosts the mineralization at newmonts adjacent fortitude  phoenix mine the programs of these companies confirmed that the virgin zone extends onto the lewis property within a similar geological environment for up to  km of potential strikelength after securing an option to earn  of the lewis property in  since earned madison minerals inc the predecessor to the company focused its exploration on the virgin zone and to a lesser extent the buena vista zone that lies about  m towards the west from  to  madison drilled  reverse circulation rc and  core holes totaling  m  ft at the lewis property  of which tested the virgin zone seven drillholes tested the shallow portions of the buena vista zone the vast majority of these  holes intersected goldsilver mineralization one of the best results was obtained from a fault intersection along the virgin zone which returned high grades of  gt gold and  gt silver over  meters  ft mad in may  battle mountain gold inc executed a reverse takeover of madison minerals inc and commenced trading as bmg on the tsxv through the completion of a private placement to gold standard ventures corp and other subscribers in may  the company raised gross proceeds of about  canadian this placement and subsequent actions allowed gold standard ventures corp to control more than  of the company some of the funds generated through related actions led to the buydown of the existing royalty for gold and silver on the lewis property from  to  and the conversion from a gross royalty to a net smelter returns royalty the results of previous recent and ongoing exploration programs will be used to generate an initial ni  compliant resource estimate for the lewis property historic exploration the lewis property was historically mined for highgrade silver gold and base metals and was first drilled in modern times by hart river mines  the discovery and development of a series of worldclass gold deposits in the carlin and battle mountain  eureka trends during the s attracted several major companies to intermittently explore the lewis property notably homestake mining santa fe pacific and the predecessor company of barrick gold a subsequent round of exploration took place from  to  when united texsol mines inc drilled holes utx  the fortitude mine adjacent to the lewis property was the most significant gold producer in the battle mountain trend during the s and became the flagship operation of battle mountain gold company which was formed in december of  to assume the gold mining operations of duval corporation as fortitudes highgrade reserves declined in the early s battle mountain gold diversified from its namesake district to pursue projects worldwide from  to closure in early  the fortitude skarn deposit produced  million ounces of gold and  million ounces of silver from  million tons of ore with heapleaching of lower grade disseminated ores continuing until  newmont mining corporation acquired the battle mountain gold company through a merger process completed in early  and soon after reactivated exploration of the phoenix deposit the lower grade outer shell of the pastproducing fortitude mine the newly constructed phoenix mine began operations in late  in time to benefit from rising gold prices the intermittent exploration efforts of previous operators at the lewis property during the s and s focused on the virgin zone a major goldsilverbearing structuralstratigraphic corridor which hosts the mineralization at newmonts adjacent fortitude mine these early programs confirmed that the virgin zone extends onto the lewis property within a similar geological environment for up to  km of potential strikelength north of the claim boundary several parallel zones of mineralization were also tested however the majority of the drillholes were completed to depths of less than  m  exploration program of madison the  drill program of madison consisted of  core holes for a total of  meters and  rc holes for a total of  meters which targeted the central portion of the virgin zone and consisted of infill and stepout holes using a drillspacing of  meters the core drilling confirmed the previous rc results as well as the geological and structural models while the overall drilling program expanded the virgin zone by  meters downdip over a meter strike length at yearend  the northerlytrending virgin zone was defined over a minimum meter strike length and  meters eastwest the zone remains open for expansion along strike and downdip to the west the  drilling program also encountered significantly higher silver values as an example hole mad intersected  gt gold and  gt silver over  meters for a calculated equivalent of  gt gold at us per ounce silver and us per ounce gold over the interval these results suggest an apparent mineral zonation on the property with silver values increasing to the north and west results from the  drilling program compare favorably with previously reported styles and grades of mineralization including highgrade gold structural intersections steeply westdipping mineralized zones and gently westdipping lowergrade mineralization hosted by reactive antler sequence stratigraphic units the majority of the  drillholes intersected zones of gentlydipping lowergrade mineralization madisons exploration programs confirmed that the lewis property shares a virtually identical geological environment to that underlying the fortitude  phoenix area including the alongstrike extension of the northerlytrending virgin and copper canyon  buena vista zones and reactive antler sequence rock units the southern boundary of the lewis property abuts newmonts present open pit which means any new or proposed northerly or westerly expansion of this pit would require a pushback onto the lewis property  –  exploration programs the company commenced its recent exploration of the lewis property in late june  the fieldwork completed to date consists of detailed geological surface mapping scale geochemical rock and soilsampling and relogging of diamondcore and rcchips from drillholes completed by madison minerals inc from  to  the emphasis during this work has been on the geometric controls to goldsilverand base metalbearing fault and fracture systems these target structures cut across several rock formations that have properties conducive to metals deposition including the same antler sequence formations that host ore in the fortitude mine of newmont located directly to the south at least eight mineralized zones were previously recognized in the lewis property refer to slides in the corporate presentation included in the investor info – presentations section of the website and corporate pressreleases from june  to recent the best understood goldsilver systems to date include the virgin buena vista meagher  silver white  shiloh and trinity zones which are open along strike and at depth gold and silverbearing portions of these zones exceed  m for the virgin  m for buena vista  m for meagher  silver  m for white  shiloh and  m for trinity recent geochemical sampling of these zones and news areas of mineralization indicate rock results of up to  gt au  gt ag  pb and  zn individual sample assay results are described in the rockchip database included in the investor info – presentations section of the website the samples were collected from steeply dipping northerly and northwesterlystriking fault and fracture zones that are typically illitic clayaltered and characterized by ironoxides that have formed from the weathering of pyrite galena sphalerite and locally arsenopyrite the outcrop samples are from zones  to  m wide that lie within broader belts of structure  hydrothermal alteration up to  m wide the results of  rock samples collected over the property as of june  are summarized as follows gold –  samples   of all samples contain   gt  yield   gt  contain   gt with maxima of    and  gt au silver –  samples   contain   gt  yield   gt  contain   gt with maxima of    and  gt ag lead and zinc –  samples contain    pb with a maximum of    samples return    zn with a maximum of   zn silver values in rock up to  gt ag and gold results up to  gt au characterize the meagher  silver zone in the western part of the property this zone consists of two northtrending and westdipping faults each more than  m long these mineralized structures and those of the buena vista system with surface values of up to  gt au and  gt ag extend to the south into the fortitude coppergoldsilver mine the intersection of these mineralized structures with the reactive rocks that host ore in the fortitude deposit represents an attractive drill target that lies from  to   m beneath surface in the lewis property in late a total of  soil samples were collected along traverses oriented across the northerlytrend of the trinity system in the southeastern part of the claim area the samples are spaced every  m  ft with every two samples composited to form  assay samples for a nominal spacing of  m  ft the assay results indicate high values for gold silver lead and zinc the combined gold au   ppb and silver ag   ppm soil anomaly is localized along a northnortheasterly trending portion of the trinity fault zone and exceeds  m in strikelength with widths of up to  m this anomalous goldsilver zone is supported by a coherent lead and zinc anomaly using thresholds of  ppm pb and  ppm zn rock chip samples from the trinity return up to  gt au  gt ag   pb and   zn see rockchip sample database for individual sample assay results future work in this area will focus on followup surface mapping and drill target delineation hyperspectral imagery hsi was acquired over the lewis property and portions of the adjacent newmont mine operations on july th  by spectir llc using an aisa eaglehawk dual dual hyperspectral camera system carried by a light aircraft approximately  km of data were acquired with a nominal ground resolution of  m the dual system acquired  spectral bands between  and  nanometers with spectral resolutions ranging from the visible to shortwave infrared similar types of hyperspectral analysis have delineated mineral zoning and directions to orebearing structures in gold and silverbearing deposits elsewhere in nevada eg goldfield utah eg tintic district and mexico eg fresnillo region a groundbased spectroscopy survey was completed in support of the airborne survey during august  a total of  surface samples and  drillcore samples were analyzed using a terraspec pro spectrometer the results of the airborne and groundsurveys have been integrated with local geology to produce a coherent interpretation over the project area in gold and silverbearing structural zones hsi illite commonly occurs with hsi hematite and jarosite which are ironoxide minerals that developed from the weathering of sulfide minerals there is a close spatial coincidence of hsi hematite and jarosite to known prospects and structures the combined spectral surveys identified new zones of exploration interest some of which are characterized by ammoniumillite ammoniumillite has the potential to delineate structures that tap goldrich zones at depth as indicated for carlintype gold deposits in nevada eg goldstrike and jerritt canyon and epithermal gold deposits in argentina eg esquel hematite typically occurs within zones of ammoniumillite hosted in the nevada carlintype deposits followup sampling of these ammoniumillite anomalies have produced targets at galena and the apex antimony mine which are characterized by surface rockchip results of up to  gt au  gt ag  as and    sb see rockchip sample database for individual sample assay results during late the company completed the digitizing of downhole geology logs and multielement assays for about  drillholes completed by hart river barrick and sante fe during the s and s most of the added holes are less than  m deep and collared in the trinity white  shiloh hider and circle peak areas the current digital drillhole database which includes  drillholes in the virgin  buena vista area now totals approximately  drillholes the incorporation of this historic data into the lewis property digital database has assisted in the creation of d geological models for mineralized structures and favorable rock units in the southern part of the claim area also during late a total of  diamond drillholes were relogged from the virgin area for a total of  m or   of the drillcore collected by madison minerals inc during  to  in mid rcchips from  holes were relogged for  m or  of the rcchips available the focus of the relogging campaign was to better define lithology hydrothermal alteration sulfide mineralization and structure in drillhole and to ensure consistency with the surface mapping recently completed by the company the integration of the results of the relogging program with the districtwide drill database has enabled the construction of about  westeast oriented geological crosssections threedimensional imaging of geophysical results from a quantec titan  ip survey from  and a zonge ip survey from  completed over the virgin and buena vista areas was undertaken in late the magnetotellurics mt data from the quantec survey were reprocessed by sourceone geophysical using modern algorithms in the rd quarter of  this reprocessing has improved the resolution of the results and sharpened resistivity boundaries which has assisted in the understanding of the d geological models and drilltarget delineation the integration of the updated and revised digital drill database and reprocessed geophysical data with the results of surface mapping and geochemical sampling has served as the basis for the creation of comprehensive d models for the southern portion of the lewis property the geological portions of the models were created through collaboration with srk consulting reno using leapfrog software in the rd quarter of  the understanding gained through the creation of these models has assisted the company in the generation of several highgrade goldsilver targets the most compelling of these targets lie in the virgin buena vista and meagher  silver structural zones in the southern part of the lewis property  exploration program a helicopterborne magnetic and radiometric survey was flown over the project environs by precision geosurveys during june  the survey covered about  km for a total of  linekm consisting of eastwest oriented flightlines spaced  m apart and northsouth tielines spaced every  m the survey was flown at a nearly constant height of  meters above the ground the magnetic results indicate zones of high magnetic intensity over known intrusions in addition these results delineate two major eastnortheasterlytrending lineaments that coincide locally with the distribution of variably claypyritealtered tertiary dikes and fracture zones these dikes and fracture zones are associated with goldsilver mineralization in the southern part of the lewis property and in the northern portion of the fortitude deposit one of the magnetic lineaments intersects and changes trend across the buena vista fault zone this magneticstructural intersection lies adjacent to the convergence of the buena vista meagher silver and theodore fault zones which will be tested by a diamond drilling program the processed images of the radiometric results show a good spatial coincidence between goldsilver bearing fault zones and radiometric gradients this is consistent with the fault juxtaposition of hostrock units that contain varying abundances of radiometric potassium thorium and uranium further details and images of the relationships between the results of the  geophysical surveys are contained in the corporate presentation and a separate report prepared by fathom geophysics both of which are included in the investor info – presentations section of the company website a groundbased gravity survey was completed over the  km lewis property in late may  by magee geophysical services for a total of  stations processing and imaging of the results indicate that some of the major goldsilverbearing fault zones coincide with gravity gradients this is due to the fault juxtaposition of rock units characterized by contrasting density specific gravity many of the gradients expressed by the gravity results coincide with gradients observed in the magnetic and radiometricresults and mapped faults the spatial coincidence of geophysical gradients with known goldsilverbearing fault zones will assist the company in targeting large and potentially wellmineralized structural zones for future exploration and drilling the collection of about  more gravity stations was accomplished in early august  with the aim to improve data resolution and the extent of coverage the relogging of diamond drillcore and reversecirculation rc chips have continued in  an additional  diamondcore holes were relogged in late may to july to bring the project total to  coreholes for about  m the relogging of rc chips recommenced in late july with plans to bring the project total to about  holes for   m the primary aims of the relogging program are to better define geology and mineralization in drillhole and improve the threedimensional geological and structural models for the project area particularly for the virgin zone the majority of the planned rc chip relogging will be completed prior to the start of diamond drilling the most compelling exploration targets delineated to date lie in the virgin buena vista and meagher  silver areas these targets will be tested by a twelvehole diamond drillprogram exceeding  meters and is scheduled to start in midaugust  many of the planned drillholes will also test geophysical gradients and anomalies attractive targets exist in the galena white  shiloh and trinity systems which are intended for drilltesting in  any additional targets generated by the recently completed geophysical programs and future soilgrid work will be advanced to the drillstage through surface mapping and geochemical sampling the gridsoil sampling of portions of the southwestern part of the claim area commenced in early august  the purpose of the survey is to further delineate the surface expression of goldbearing fault zones using a multielement geochemical approach for example previous drilling by barrick gold  in this area indicates  m at  gt au and  cu from  m in fwl hosted by skarn in the antler limestone that lies beneath the golconda thrust previous work by the company indicates that goldsilverbearing target zones contained within reactive antler sequence hostrocks beneath the golconda thrust are typically expressed by multielement anomalies in the havallah  pumpernickle formation at surface these surface anomalies are characterized by elevated arsenic bismuth lowlevel gold and silver and other pathfinder elements the grid soilsurvey will cover portions of the  km area of interest geological mapping scale and geochemical rock sampling are ongoing in the lewis property recent work has focused on the eastern portion of the claim block along a northerlytrending goldsilverarsenicbearing structural corridor that extends from the inactive iron canyon goldsilver mine in the south through the historic apex antimony mine to the antimony king mine in the north this style of mineralization is associated with northerlytrending clayaltered tertiary dikes of similar composition to those that occur in the fortitude  phoenix mine area the technical information in this website about

inc announces geophysical results from the lewis goldsilver project in nevada and increases its planned drilling program to more than  meters battle mountain gold inc the company tsxv bmg is pleased to announce recent exploration activities and plans for future work in the lewis goldsilver property which lies near the town of battle mountain in nevada highlights processing and imaging completed for recently conducted helicopterborne magnetic and radiometric survey and groundbased gravity survey over the lewis claim group and surrounding areas highgrade goldsilver drill targets localized by the intersection of steeplydipping faults and fracture zones with reactive stratigraphic units at depth the planned diamondcore drill program is now expanded to include twelve holes for a total of more than  m over the virgin buena vista and meagher target zones commencing in midaugust diamond drill contractor selected and permitting process underway the multielement geochemical gridsampling of soils in the southwestern part of the project area is planned to better delineate the surface expression of goldsilverbearing fault zones and potential drill targets at depth revised corporate presentation and new geophysical report uploaded to company website further information a helicopterborne magnetic  radiometric survey and groundbased gravity survey were completed recently over the claim area the data from these surveys have now been processed and integrated with geology and mineralization as presented in this pressrelease figures  to  and included in a new geophysical report now posted on the corporate website the company has resumed relogging of reverse circulation drillchips previously collected by madison minerals inc from  to  in the virgin zone and continues geological surface mapping in northeastern part of project area figure  the multi element geochemical soilgrid sampling of the southwestern portion of the claim area is planned to further delineate the surface expression of goldbearing fault zones surface mapping and geochemical sampling threedimensional geological modeling and imaging of titan  mt electrical results and recently acquired gravity magnetic and radiometric data have established potentially highgrade gold silver targets set out in the accompanying figures  to  the diamond drill program to test these targets will commence in midaugust at least eight mineralized zones were previously recognized in the lewis property figure  the best understood goldsilver systems to date include the virgin buena vista meagher whiteshiloh and trinity structural zones which are open along strike and at depth gold and silverbearing portions of these zones exceed  m for the virgin  m for buena vista  m for meagher  m for whiteshiloh and  m for trinity  recent geochemical sampling of these zones and new areas of mineralization indicate rockchip results of up to  gt au  gt ag  pb and  zn the locations descriptions and assay results for the rockchip data are included in previous pressreleases and a spreadsheet on the companys website under investor infopresentationslewis property rockchip database a helicopterborne magnetic and radiometric survey was flown over the project environs by precision geosurveys during june the survey covered about  km for a total of  linekm consisting of east west oriented flightlines spaced  m apart and northsouth tielines spaced every  m the survey was flown at a nearly constant height of  meters above the ground the magnetic results indicate zones of high magnetic intensity over known intrusions figure  in addition these results delineate two major eastnortheasterlytrending lineaments that coincide locally with the distribution of variably claypyrite altered tertiary dikes and fracture zones these dikes and fracture zones are associated with goldsilver mineralization in the southern part of the lewis claim group and in the northern portion of the fortitude deposit figures  and  one of the magnetic lineaments intersects and changes trend across the buena vista fault zone this magneticstructural intersection lies adjacent to the convergence zone of the buena vista meagher silver and theodore fault zones which our diamond drilling program will test figures  to  the processed images of the radiometric results show a good spatial coincidence between goldsilver bearing fault zones and radiometric gradients eg buena vista and theodore fault zones in figure  this is consistent with the fault juxtaposition of hostrock units that contain varying abundances of radiometric potassium thorium and uranium a groundbased gravity survey was completed over the  km lewis project area in late may by magee geophysical services for a total of  stations processing and imaging of the results indicate that some of the major goldsilverbearing fault zones coincide with gravity gradients eg buena vista fault zone in figures  and  this is due to the fault juxtaposition of rock units characterized by contrasting density specific gravity many of the gradients expressed by the gravity results coincide with gradients observed in the magnetic and radiometricresults and mapped faults the spatial coincidence of geophysical gradients with known goldsilverbearing fault zones will assist the company in targeting large and potentially wellmineralized structure for future exploration and drilling the most compelling exploration targets delineated to date lie in the virgin buena vista and meagher silver area these targets will be tested by a twelvehole diamond drillprogram exceeding  meters and scheduled to start in midaugust figures  to  a drilling contractor has been selected and the permitting process is underway these highgrade goldsilver targets are localized by the intersection of  descriptions of the mineralized zones and tables of drillhole assay results can be found in a  report dated march  titled amended and restated summary report  core and reverse circulation drilling program fw lewis property battle mountain mining district lander county nevada usa the   report filed on sedar under the companys profile and also on the companys website under investor infoarticles agreements and reports steeplydipping faults and fracture zones with reactive stratigraphic units at depth many of the planned drillholes will also test geophysical gradients and anomalies attractive targets also exist in the galena whiteshiloh and trinity systems which are intended for drilltesting in  any additional targets generated by the recently completed geophysical programs and future soilgrid work will be advanced to the drillstage through surface mapping and geochemical sampling plans are for the gridsoil sampling of portions of the southwestern part of the claim area figure  as described in a previous pressrelease june st  the purpose of the survey is to further delineate the surface expression of goldbearing fault zones using a multielement geochemical approach for example previous drilling by barrick gold  in this area indicates  m at  gt au and  cu from  m in fwl  hosted by skarn in the antler limestone that lies beneath the golconda thrust figure  previous work by the company indicates that goldsilverbearing target zones contained within reactive host rocks beneath the golconda thrust are typically expressed by multielement anomalies in the havallah  pumpernickle formation at surface these surface anomalies are characterized by elevated arsenic bismuth lowlevel gold and silver and other pathfinder elements the grid soilsurvey will cover portions of the  km area of interest and commence soon the lewis property consists of a  hectare  acre land position directly north of newmonts fortitude openpit mine metals production in calendar  from the fortitudephoenix operation includes  ounces of gold  million pounds of copper and byproduct silver and at december   reported reserves were  million ounces of gold  million pounds of copper and byproduct silver as indicated on page  of newmonts  annual report the lewis property consists of seven patented and  unpatented mining claims historic mining of gold silver and base metals occurred along several northerlytrending lodes in the claim group the company commenced its recent exploration of the lewis property in late june  the fieldwork completed to date consists of detailed geological surface mapping scale geochemical rock and soilsampling and relogging of diamondcore and rcchips from drillholes completed by madison minerals inc from  to  the emphasis during this work has been on the geometric controls to goldsilverand base metalbearing fault and fracture systems these target structures cut across several rock formations that have properties conducive to metals deposition including the same formations that host ore in the fortitude mine of newmont located directly to the south the six figures referred to in this pressrelease
