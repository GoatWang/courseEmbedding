cigarette the eliquid may or might not contain nicotine non smoking electronic cigarettes do not contain any trace of nicotine in them right now there are many smokers who prefer non nicotine eliquid because it has the same effect of smoking in words of water vapor and appearance but it does not contain any nicotine instead it is made up of different flavors like apple vanilla coffee peach and so on the low nicotine ecigs have the same ingredients like propylene glycol grade glycerol plant glycerin distilled water citric acid natural or unnatural flavors moreover they both release the same

eliquid in them in addition they can be used in public places like private hospitals and restaurants since no fire or combustion will take place when using them so no restriction basically the density of eliquid present in the cartridge is founded on the sort of e cig the smoker chooses a low nicotine ecig contains no nicotine low density eliquid contains  mg smoking medium density contains doze mg nicotine high denseness has  mg cigarette smoking xhigh density has twentyfour mg nicotine xxhigh occurrence has  mg cigarette smoking and xxxhigh density has  mg nicotine contrary to the real
