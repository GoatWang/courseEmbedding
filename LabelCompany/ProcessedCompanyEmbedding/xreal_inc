instead open the door to raising money from loyal early fansthe changes are the greatest advancement for entrepreneurship in a generation said ron miller a los angeles venture capitalist who as an entrepreneur had to raise capital through credit cards bank loans corporate investors and nasdaq pink sheets this is opening up a whole new opportunity thanks to the new rule which stems from the

pursue the averagejoe or averagejane investor is uncertaininitially you think this is going to be the best thing in the world said bill clark chief executive of online investment service microventures

crowdfunding platforms supporters get stocksince the jobs act passed three years ago several of those services have been able to funnel cash from wealthy investors to startups including more than  million to about  tech companies in the us according to data from tracking firm crowdneticthe number could grow rapidly now that anyone can invest the rule change goes into effect friday about three months after the securities and exchange commission completed a lengthy process to define the regulationbefore sales of private stock had been limited to people whose most recent twoyear income exceeded  hold a net worth above  million excluding their home or control more than  million in assets everyone else had been able to invest under only special conditions such as already having an established relationship with an entrepreneurthose standards were designed to protect retail investors from being duped by some of the highestrisk bets out there but they also restricted access to the biggest rewards — like a  investment in a rising social media company becoming worth  million when it goes public — to an elite groupin the tech industry the setup concentrated significant power among venture capitalists a cadre of typically older white and male investors that left out minorities women and those without relationships in the vc world miller saidrenee farris  is among the newly liberated individuals excited to invest farris a los angeles writer said she imagines investing up to  a year in environmentally responsible startupsinvesting in a company that has no track record that isnt pulling in revenue — its risky she said but theres a risk to make a lot of money tooeven though the barrier to entry has now been lowered for the public financial experts worry that the number of companies ready to endure the new rules requirements will turn out to be smallbut some startup founders are considering the opportunity because they want to spend less time fundraising via traditional channels and want access to anyone who will fork over money reaching out to the general population for capital is also appealing for startups that cater to a niche audience and have

smaller and slowergrowingurbn havn secured one major investor but needed more cash by widening the pool of potential funders to anyone with internet access the duo think they can cobble together  million from people who would then control  of urbn havnwe want to find people who understand theres a need for products like this in the world and not just the things that go mass and infinite chou said urbn havn plans to offer shares to the public through flashfunders an online equity funding platform in part because it saves startups as much as  by handling legal and finance tasks for them despite wanting to turn millennial customers into investors urbn havn decided against taking money from lowerincome individuals because of the additional coststhe sec and several states including california are debating further changes to adjust rules that hinder startups from accepting anyones cashthe concern among some lawmakers is that too much leeway will lead to fraud targeting groups

condition operating results business prospects or any other aspect of our business please be advised that our actual financial condition operating results and business performance may differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in forwardlooking statements we have attempted to identify in context certain of the factors we currently believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ from our current expectations the differences may be caused by a variety of factors including but not limited to   ·we have a limited operating history we cannot guarantee sales of our product or that we will ever be profitable and we may be unable to effectively implement our business model ·if we do not consistently deliver highquality titles or if consumers prefer competing products our sales could suffer ·our reputation with consumers is critical to our success if our games and services do not function as consumers expect it may have a negative impact on our business ·our industry is subject to rapid technological change and if we do not adapt to and appropriately allocate our new resources among emerging technologies and business models our business may be negatively impacted ·competition in the interactive entertainment industry is intense and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales ·the development of highquality products requires substantial upfront expenditures and we may not be able to recover those costs for our future products ·our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies we may also face legal risks arising from usergenerated content ·we rely on external developers to develop some of our software products ·our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of international trade ·we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could negatively impact our business ·if general economic conditions decline demand for our products could decline ·there is no current trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling or otherwise monetizing their shares we have used an arbitrary offering price     we have a limited operating history and we cannot guarantee sales of our product or that we will ever be profitable and we may be unable to effectively implement our business model the company was formed in may  and has only recently begun operations we cannot assure at this time that we will operate profitably or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due management believes that our success will depend in large part on our ability to market our games we intend to invest heavily in marketing and in the development of a new pack for fortress fury a new concept and new games as a result we will likely incur operating losses for the foreseeable future our business is speculative and dependent upon the acceptance of our proprietary games and the effectiveness of our marketing program to convince gamers to download our games on their mobile platforms and purchase the items that are making our games attractive and addictive we cannot assure that consumers will accept our proprietary games or that we will earn any revenues or profit investors may lose their entire investment if we do not consistently deliver highquality titles or if consumers prefer competing products our sales could suffer while many new products are regularly introduced in our industry it is increasingly difficult to produce highquality products and to predict prior to production and distribution what products will be wellreceived even if they are highquality titles with good reviews competitors often develop titles that could imitate or compete with our bestselling titles and take sales away from them or reduce our ability to charge the same prices we could charge for such titles products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated which could cause our product sales to fall below expectations consumers may lose interest in a genre of games we produce if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products or if our competitors develop more successful products or offer competitive products at lower prices our revenues margins and profitability could be impaired the increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks as downloadable content for poorlyreceived titles typically generates lowerthanexpected sales further a failure by us to develop a highquality product or our development of a product that is otherwise not wellreceived could harm our reputation and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be wellreceived if our games and services do not function as consumers expect it may have a negative impact on our business if our games and services do not function as consumers expect whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise our sales may suffer the risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to fortress fury our only game with online features because it involves ongoing consumer expectations which we may not be able to successfully satisfy if our games and services do not function as consumers expect it may negatively impact our business the rewriting of the matrix for a game to satisfy a higher number of players could adversely impact the game and disappoint consumers our industry is subject to rapid technological change and if we do not adapt to and appropriately allocate our new resources among emerging technologies and business models our business may be negatively impacted technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry we must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emerging technologies delivery platforms and business models in order to stay competitive if we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a new platform operating system or media format we will be required to make a substantial investment prior to the introduction of the product if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs further our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do creating products that are technologically superior to ours more appealing to consumers or both if on the other hand we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms or otherwise elect not to pursue a new business model that achieves significant commercial success it may have adverse consequences it may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology platform or business model as the case may be and may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model for example digital content delivery is increasingly important in our industry requiring us to develop or acquire the expertise in such delivery method needed to remain competitive any failure to successfully adapt to and appropriately allocate resources among emerging technologies could negatively impact our business     competition in the interactive entertainment industry is intense and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales within the interactive entertainment industry we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software developed for use on handheld mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites both within the united states and increasingly in international jurisdictions our competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater financial marketing and product development resources than we have for example integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as microsoft nintendo and sony compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms a relatively small number of titles account for a significant portion of net revenues and an even greater portion of net profit in the interactive entertainment industry the availability of significant financial resources is a major competitive factor in the production of highquality products and in the marketing of products that are ultimately wellreceived our larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial technical personnel and other resources to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful products for the personal computer pc or video game platforms than we do in addition competitors with large product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers distributors and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors more popular titles the development of highquality products requires substantial upfront expenditures and we may not be able to recover those costs for our future products consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict and even the most successful titles remain popular for only limited periods of time unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced in order to remain competitive we must continuously develop new products or enhancements to existing products the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of highquality products is increasing and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product if our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction we may not be able to recover the substantial development and marketing costs associated with those products our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies we may also face legal risks arising out of usergenerated content we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods including a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights we own or license various copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets we are not aware if unauthorized copying has occurred and if a significant amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur it could negatively impact our business policing unauthorized sale distribution and use of our products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem for our industry     we rely on external developers to develop some of our software products we rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products because we depend on these developers we are subject to the following risks a continuing strong demand for toptier developers resources combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work may cause developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable to us b limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing products or require us to fund additional costs and c a competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and in either case we would not be able to continue to engage such developers services for our products except for any period of time for which those developers are contractually obligated to complete development for us increased competition for skilled thirdparty software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers if the products subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances we would have to writeoff unrecovered portions of these payments which could negatively impact our business so far we have paid developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues from product sales less agreed upon deductions our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of international trade we conduct business throughout the world and we expect to eventually derive a substantial amount of revenues and profits from international trade we expect that international sales will account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits in the future and moreover that sales in emerging markets in asia and elsewhere will increasingly be important especially due to the growth of gaming in asia as such we are and may increasingly be subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally as well as risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets including increased tariffs and duties compliance with economic sanctions fluctuations in currency exchange rates shipping delays increases in transportation costs international political regulatory and economic developments and differing local business practices all of which may impact operating margins or make it more difficult if not impossible for us to conduct business in foreign markets we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could negatively impact our business we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within xreal and some of which are managed andor hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks malicious software security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commerciallysensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system or network failure or security breach could

delaware on august   and converted into a corporation on april   the company was established to create a new mobile gaming platform primarily targeting the esports market and to develop a mobile esports franchise with highly addictive games we are a developer and publisher of online games to be played exclusively on mobile and tablet devices we operate in the mobile esports segment of the video gaming industry and are an international developer and publisher of interactive software products and content  we develop market and sell products exclusively through digital downloads which are

to value buyers seeking budgetpriced software in a variety of markets we intend to continue to focus our efforts in the areas we believe have the most opportunity for growth and higher profitability while reducing investments in areas we believe have less profit potential and limited growth opportunities to that end we expect to focus on developing deep highquality content that offers engaging online gaming experiences     we believe the growth of video gaming as an industry reflects a growing trend among young people who play these games as a sport as such the new industry eponymously named esports has given rise to live tournaments styled as sports competitions and held in traditional theatres for sports such as the staples center in los angeles california and other similar arenas it has also given rise to professional player leagues devoted fans and followers and accouterments of traditional sports such as cards shirts and other forms of merchandising the top gaming companies benefiting from this trend include larger companies with a division focused on gaming such as microsoft and sony and also several companies focused exclusively on the gaming space the three most notable are activision blizzard inc activision ea sports inc ea sports and take two interactive inc take two we believe that almost all of the pure gaming companies have sought in one way or another to enter into the activity of live gaming tournaments as a way to promote their brands and individual games over the last several years gaming companies together with some other related groups such as major league gaming a group with a youtube network devoted to broadcasting games and the electronic sports league esl a group that styles itself as an esports league devoted to the tournament side of the business and which sponsors games from several different gaming companies have put on numerous tournaments the tournaments showcase a live competition on giant video screens with contestants in soundproof booths at major event centers  we believe the participation in esports is growing along with the growth of mobile gaming acceptance around the world w e intend to target the esports and mobile gamin g markets  both domestically and internationally with our games our plan is to c onceive develop produce and market sophisticated electronic games for play on mobile devices and in esports tournaments worldwide we will seek to monetize our games in a variety of ways from direct player fees to sale of sponsorships and advertising spots to gene r al merchandizing to promote branding   we specifically designed our first game fortress fury the game to fit both android and ios mobile consoles the game was introduced to market in  and gained many players in a short period of time an internet forum has been created by users and youtube reports in excess of  views of the various videos related to the game fortress fury has been listed in the top  on the itunes app store and was downloaded more than a million times in its first two weeks after launch in late  we decided to make a second faster improved version of the first game   we plan to address immediate needs required to support the growth of our first game especially through advertising to generate more downloads and interest in the game after it is rereleased first we intend to enhance and further develop the game with software improvements once we have adequate funds the second version is expected to have faster download and response times than the existing version our primary sources of revenue are expected initially to be the proceeds from players paying fees to play in tournaments fees paid to purchase features during game play and advertisingsponsorship revenue earned from content published on our game platform management believes that substantial revenue can be generated through the sale of access to game players management also believes that sales of advertisingsponsorship on our platform will generate an additional source of revenue for us as soon as the game has created a significant gaming community around fortress fury   in order for our strategy to work the game and subsequent games pro duced by us must become popular with c onsu mers there is no assurance that any of our games will be popular or command significant fees from players or advertisers the consumption of entertainment is discretionary and subjective and generally outside the control of its producers  our executive offices are located at  arizona avenue santa monica california  and our telephone number is  our website address is httpswwwfortressfurycom and our email address is infostartenginecom     investment analysis management believes that we have strong economic prospects by virtue of the following dynamics of the industry and us   management believes that the trends for growth in the egames industry are favorable as the demand for games is growing along with the development and acceptance of mobile platforms around the world management has already developed one game fortress fury the game was launched on may   and within two weeks after launch gained more than one million downloads including  android and  apple downloads for a total over seven million unique sessions management believes our plan to maintain and build upon our intellectual properties and franchise by developing new content and games is a winning strategy we developed and produced our first video game title using a model in which a core group of creative production and technical professionals led by our creative director in coordination with our marketing finance and other departments has responsibility for the entire development and production process including the supervision and coordination of internal and external resources management believes that our marketing efforts on the internet including on facebook twitter youtube and other online social networks and websites will provide us with a competitive advantage as we believe management has an indepth knowledge of internet marketing and youtube in particular our creative director has over nine million followers on youtube in addition our first game is already available through itunes at the apple store and google play there is no assurance that we will be profitable or that the industrys favorable dynamics will not be outweighed in the future by unanticipated losses adverse regulatory developments and other risks investors should carefully consider the various risk factors before investing in

a limited liability company in the state of delaware on august   and converted into a corporation on april   to create a new mobile gaming platform primarily targeting the esports market and develop a mobile esports franchise with highly addictive games we are a developer and publisher of online games to be played exclusively on mobile and tablet devices we operate in the mobile esports segment of

are principally based on our developed intellectual properties we are established to deliver content to a broad range of gamers ranging from children to adults and from core gamers to massmarket

profitability while reducing investments in areas we believe have less profit potential and limited growth opportunities to that end we expect to focus on developing deep highquality content that offers engaging online gaming experiences our customers play each other and compete on their mobile devices management believes that online gaming has a relatively low entry cost for consumers and will continue to develop along with the acceptance of the portable telephone around the world  we have already developed one game fortress fury the game which management believes is highly addictive the game was launched on may   and within two weeks after launch gained more than one million downloads including  android and  apple downloads for a total over seven million unique sessions this large number of downloads and unique sessions triggered technical issues with respect to the speed of interaction in the game we plan to resolve these issues upon completion of this offering with a new version of the game an important aspect of our strategy is our proprietary social media approach to marketing one of our founders is wellknown on social media with over nine million followers on youtube and other social media platforms we believe our social media approach will create visibility for our game and our xreal platform at a low entry cost to users cofounder jordan maron also known as captainsparklez is our chief creative officer and has extensive knowledge of social media and its use we believe his knowledge is invaluable and he has designed a proprietary marketing approach that we believe will allow us to compete at an advantage with larger companies that have stronger financial resources we believe our first game fortress fury is highly addictive and although a player can download and play for free we designed the game such that it only starts to become interesting and addictive when players purchase energy crystals powerups save slots xp boost and alchemist chest to win items the cost of the items for purchase is nominal less than  per item in order to entice players to buy items while focusing on proven intellectual properties is one of xreals priorities we also plan to continue to make strategic investments in developing new intellectual properties that we believe have the potential for longterm growth and success management has a defined plan to upgrade the game to increase monetization with several new features and to improve the graphics with a new look for some of the items to target high level players the first expansion pack for fortress fury which requires a rewriting of the matrix to allow large numbers of players is scheduled to be released in summer  subject to the continued work of our design team we also expect to release additional content for fortress fury in  and beyond      new features we are currently developing for the game include improving the social media aspect of the game to increase interaction between the players which we believe will contribute to a higher retention rate among players resulting in additional revenue for the company we are considering upgrading game tournaments to eventually include prizes management is also working on new weapons including a magic cannon and a missile to make the game more attractive strategy we plan to create acquire and maintain strong franchises we focus on development and publishing activities principally for products and content which are or have the potential to become franchises with sustainable mass consumer appeal and recognition it has been our experience that these products and content can then serve as the basis for sequels prequels and related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time we believe that the publishing and distribution of products and content based on proven franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits we believe we have been successful with our fortress fury franchise and we intend to continue development of owned franchises in the future the success of our publishing business depends in significant part on our ability to develop highquality games that will generate high unit volume sales our publishing unit led by our chief creative officer has implemented a formal control process for the selection development production and quality assurance of our products we apply this process which we refer to as the greenlight process to all of our products whether they are externally or internally developed the greenlight process includes regular indepth reviews of each project at important stages of development by a team that includes all members of our management and enables coordination among our sales marketing and development at each step in the process  we develop our products using a combination of our internal development resources and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select our external developers based on their track records and expertise in producing products in the same category one developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe enhances the quality of our products and accelerates the timing of releases we generally enter into a service contract through which we pay the contractor but do not share any of the intellectual property of the product being developed sometime we attach a royalty payment to a developers service contract   in the case of fortress fury the company entered into an agreement with collision studios inc a game designer pursuant to which we agreed to pay cash compensation of  plus a  royalty on net receipts in perpetuity under the development agreement with collision net receipts are calculated after deducting  of the companys costs incurred to produce the game as well as taxes  p roduct returns uncollectable sales chargebacks refunds and platform fees  for example  to apple  t he royalty applies to downloadable content within the game and expansion packs the royalty is general ly paid as the company is earning the balance of net receipts at the same time and applies only to the game and not to other subsequent games produced by the company accordingly the company can be profitable even though the net receipts royalty for collision on the game runs in perpetuity which is fairly typical in industry development agreements with outside independent developers   we believe xreal with the successful launch of fortress fury has aligned its product offerings and cost structure to position our business for longterm growth we believe we are best positioned to take advantage of digital distribution channels that allow us to deliver content to a broad range of gamers ranging from children to adults and from core gamers to massmarket consumers and to value buyers seeking budgetpriced software in a variety of geographies we believe that by offering our products for use on multiple platforms we reduce the risks associated with any single platform spread our costs over a larger installed hardware base and increase unit sales we intend to continue to offer games online with localized content in different geographies     product development and support  we plan to maintain and build upon our intellectual properties and franchise by developing new content and games xreal develops and produces titles using a model in which a core group of creative production and technical professionals led by our chief creative officer in coordination with our marketing finance and other departments has responsibility for the entire development and production process including the supervision and coordination of internal and external resources this team assembles the necessary creative elements to complete a title using where appropriate outside programmers artists animators scriptwriters musicians and songwriters sound effects and special effects experts and sound and video studios xreal believes that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise with topquality external resources on an asneeded basis  in addition xreal typically selects independent thirdparty developers based on their expertise in developing products in a specific category for specific platforms each of our thirdparty developers is under contract with us either for a single or multiple titles  marketing sales and distribution  xreals marketing efforts primarily include activities on the internet including on facebook twitter youtube and other online social networks and websites and public relations as well as industry promotions our first game is available through itunes at apple store and google play in addition our game contains software that enables customers to electronically register with us online especially to participate in tournaments which then allows us to connect with our gamers directly  we believe that our fortress fury franchise will generate a loyal and devoted customer base that will continue to engage with the game and purchase additional content as a result of their dedication to the game and satisfaction from previous product purchases we therefore plan to market additional content including sequels expansion packs and downloadable content toward our established customer base as well as to broader audiences  an important aspect of our marketing is based on the personality of our chief creative officer jordan maron who has a significant social media presence with at least nine million followers and subscribers on youtube under the brand name captainsparklez digital distribution online and digital distribution channels are continuing to grow and comprise a significant part of our business most of our products and content are sold in a digital format which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their handheld mobile or tablet device anywhere in the world in addition our products can be purchased from apple itunes and google play  manufacturing xreal prepares a set of master program copies documentation and packaging materials for our products for each hardware platform on which the product will be released this work is done inhouse by our internal team both apples and googles technical teams review our documentation prior to release of our games and various contents     intellectual property we regard our games game names and similar intellectual property as critical to our success we have already applied for a trademark for fortress fallout serial no  and we plan to register additional trademarks in the future we will also rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization we currently do not hold any registered copyrights pertaining to intellectual property surrounding the game in addition others may independently develop substantially similar intellectual property although we may pursue the registration of our trademarks copyrights and patents in the united states effective trademark copyright and patent protection may not be available or may not be sought by us in every country in which our products are made available online from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our intellectual proprietary rights and those of others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business short term plan of operation during the next twelve months we intend to concentrate our efforts on three main activities a improving fortress fury b developing and expanding our social media presence and c developing sequels to fortress fury management estimates that cost of improvement of the game with the creation of new various packs matrix rewriting extensions and sequels will require an entire designer team to work for several months management intends to dedicate approximately  toward product development costs in addition the companys creative department anticipates spending approximately  to create new games and concepts that will complement our existing franchise with respect to marketing the development of a larger social media presence is a priority for the company and management intends to invest approximately  in advertising and public relations on social media platforms including facebook youtubegoogle and instagram and by attending trade shows and other marketing events the balance of the net proceeds raised in this offering will be used for working capital purposes  beyond this offering of  of common stock management expects that operations will allow us to reach breakeven in the event acceptance of the game by the esports community does not occur or takes longer than projected we will not reach breakeven after the completion of this offering through operations and may have to raise additional capital which would cause additional dilution to the companys shareholders  the market we believe that adoption of smartphones and tablets has led to a dramatic shift in media engagement on these platforms seventeen percent of films music and television shows are now watched on mobile phone or tablets we believe video viewing habits are evolving rapidly not just in mature markets but globally and especially among younger audiences millennials esports is targeting and designed for millennials postmillennials and even generation x millennials are generally considered people aged  to  postmillennials are the next generation after millennials sometimes referred to as generation z generation x is an alternative designation for what used to be referred to as the baby boomers people born after the postworld war ii baby boom the global esports market is  in our view experiencing robust growth which we expect to continue north america and europe make up a combined  of the market as they continue to invest rapidly in the space while asia is largely dominated by china as viewership grows we believe pro players and teams will reach celebrity status more than a third of american esports fans choose which tournaments to watch based on whether their favorite teams or players are competing      we believe that more than a third of esports fans in the united states participate in online amateur tournaments we believe publishers hope to make mobile esports the next frontier we believe the success of hearthstone heroes of warcraft has caused mobile publishers like super evil megacorp creator of vainglory to develop mobile games specifically for competitive gaming we believe mobile esports seek to capitalize on new opportunities by accessing a wider gamer audience and extending player longevity mobile titles like hearthstone and vainglory appear to be challenging the traditional presence of consoles and pcs we expect that touchscreen esports will be several times larger than the pc esports opportunity since smart devices are continuing to penetrate the gaming world as it is cheaper and does not require an expensive console or software in addition we believe the tactile mechanics of these games will extend the lifetimes of players since unlike twitch games games dependent on player reaction time they do not require quick reflexes that diminish with age the company is offering a free download of fortress fury making it an easy entry for players  we believe that brands often have difficulty reaching male millennials which accounts for most of the esports demographic new sponsors like soylent however are beginning to take advantage of this booming market in fall  soylent a leader in nutritionallycomplete staple foods partnered with esl one of the worlds largest esports companies for the esl esea pro league season and esl one at new york super week event at madison square garden the event sold  seats in less than five minutes we believe this is a good illustration of the excitement generated by this industry  competition the mobile esports industry is intensely competitive we expect competition to intensify further in the future barriers to entry are relatively low current and new competitors can launch new products and can compete in the marketplace we currently compete or potentially will compete with a number of other companies whose numbers will increase in the future many of which are larger and possess greater human and capital resources than we possess we compete with other video game companies and with providers of different forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online casual entertainment and music for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with global operations and greater financial resources than we have we also face competition from other video game companies and large media companies to obtain license agreements for the right to use some of the intellectual property included in our products primary competitive factors important to us include game quality and ease of use compatibility of products with certain platforms online capability price marketing and quality of customer service  competition in games for console devices and pcs we compete directly with sony and microsoft each of which develops and publishes software for its respective console platform we also compete with numerous companies which like us develop and publish video games that operate on these consoles on pcs but also on mobile and handheld platforms these competitors include but are not limited to activision blizzard taketwo interactive and ubisoft another significant company in the gaming space is the valve corporation but valve which was started by two former microsoft employees has chosen to remain private and financial data on valve is not readily available valve is reported by market data companies as being successful all of these companies have strong financial and human resources diversified media companies such as disney and warner bros also are involved in software game development and publishing     competition in games for mobile devices the marketplace for mobile games particularly freetodownload mobile games is characterized by frequent product introductions rapidly emerging new mobile platforms new technologies new mobile application storefronts and thousands of game offerings as the penetration of mobile devices that feature fullyfunctional browsers and additional gaming capabilities continues to deepen the demand for applications continues to increase and there are more mobile application storefronts through which developers can offer products mobile game applications currently are offered by a wide range of competitors including but not limited to supercell king gungho online and hundreds of smaller companies we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and promote competing applications by among other things establishing a presence in geographic regions in which they did not operate previously as a result we expect competition in the mobile entertainment market to continue to intensify government regulation we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet in addition laws and regulations relating to user privacy data collection and retention content advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world legislation is continually being introduced and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place that may affect the way in which we and other industry participants may offer content and features and distribute and advertise our products for example privacy laws and regulatory guidance in many countries impose various restrictions on online and mobile advertising as well as the collection storage and use of personally identifiable information we may be required to modify certain of our product development processes or alter our marketing strategies to comply with such regulations which could be costly or delay the release of our products in addition many foreign countries such as china and germany have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict the content or advertising of interactive entertainment software or prohibit certain types of content further legislation which attempts to restrict marketing or distribution of such products because of the content therein has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the united states there is ongoing risk of enhanced regulation of interactive entertainment marketing content or sales these laws and regulations vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions the adoption and enforcement of legislation which restricts the marketing content or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products and the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be limited failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in governmentimposed fines or other penalties moreover the increased public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers willingness to purchase our products employees as of march   we had two parttime employees our officers upon the completion of this offering we intend to retain our officer employees on a full time basis we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend in large measure on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees      property we currently lease approximately  square feet of office space at  arizona avenue santa monica california  for  per month pursuant to a month to month lease with an affiliate of our chief executive officer we plan to commence a month to month lease at the same location but in a suite with more office space for rent of  per month commencing on july    seasonality our operations may be materially affected by seasonality our industry is known for being highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand and a significant percentage of sales occurring in the holiday season quarter ending in december and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter ending in june since our game was introduced in may  we do not yet have one full year of historical operation we expect however to experience a similar sales trend but there can be no assurance that this trend will continue our results can also vary based on a number of factors including title release dates cancellation or delay of a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied consumer demand for our products shipment schedules content offerings and revenue recognition policies risk factors the purchase of shares of our common stock involves substantial risks each prospective investor should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to any other risks associated with this investment and should consult with his own legal and financial advisors cautionary statements the discussions and information in this offering circular may contain both historical and forwardlooking statements to the extent that the offering circular contains forwardlooking statements regarding the financial condition operating results business prospects or any other aspect of our business please be advised that our actual financial condition operating results and business performance may differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in forwardlooking statements we have attempted to identify in context certain of the factors we currently believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ from our current expectations the differences may be caused by a variety of factors including but not limited to adverse economic conditions lack of market acceptance of our fortress fury franchise and other franchises failure to develop new content and games inability to develop and expand our social media presence unrecoverable losses from theft intense competition including entry of new competitors falling demand for our games adverse federal state and local government

     risks related to our business and industry we have a limited operating history we cannot guarantee sales of our product or that we will ever be profitable and we may be unable to effectively implement our business model the company was formed in may  and has only recently begun operations we cannot assure at this time that we will operate profitably or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due management believes that our success will depend in large part on our ability to recommence the marketing of our games we intend to invest heavily in marketing and in the development of a new pack for fortress fury a new concept and new games as a result we will likely incur operating losses for the foreseeable future our business is speculative and dependent upon the acceptance of our proprietary games and the effectiveness of our marketing program to convince gamers to download our games on their mobile platforms and purchase the items that are making our games attractive and addictive we cannot assure that consumers will accept our proprietary games or that we will earn a profit we cannot assure that we will earn any revenues or that investors will not lose their entire investment we cannot guarantee sales of our product or that we will ever be profitable our business is speculative and dependent upon the acceptance of our proprietary games and the effectiveness of our marketing program to convince gamers to download our games on their mobile platforms and to purchase additional items we plan to offer in order to make our games more attractive and addictive we cannot assure that consumers will accept our proprietary games or that we will earn any revenues or profit xreal cannot assure that investors will not lose their entire investment we may be unable to implement our business model effectively our business model is predicated on our ability to introduce to market our proprietary games we cannot assure that we will be able to execute our business plan introduce new games into the marketplace or make our games addictive enough such that consumers purchase the additional items that would create revenue for our company in the event customers resist paying the prices for additional items projected in our business plan or to adopt our games especially our first game our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected  we currently have only two parttime employees at the company who presently allocate limited time to the companys business due to insufficient capital the company currently has limited managerial resources which impairs its ability to execute its business plan until the company is adequately capitalized to enable its officers to devote more time to the company and to hire additional personnel it will operate at a relatively slow pace  if the proceeds of this offering are not sufficient the company will seek alternative sources of capital of which there is no assurance   if we do not consistently deliver highquality titles or if consumers prefer competing products our sales could suffer while many new products are regularly introduced in our industry it is increasingly difficult to produce highquality products and to predict prior to production and distribution what products will be wellreceived even if they are wellreviewed highquality titles competitors often develop titles that could imitate or compete with our bestselling titles and take sales away from them or reduce our ability to charge the same prices we could charge for such titles products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated which could cause our product sales to fall below expectations consumers may lose interest in a genre of games we produce if we do not continue to develop consistently highquality and wellreceived products or if our competitors develop more successful products or offer competitive products at lower prices our revenues margins and profitability could be impaired the increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks as downloadable content for poorlyreceived titles typically generates lowerthanexpected sales further a failure by us to develop a highquality product or our development of a product that is otherwise not wellreceived could harm our reputation and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be wellreceived     our financial performance is partly driven by the success of our fortress fury franchise in the firstperson action game category we believe that xreal is a global developer publisher and distributor in the firstperson action game category primarily due to the initial popularity of xreals fortress fury franchise revenues from the fortress fury franchise comprise a significant portion of our consolidated revenues at this stage to remain a player in the firstperson action game category it is important that we continue to develop new games in the fortress fury franchise that are favorably received by both our existing consumers and new consumers a number of software publishers have developed and commercialized or are currently developing firstperson action games which pose a threat to the popularity of fortress fury and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the firstperson action category if consumer demand for fortress fury games declines and we have not introduced new firstperson action games or added other sources of revenue or if consumer preferences trend away from firstperson action games it could negatively impact our business  transitions in console platforms could adversely affect the market for interactive entertainment software nintendo introduced its nextgeneration console the wii u in  and sony and microsoft each launched its nextgeneration console the ps and xbox one respectively in november  we are developing and publishing games for handheld and mobile platforms only when new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software products for prior console platforms in anticipation of purchasing a new platform and products for that platform platform transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable content amplifying the impact on our revenues as a result our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during platform transitions than during other times we believe that mobile and handheld devices are protected from new platforms but we cannot anticipate public perception our business is highly dependent on the success timely release and availability of new video game platforms and on the continued availability of and support for existing video game platforms as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on platforms manufactured by third parties apple and samsung the success of our business is driven in large part by our ability to predict accurately which platforms will be successful in the marketplace our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms the availability of an adequate supply of these mobile platforms and the continued support for these platforms by their manufacturers we do not believe than apple or samsung have any intention of changing their operating platforms but we are dependent on their ability to continue to grow negative consumer perceptions about our brands games services or business practices may damage our business and any costs incurred in addressing consumer concerns may increase our operating expenses individual consumers form our ultimate customer base and consumer expectations regarding the quality performance and integrity of our products and services are high consumers may be critical of our brands games services or business practices for a wide variety of reasons these negative consumer reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively actions we take to address consumer concerns may be costly and in any case may not be successful in addition negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups as well as litigation which regardless of their outcome may be damaging to our reputation any of these may have a negative impact on our business  if our games and services do not function as consumers expect it may have a negative impact on our business if our games and services do not function as consumers expect whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise our sales may suffer the risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to fortress fury our only game with online features because it involves ongoing consumer expectations which we may not be able to satisfy in the initial launch of the game play volume was high and the responsiveness of certain features was slower than expected while we plan to release an improved version there is no assurance that its launch will be successful if our games and services do not function as consumers expect it may negatively impact our business the rewriting of the matrix to satisfy a higher number of players of the game could negatively impact the game and the expectations from consumers     the future success of our business depends on our ability to release popular products in a timely manner the life of any given console or handheld game product is relatively short and generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after the products introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because revenues associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations it is therefore important for us to continue to develop many highquality new products that are popularly received and to release those products in a timely manner if we are unable to continue to do so it may negatively impact our business  if we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our titles our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity could suffer materially if we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our titles whether due to competitive pressure because retailers elect to price competitive products at a lower price or otherwise it could have a negative impact on our business  if we fail to successfully manage our new product development or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with that development it may negatively impact our business our business model is evolving and we believe that our growth will depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop and sell new types of products developing new products requires substantial upfront expenditures further forecasting our revenues and profitability for new business modeling is inherently uncertain and volatile if such products do not achieve expected acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction whether because of competition or otherwise we may not recover the cost of our investments in developing and marketing those products or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels in addition expanding our business model will add complexity to our business and require us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and different requirements of any new areas in which we operate which we may not be able to do for lack of institutional expertise or otherwise   our current rewards based crowdfunding campaign may lower future revenue temporarily by giving away game coins to investors in this offering we are conducting a rewards based crowdfunding campaign to raise funding by offering free game coins to investors in this offering to the extent that players invest in the shares they will be given free game coins that they otherwise would have had to purchase from the company for money potentially lowering future revenue    our industry is subject to rapid technological change and if we do not adapt to and appropriately allocate our new resources among emerging technologies and business model our business may be negatively impacted technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry we must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emerging technologies delivery platforms and business models in order to stay competitive if we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a new platform operating system or media format we will be required to make a substantial investment prior to the introduction of the product if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs further our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do creating products that are technologically superior to ours more appealing to consumers or both if on the other hand we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms or otherwise elect not to pursue a new business model that achieves significant commercial success we may suffer adverse consequences it may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology platform or business model as the case may be and may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model for example digital content delivery is increasingly important in our industry requiring us to develop or acquire the expertise in such delivery method needed to remain competitive any failure to successfully adapt to and appropriately allocate resources among emerging technologies could negatively impact our business     the increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to risks including greater competition all of our revenue is currently derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition since the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game particularly a new game for the emerging mobile platform may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console therefore the barrier to entry is low digital delivery of our products requires us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if any of this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity  if we are unable to successfully develop or market our intellectual property we may publish fewer successful titles and our revenues may decline so far our products are based on intellectual property that we have developed internally or with outside assistance from third parties consumers have historically preferred titles which are part of established franchises as opposed to titles based on new intellectual property if a new intellectual property does not gain consumer acceptance whether because we are unable to successfully create consumer appeal and brand recognition or for other reasons our business could be negatively impacted further if the popularity of our owned intellectual property declines we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets and revenues and operating income from these intellectual properties may decline quickly either of which could negatively impact our business  competition in the interactive entertainment industry is intense and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales within the interactive entertainment industry we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software developed for use on handheld mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites both within the united states and increasingly in international jurisdictions our competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater financial marketing and product development resources than we have for example integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as microsoft nintendo and sony compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms a relatively small number of titles account for a significant portion of net revenues and an even greater portion of net profit in the interactive entertainment industry the availability of significant financial resources is a major competitive factor in the production of highquality products and in the marketing of products that are ultimately wellreceived our larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial technical personnel and other resources to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful products for the pc or video game platforms than we do in addition competitors with large product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers distributors and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors more popular titles     increased consumer acceptance and availability of a interactive entertainment developed for use by consumers on handheld mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites or other online games b technology which allows users to play games on televisions without consoles or c technological advances in online game software for the internet could result in a decline in sales of our platformbased software we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities for example the overall growth in the use of the internet and online services such as social networking sites by consumers may pose a competitive threat if consumers and potential consumers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the internet including those online services further it is difficult to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities failure to adequately identify and adapt to the competitive pressures described herein could negatively impact our business  the development of highquality products requires substantial upfront expenditures and we may not be able to recover those costs for our future products consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict and even the most successful titles remain popular for only limited periods of time unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced in order to remain competitive we must continuously develop new products or enhancements to existing products the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of highquality products is increasing and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product if our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction we may not be able to recover the substantial development and marketing costs associated with those products we are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the yearend holiday buying season in the fourth quarter of the year as a result our sales should be highest during the second half of the year receivables and credit risk should likewise be higher during the second half of the year delays in development licensor approvals or manufacturing can affect the timing of the release of products causing us to miss key selling periods such as the yearend holiday buying season  if our proprietary online game service does not function properly our business may be negatively impacted if fortress fury does not function as anticipated xreals games may be completely unavailable or we may be prevented from delivering content digitally which could result in a loss of sales further any disruption in fortress fury services could negatively impact our business  we may be subject to intellectual property claims as the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap software developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims it is also possible that fortress fury which we believe utilizes complex cuttingedge technology may become subject to emerging intellectual property rights of others although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties may still claim infringement particularly since there are an increasing number of companies that focus their efforts exclusively on enforcing their patent rights      further intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following   ·cease selling incorporating supporting or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property    ·obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property which if available at all may not be available on commercially favorable terms    ·redesign the affected interactive entertainment software products which could result in additional costs delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial appeal of the affected products or    ·pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements our products may be subject to legal claims in prior years lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies by the families of victims of violence alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence these lawsuits have been dismissed but similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would cover such risks in the future or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor further any such lawsuit could result in increased governmental scrutiny harm to our reputation reduced demand by consumers for our products or decreased willingness by our customers to purchase or by our partners to provide marketing support for those products such results could divert development and management resources increase legal fees and other costs and have other negative impacts on our business  we may be involved in legal proceedings that may result in material adverse outcomes from time to time we may be involved in claims suits government investigations audits and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business including actions with respect to intellectual property competition privacy matters tax matters labor and employment matters unclaimed property matters compliance and commercial claims such claims suits government investigations audits and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services requiring us to change our development process or other business practices  our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies we may also face legal risks arising out of usergenerated content we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods including a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights we own or license various copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets we are not aware if unauthorized copying has occurred and if a significant amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur it could negatively impact our business policing unauthorized sale distribution and use of our products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem for our industry the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or are poorly enforced legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries in addition though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale distribution and use of our products more difficult and to otherwise enforce and police our rights as do the manufacturers of mobile phone and handheld tablets on which our games are played our efforts and the efforts of the mobile operators may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products in all instances the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used in our products the availability of broadband access to the internet the refusal of internet service providers to remove infringing content in certain instances the ability to download pirated copies of games from various internet sites and peertopeer networks and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy we also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies      we rely on external developers to develop some of our software products we rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products because we depend on these developers we are subject to the following risks a continuing strong demand for toptier developers resources combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work may cause developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable to us b limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing products or require us to fund additional costs and c a competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and in either case we would not be able to continue to engage such developers services for our products except for any period of time for which those developers are contractually obligated to complete development for us increased competition for skilled thirdparty software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers if the products subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances we would have to writeoff unrecovered portions of these payments which could negatively impact our business so far we have paid developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues from product sales less agreed upon deductions our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of international trade we plan to conduct business throughout the world and we expect to derive revenues and profits from international trade we expect that international sales will account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits in the future and moreover that sales in emerging markets in asia and elsewhere will be increasingly important especially due to the growth of gaming in asia as such we are and may increasingly be subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally as well as risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets including increased tariffs and duties compliance with economic sanctions fluctuations in currency exchange rates shipping delays increases in transportation costs international political regulatory and economic developments and differing local business practices all of which may impact operating margins or make it more difficult if not impossible for us to conduct business in foreign markets a deterioration in relations between either us or the united states and any country in which we have significant operations or sales or the implementation of government regulations in such a country including china in particular could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions including economic sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity for example to operate in china certain games must have regulatory approval a decision by the chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in china in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity additionally in the past legislation has been implemented in china by which local authority can require modifications to any game and other software the future implementation of similar laws or regulations in china or any other country in which we have operations or sales may require engineering modifications to our products that are not costeffective if even feasible at all or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products in addition cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of titles that are popular in the united states or require us to modify the content of the games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games in order to be successful if we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products or if the other risks discussed herein come to fruition it could negatively impact our business      changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in our business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income could be materially adversely affected  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity we transact business in various currencies other than the us dollar and could have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks a substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies including certain major currencies such as the euro british pound and emerging market currencies such as the south korean won and chinese renminbi which could fluctuate against the us dollar since we anticipate significant international sales but incur the majority of our costs in the united states the impact of foreign currency fluctuations particularly the strengthening of the us dollar may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business there can be no assurance we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks  our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies policies affecting revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we report revenues related to our products and services  we may permit our customers to return products and to receive pricing concessions which could negatively impact our business we are exposed to the risk of product returns we may permit product returns from or grant price protection to our customers under certain conditions  if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our consumers our business could be negatively impacted our products are expected to be marketed through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our consumers particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods or advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a negative impact on our business      our business products and distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content in key territories if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity could be materially adversely affected legislation is continually being introduced and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place that may affect the way in which we and other industry participants may offer content and features and distribute and advertise our products for example privacy laws and regulatory guidance in many countries impose various restrictions on online and mobile advertising as well as the collection storage and use of personally identifiable information we may be required to modify certain of our product development processes or alter our marketing strategies to comply with such regulations which could be costly or delay the release of our products in addition many foreign countries such as china and germany have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict the content or advertising of interactive entertainment software or prohibit certain types of content further legislation which attempts to restrict marketing or distribution of such products because of the content therein has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the united states there is ongoing risk of increased regulation of interactive entertainment marketing content or sales these laws and regulations vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions the adoption and enforcement of legislation which restricts the marketing content or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be limited failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in governmentimposed fines or other penalties moreover the increased public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers willingness to purchase our products  data breaches involving the source code for our products or customer consumer or employee data stored by us or by a third party operating on our behalf could negatively impact our business in the course of our daytoday business we and third parties operating on our behalf may create store and use commercially sensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our interactive software products and confidential information with respect to our customers consumers and employees a malicious intrusion by hackers or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets account information including personally identifiable information and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software fraudulent activity disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers consumers or employees personally identifiable information or our own sensitive business data if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other costs including from the implementation of additional security measures or suffer reputational damage moreover even if there were a public perception that our data protection measures are inadequate whether or not the case it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships in addition we may be subject to legal claims or proceedings in connection with data security breaches including regulatory investigations and actions  we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could negatively impact our business we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within xreal and some of which are managed andor hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks malicious software security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commerciallysensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system or network failure or security breach could negatively impact our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell and host our content online we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches     our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comment in real time that is visible to other players from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter  we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand in the event of a significant decline in demand for one or more of our products we may not be able to reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disrupting our operations or incurring costs further we may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenues and profit moreover costreduction actions may decrease our employee morale and result in the failure to execute upon our business plan due to the loss of employees or impact our ability to retain or recruit key employees in addition any such action may involve the risk that our senior managements attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations  catastrophic events may disrupt our business our corporate headquarters and our primary corporate disaster center are located in the los angeles california area which is near a major earthquake fault a major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations could require significant expenditures to resume operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain further our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities any such event could also limit the ability of retailers distributors or customers to sell distribute or purchase our products  if general economic conditions decline demand for our products could decline our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail as a result our products are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles a reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in our selling and promotional expenses in an effort to offset that reduction and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations profitability cash flows and liquidity the uncertainty of worldwide economic conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult we are unable to predict worldwide economic conditions and all of the effects those conditions may have on our business in particular the uncertainty of future worldwide economic conditions subjects our forecasts to heightened risks and uncertainties      financial projections included with this offering circular may prove to be inaccurate financial projections concerning our estimated operating results may be included with the offering circular any projections would be based on certain assumptions which could prove to be inaccurate and which would be subject to future conditions which may be beyond our control such as general industry conditions we may experience unanticipated costs or anticipated revenues may not materialize resulting in lower operating results than forecasted we cannot assure that the results illustrated in any financial projections will in fact be realized by us  directors and officers have limited liability our bylaws provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our officers and directors against claims arising from our activities to the maximum extent permitted by nevada law if we were called upon to perform under our indemnification agreements then the portion of our assets expended for such purpose would reduce the amount otherwise available for our business if we were to lose the services of our key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy our success is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees the loss of any of our officers or directors would have a material adverse impact on us we will generally be dependent upon howard marks and jordan maron for the direction management and daily supervision of our operations if we do not continue to attract and retain skilled personnel we will be unable to effectively conduct our business we believe one of our most essential assets is our employees and as such our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify hire retain and utilize the abilities of qualified personnel particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the highquality wellreceived titles upon which our business is substantially dependent the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical marketing sales engineering product development creative and management skills we may have difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so if we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the services of key personnel it could have a negative impact on our business  risks relating to our common stock if we issue additional shares of our stock shareholders may experience dilution in their ownership of us we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock par value  per share and  shares of preferred stock par value  per share we have the right to raise additional capital or incur borrowings from third parties to finance our business our board of directors has the authority without the consent of any of our stockholders to cause us to issue more shares of our common stock and preferred stock consequently shareholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of us in the future our board of directors and majority shareholders have the power to amend our certificate of incorporation in order to effect forward and reverse stock splits recapitalizations and similar transactions without the consent of our other shareholders we may also issue net profits interests in xreal the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or net profits interests by us would dilute shareholders ownership in us we cannot assure that we will pay dividends we do not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to our shareholders in the near future it is our current intention to apply net earnings if any in the foreseeable future to increasing its capital base and marketing prospective investors seeking or needing dividend income or liquidity should therefore not purchase shares of our common stock we cannot assure that we will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock and in any event a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors     our common stock would be subject to the penny stock rules of the securities and exchange commission if it were publicly traded and may be difficult to sell our shares of common stock are penny stocks because they are not registered on a national securities exchange or listed on an automated quotation system sponsored by a registered national securities association pursuant to rule aa under the exchange act for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks and that the broker or dealer receives from the

stock a disclosure schedule prescribed by the securities and exchange commission relating to the penny stock market which sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and that the broker or dealer received a signed written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction generally brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities

be aware that according to sec release no  the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse such patterns include   ·control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer    ·manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases    ·boiler room practices involving highpressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons    ·excessive and undisclosed bidask differential and markups by selling brokerdealers and    ·the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of brokerdealers who participate in the market management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our shares of common stock the occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price     we cannot assure that a public

industry regulatory authority finra of which there is no assurance before active trading of our common stock could commence if our shares of common stock ever publicly trade they may be relegated to the otc pink sheets the otc pink sheets provide significantly less liquidity than the nasds automated quotation system or nasdaq stock market prices for securities traded solely on the pink sheets may be difficult to obtain and holders of common stock may be unable to resell their securities at or near their original price or at any price in any event except to the extent that investors shares may be registered on a form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in the future of which there is absolutely no assurance no shares could be sold under rule  or otherwise until we become a current public reporting company with the securities and exchange commission or otherwise are current in our business financial and management information reporting and applicable holding periods have been satisfied even if a market develops for our shares our shares may be thinly traded with wide share price fluctuations low share prices and minimal liquidity if a market for our shares develops the share price may be volatile with wide fluctuations in response to several factors including potential investors anticipated feeling regarding our results of operations increased competition and our ability or inability to generate future revenues in addition if our shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board or otc market overthecounter our share price may be affected by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance our share price might be affected by general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rates commodity prices or international currency fluctuations in addition even if our stock is approved for quotation by a market maker through the otc stocks traded over this quotation system are usually thinly traded highly volatile and not followed by analysts these factors which are not under our control may have a material effect on our share price  state securities laws may

employer as well as trustees and fiduciaries of keogh plans under which employees in addition to selfemployed individuals are participants together erisa plans are governed by the fiduciary responsibility provisions of title  of the employee retirement income security act of  erisa an investment in shares by an erisa plan must be made in accordance with the general obligation of fiduciaries under erisa to discharge their duties i for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries ii with the same standard of care that would be exercised by a prudent man familiar with such matters acting under similar circumstances iii in such a manner as to diversify the investments of the plan unless it is clearly prudent not do so and iv in accordance with the documents establishing the plan fiduciaries considering an investment in the shares should accordingly consult their own legal advisors if they have any concern as to whether the investment would be inconsistent with any of these criteria     fiduciaries of certain erisa plans which provide for individual accounts for example those which qualify under section k of the code keogh plans and iras and which permit a beneficiary to exercise independent control over the assets in his individual account will not be liable for any investment loss or for any breach of the prudence or diversification obligations which results from the exercise of such control by the beneficiary nor will the beneficiary be deemed to be a fiduciary subject to the general fiduciary obligations merely by virtue of his exercise of such control on october   the department of labor issued regulations establishing criteria for determining whether the extent of a beneficiarys independent control over the assets in his account is adequate to relieve the erisa plans fiduciaries of their obligations with respect to an investment directed by the beneficiary under the regulations the beneficiary must not only exercise actual independent control in directing the particular investment transaction but also the erisa plan must give the participant or beneficiary a reasonable opportunity to exercise such control and must permit him to choose among a broad range of investment alternatives limited transactions trustees and other fiduciaries making the investment decision for any qualified retirement plan ira or keogh plan or beneficiaries exercising control over their individual accounts should also consider the application of the prohibited transactions provisions of erisa and the code in making their investment decision sales and certain other transactions between a qualified retirement plan ira or keogh plan and certain persons related to it eg a plan sponsor fiduciary or service provider are prohibited transactions the particular facts concerning the sponsorship operations and other investments of a qualified retirement plan ira or keogh plan may cause a wide range of persons to be treated as parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect to it any fiduciary participant or beneficiary considering an investment in shares by a qualified retirement plan ira or keogh plan should examine the individual circumstances of that plan to determine that the investment will not be a prohibited transaction fiduciaries participants or beneficiaries considering an investment in the shares should consult their own legal advisors if they have any concern as to whether the investment would be a prohibited transaction special fiduciary considerations the department of labor issued new regulations in  conferring fiduciary duty on certain professionals such as investment advisors and possibly brokerdealers who render advice to and earn compensation from erisa plans iras keogh plans and similar statutory retirement programs the regulations include new disclosure rules relating to compensation and conflicts of interest   regulations issued on november   by the department of labor the final plan assets regulations provide that when an erisa plan or any other plan covered by code section  eg an ira or a keogh plan which covers only selfemployed persons makes an investment in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the investment company act of  the underlying assets of the entity in which the investment is made could be treated as assets of the investing plan referred to in erisa as plan assets programs which are deemed to be operating companies or which do not issue more than  of their equity interests to erisa plans are exempt from being designated as holding plan assets management anticipates that we would clearly be characterized as an operating company for the purposes of the regulations and that it would therefore not be deemed to be holding plan assets classification of our assets of as plan assets could adversely affect both the plan fiduciary and management the term fiduciary is defined generally to include any person who exercises any authority or control over the management or disposition of plan assets thus classification of our assets as plan assets could make the management a fiduciary of an investing plan if our assets are deemed to be plan assets of investor plans transactions which may occur in the course of its operations may constitute violations by the management of fiduciary duties under erisa violation of fiduciary duties by management could result in liability not only for management but for the trustee or other fiduciary of an investing erisa plan in addition if our assets are classified as plan assets certain transactions that we might enter into in the ordinary course of our business might constitute prohibited transactions under erisa and the code     reporting of fair market value under code section i as amended by the tax reform act of  ira trustees must report the fair market value of investments to ira holders by january  of each year the service has not yet promulgated regulations defining appropriate methods for the determination of fair market value for this purpose in addition the assets of an erisa plan or keogh plan must be valued at their current value as of the close of the plans fiscal year in order to comply with certain reporting obligations under erisa and the code for purposes of such requirements current value means fair market value where available otherwise current value means the fair value as determined in good faith under the terms of the plan by a trustee or other named fiduciary assuming an orderly liquidation at the time of the determination we do not have an obligation under erisa or the code with respect to such reports or valuation although management will use good faith efforts to assist fiduciaries with their valuation reports there can be no assurance however that any value so established i could or will actually be realized by the ira erisa plan or keogh plan upon sale of the shares or upon liquidation of us or ii will comply with the erisa or code requirements tax aspects the income earned by a qualified pension profit sharing or stock bonus plan collectively qualified plan and by an individual retirement account ira is generally exempt from taxation however if a qualified plan or ira earns unrelated business taxable income ubti this income will be subject to tax to the extent it exceeds  during any fiscal year the amount of unrelated business taxable income in excess of  in any fiscal year will be taxed at rates up to  in addition such unrelated business taxable income may result in a tax preference which may be subject to the alternative minimum tax it is anticipated that income and gain from an investment in the shares will not be taxed as ubti to tax exempt shareholders because they are participating only as passive financing sources terms of the offering securities offered we are offering

august   inception in the state delaware the companys headquarters are located in santa monica california  the company is in the online gaming business and intends to build a mobile esports franchise with a highly addictive game in addition to its current offering the financial statements of xreal inc which may be referred to as xreal the company we us or our are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap subsequent to year end as disclosed in note  xreal llc was converted to xreal inc a delaware corporation the historical financial statements included herein are those of xreal llc in subsequent reporting periods the financial statements will reflect the capital structure of the corporation from that of a limited liability company the company operates in a rapidly changing technological market and its activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to further exploit the companys current development note  – summary of signfiicant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could materially differ from these estimates  going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business  to date the company has not generated meaningful revenues from principal operations and we have sustained losses since inception costs are expected to exceed revenues in the near term as we develop more games these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued management reviewed various factors including availability of capital from current members and third parties expected future revenue and development costs industry trends and current and historical operating costs  we determined that in the near term the companys members have the ability and intent to continue to fund the business and product development as they have since inception in addition there is a high degree of interest from third parties to raise significant capital through a regulation a tier  securities offering reg a offering based on the companys testing the waters campaign and only minimal costs are required to continue to operate the company between periods of product development accordingly management concluded their plans for liquidity are sufficient to alleviate substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these efforts the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   f  fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the companys assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value  level    observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel    include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplacelevel    unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity the fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value fairvalue estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of december   and  the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values these financial instruments include cash and accounts payable fair values for these items were assumed to approximate carrying values because of their short term in nature or they are payable on demand  concentration of credit risk the company maintains its cash with a major financial institution located in the united states of america which it believes to be credit worthy  balances are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to    cash and cash equivalents for purpose of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents software development costs the company applies the principles of asc  softwarecosts of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed asc  asc  requires that software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development be charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements as well as direct costs incurred internally under our current practice of developing new games the technological feasibility of the underlying software is not established until substantially all product development and testing is complete which generally includes the development of a working model prior to a products release if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable we expense the amounts as part of cost of sales during the year ended december   and the period from inception to december   no software development costs were capitalized    f  advertising the company expenses the cost of advertising and promotions as incurred advertising costs charged to operations were approximately  and  in  and  respectively revenue recognition we operate our games as live services that allow players to play for free within these games players can purchase virtual goods to enhance their gameplaying experience through widely accepted payment methods within their apple itunes or google play account  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement the service has been provided to the player the collection of our fees is reasonably assured and the amount of fees to be paid by the player is fixed or determinable for purposes of determining when the service has been provided to the player we have determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying player to continue displaying the purchased virtual goods within the online game over their estimated life or until they are consumed consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action common characteristics of consumable goods may include virtual goods that do not provide the player any continuing benefit following consumption or often times enable a player to perform an ingame action immediately for the sale of consumable virtual goods we recognize revenue as the goods are consumed which approximates less than one month as of december   and  any amounts that may require deferral of revenue were inconsequential due to the insignificant revenue derived during december  principal agent considerations in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition principal agent considerations we evaluate our digital storefront in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal or as an agent when selling our games which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net we primarily use digital storefronts for distributing our smartphone games key indicators that we evaluate in order to reach this determination include   ·the terms and conditions of our contracts with the digital storefronts    ·whether we are paid a fixed percentage of the arrangements consideration or a fixed fee for each game transaction    ·the party which sets the pricing with the enduser has the credit risk and provides customer support and    ·the party responsible for deliveryfulfillment of the product or service to the end consumer based on the evaluation of the above indicators we have determined that we are generally acting as a principal and are the primary obligor to endusers for smartphone games distributed through digital storefronts therefore we recognize revenue related to these arrangements on a gross basis when the necessary information about the gross amounts or platform fees charged before any adjustments are made available to us by the digital storefronts income taxes the company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes consequently federal income taxes are not payable or provided for by the company members are taxed individually on their pro rata ownership share of the companys earnings   f  gaap basis of accounting requires management to evaluate tax positions taken by the company and disclose a tax liability or asset if the company has taken an uncertain position that more than likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities management has analyzed the tax positions taken by the company and has concluded that there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require disclosure in the financial statements the company is subject to routine audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities generally for three years after the tax returns are files however there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress the  tax year was the first year that

percentage of the arrangements consideration or a fixed fee for each game transaction ·the party which sets the pricing with the enduser has the credit risk and provides customer support and ·the party responsible for deliveryfulfillment of the product or service to the end consumer based on the evaluation of the above indicators we have determined that we are generally acting as a principal and are the primary obligor to endusers for smartphone games distributed through digital storefronts therefore we recognize revenue related to these arrangements on a gross basis when the necessary information about the gross amounts or platform fees charged before any adjustments are made available to us by the digital storefronts  software development costs the company applies the principles of asc  softwarecosts of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed asc  asc  requires that software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development be charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements as well as direct costs incurred internally under our current practice of developing new games the technological feasibility of the underlying software is not established until substantially all product development and testing is complete which generally includes the development of a working model prior to a products release if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable we expense the amounts as part of cost of sales      part iii – exhibits item  index to exhibits  certificate of incorporation and certificate of conversion  bylaws subscription documents  posting agreement with
