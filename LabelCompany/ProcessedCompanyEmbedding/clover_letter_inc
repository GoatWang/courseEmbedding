page sec staff noaction letter clover capital management inc pub avail october   securities and exchange commission washington dc  october   response of the office of chief counsel division of investment management our ref no cc clover capital management inc file no  your letter of june   requests our assurance that we would not recommend any enforcement action to the commission under rule a of the investment advisers act of  act if clover capital management inc clover a registered investment adviser uses investment results derived from a model portfolio in advertisements hereinafter model results as described more fully in your letter the model portfolio was established by clover on january   and consists of the same securities that clover recommended to clients during that time period as your letter notes clovers investment approach incorporates the philosophy that all of its clients should invest in the same securities with variances in specific client objectives being addressed via the asset allocation process ie the relative weighting of stocks bonds and cash equivalents in each account thus while the model results do not correspond directly to the results achieved by any actual client account clover has managed the model portfolio with the same investment philosophy it uses for client accounts because of the significant degree of interest in this issue and in the related issue of advisers using actual investment results of client accounts under management in advertisements hereinafter actual results we wish to take this opportunity to set forth the staffs views on these issues section  of the act prohibits certain transactions by any investment adviser whether registered or exempt from registration pursuant to section b of the act under paragraph  of section  the commission has authority to adopt rules defining acts practices and courses of business that are fraudulent deceptive or manipulative pursuant to this authority the commission adopted rule  which defines the use of certain specific types of advertisements by advisers as fraudulent deceptive or manipulative although the rule does not specifically prohibit an adviser from using model or actual results or prescribe the manner of advertising these results paragraph  of the rule makes it a fraudulent deceptive or manipulative act for any investment adviser to distribute directly or indirectly any advertisement that contains any untrue statement of a material fact or that is otherwise false or misleading accordingly the applicable legal standard governing the advertising of model or actual results is that contained in paragraph  of the rule ie whether the particular advertisement is false or misleading the staff no longer takes the position as it did a number of years ago that the use of model or actual results in an advertisement is per se fraudulent under section  and the rules thereunder particularly rule a rather this determination is one of fact and we believe the use of model or actual results in an advertisement would be false or misleading under rule a if it implies or a reader would infer from it something about the advisers competence or about future investment results that would not be true had the advertisement included all material facts any adviser using such an advertisement must ensure that the advertisement discloses all material facts concerning the model or actual results so as to avoid these unwarranted implications or inferences because of the factual nature of the determination the staff as a matter of policy does not review any specific advertisements therefore we express no opinion regarding your proposed advertisements in order to assist advisers who advertise model or actual results we wish to take this opportunity to set forth certain advertising practices the staff believes are inappropriate under rule a the list is not intended to address all advertising practices prohibited by rule a and does not create a safe harbor that may be relied upon by an adviser as an exclusive list of the factors that must be considered in determining the type of disclosure necessary when advertising model or actual results items  below apply to both model and actual results items  apply to model results and item  applies to actual results in the staffs view rule a prohibits an advertisement that model and actual results  fails to disclose the effect of material market or economic conditions on the results portrayed eg an advertisement stating that the accounts of the advisers clients appreciated in the value  without disclosing that the market generally appreciated  during the same period  includes model or actual results that do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees brokerage or other commissions and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid  fails to disclose whether and to what extent the results portrayed reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings  suggests or makes claims about the potential for profit without also disclosing the possibility of loss  compares model or actual results to an index without disclosing all material facts relevant to the comparison eg an advertisement that compares model results to an index without disclosing that the volatility of the index is materially different from that of the model portfolio  fails to disclose any material conditions objectives or investment strategies used to obtain the results portrayed eg the model portfolio contains equity stocks that are managed with a view towards capital appreciation  fails to disclose prominently the limitations inherent in model results particularly the fact that such results do not represent actual trading and that they may not reflect the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on the advisers decisionmaking if the adviser were actually managing clients money  fails to disclose if applicable that the conditions objectives or investment strategies of the model portfolio changed materially during the time period portrayed in the advertisement and if so the effect of any such change on the results portrayed  fails to disclose if applicable that any of the securities contained in or the investment strategies followed with respect to the model portfolio do not relate or only partially relate to the type of advisory services currently offered by the adviser eg the model includes some types of securities that the adviser no longer recommends for its clients  fails to disclose if applicable that the advisers clients had investment results materially different from the results portrayed in the model actual results  fails to disclose prominently if applicable that the results portrayed relate only to a select group of the advisers clients the basis on which the selection was made and the effect of this practice on the results portrayed if material we wish to emphasize that  it is the responsibility of every adviser using model or actual results to ensure that the advertisement is not false or misleading  the list set forth above of advertising practices the staff believes are prohibited by rule a is not intended to be allinclusive or to provide a safe harbor and  the staff as a matter of policy will not review specific advertisements as we agreed this response will be made public immediately thomas p lemke chief counsel  rule b generally defines an advertisement to include any communication addressed to more than one person that offers any investment advisory service with regard to securities  for example rule  prohibits an adviser from using advertisements that include testimonials paragraph a or that refer to past specific recommendations unless certain information is provided paragraph b the staff is currently reviewing rule  to determine whether it needs to be revised or updated see investment advisers act rel no  aug    as a general matter whether any advertisement is false or misleading will depend on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding its use including  the form as well as the content of the advertisement  the implications or inferences arising out of the advertisement in its total context and  the sophistication of the prospective client see eg covato lipsitz inc pub avail oct  covato edward f okeefe pub

inc pub avail sept    with respect to model results the staff recognizes that advisers may wish to advertise model results derived from model portfolios that differ in form and structure from that presented by your letter we believe that to the extent it is more difficult to verify or objectively test the criteria underlying the model portfolio in question the disclosure obligation of the adviser would correspondingly increase  see eg covato supra note   see eg okeefe supra note  clover capital management inc  tobey village office park pittsford new york    june   mr thomas p lemke chief counsel division of investment management securities  exchange commission  th street nw washington dc  dear mr lemke clover capital management inc is an investment counseling firm registered with the sec under the investment advisors act of  i have enclosed a copy of a letter we recently received from mr frank morrison of the secs new york city office informing us that our use of a model portfolio for tracking the firms investment record violates rule  a in a subsequent telephone conversation with mr dolan an associate of mr morrisons we were made aware that your office has the authority to rule on such matters on a casebycase basis and to issue no action letters where warranted please consider our case based on the following information  clover capital management inc is an investment management firm founded in october  by michael e jones cfa and geoffrey rosenberger cfa we had several very successful years experience as investment analysts and portfolio managers at the firm of manning and napier advisors inc in starting our new firm we were faced with the dilemma of providing prospective clients with an understanding of our prior and current investment results and style of management in dealing with this problem we aspired to maintain the highest possible ethical standards thus we have not represented our previous firms record as our own or as an indication of clover capital managements ability we have choosen to forego discussion of our specific results on clients prior to forming clover capital however as you know the issue of demonstrating the firms competence and style of management is important in presenting our service to prospective clients our problem is to find a way to show what we are doing in our research and management effort at clover capital management inc without violating client confidentiality and without misrepresenting our performance to the public one approach to this problem involves presenting the performance achieved among our account base however the securities markets have been quite volatile in the past  months and our client based has grown consistently each month as a result a portfolio that started in january  has different results than one we began in september  to take an arithmetic average of each clients actual results and present that as the firms track record would be misleading due to the significant standard deviation from client to client based on date of entry to our firms management on the other hand to just pick one or two client portfolios would be equally misleading because of differences in the timing of cash flows specific client objectives and other considerations which may be unique to a small sample of accounts we recognized at the outset that this would be the case we also recognized this presentation of results would not satisfy questions on portfolio construction and investment style with respect to diversification portfolio beta asset allocation and related items the raw results would also be impossible to verify without violating client confidentiality the most accurate verifiable reflection of our true investment product in light of these circumstances was to establish a model portfolio as of january   which we would manage exactly as we would a taxexempt client portfolio with no restrictions as to income and without any cash flow into or out of the fund  the securities purchased and sold in the model portfolio are also purchased and sold in our client accounts under management at the time of the transaction it is important to note that our investment approach incorporates the philosophy that all of our clients should own the same stock selections with variances in specific client objectives being addressed via the asset allocation process the relative weightings of stocks bonds and cash equivalents in each account for example when we make a decision to invest in a common stock we also decide what percentage of each clients assets we wish to commit to that particular equity differences in client objectives are reflected in the weightings placed for each account most of our accounts are tax exempt retirement funds with conservative objectives and therefore receive similar weightings however some clients have differing objectives due to current income requirements moral considerations tax considerations equities only restrictions and other factors which may alter the weightings in specific investments the model portfolio weightings are determined according to its stated hypothetical structure as a conservative pension fund  we have taken extensive steps to insure that the reporting format is an objective one the independent accounting firm of davie kaplan  braverman was hired to audit our efforts in this effort to place a purchase or sale transaction we call davie kaplan  braverman prior to the  am market opening all transactions are assumed to occur at the prior days closing price as listed in the wall street journal which davie kaplan  braverman can easily verify commissions are charged against each transaction based on a  discount from the cowen  co commission schedule which is roughly the same commission expense level we incur in our client accounts investment management fees are also charged against the portfolio in line with our standard client fee schedule  in addition to monitoring the purchase and sale transactions in the model portfolio davie kaplan  braverman also accounts for the dividend and interest income commission charges and investment management fee reimbursement in the portfolio the quarterly investment performance reports are also compiled and issued by davie kaplan  braverman not by clover capital management inc there is a measure of independence and objectivity to our model portfolio report and its calculations which may be lacking in the investment performance figures reported by other investment management firms  we feel it is important that prospective clients see how the investment returns being presented to them were achieved use of the model portfolio allows people to see what stocks we hold and what the recent transaction activity in the account has been they can develop a feel for our investment style that would otherwise be difficult to achieve prior to entering into a relationship with our firm  the only reference the report makes to investment results is on an absolute return basis the report only records a percentage increase in asset value it makes no comparisons to any stock or bond market indexes we believe that for the above reasons our model portfolio report provides an excellent proxy for our investment approach and track record however we also understand the commissions concern about the potential for misunderstanding of the models purpose on the part of the public therefore we are willing to incorporate the following statement or a similar version which you may prefer into our report the clover capital management inc model portfolio represents a fictional account which clover capital management inc ccm attempts to manage in a manner similar to that of a taxexempt client fund with no need for special portfolio considerations the investment objective for this portfolio over a four year time period is to exceed by at least  the compound annual rate of return available on a treasury note with a four year maturity and at the same time to limit volatility in such a way as to avoid the incurrance of a negative return during any calendar year it is ccms intention to own the same securities in each client portfolio with similar objectives securities transactions will not be undertaken in the model portfolio until at least half the existing accounts under management have completed the contemplated transaction however circumstances such as market fluctuations may exist which may prevent an individual ccm client from owning one or more of the specific securities held in the model portfolio since the account is fictional there can be no assurance that a ccm client would have achieved similar rates of return over the same time frame in addition since the time period in question is a historical one there can be no assurance that future results achieved by the firms clients will in any way resemble those represented by the model portfolio we believe that use of the model portfolio is the most valid approximation we can provide a prospective client as to what our investment activity has been since january   while no form of investment performance measurement is entirely without fault of all those available to us this approach is the one which provides the least amount of bias we therefore respectfully request that you confirm that you will not recommend enforcement action if we continue to use the model portfolio in the manner stated in this letter and with the explanatory and disclaimer language found in the enclosed model portfolio copy your assistance in this matter is most appreciated if you have any questions please call either me or michael e jones at  sincerely clover capital management inc by geoffrey rosenberger president

usc §a fda approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective furthermore because these products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to selfdiagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners adequate directions cannot be written so that a layman can use them safely for their intended uses thus the labeling of lymphaid astragalus pau d arco yellow dock violet sheep sorrel blood build red clover yellow dock and immunaid fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses causing the products to be misbranded under section f of the act  usc §f the introduction of these products into interstate commerce is a violation of section a of the act  usc § a dietary supplement cgmp violations  even if the products listed above did not have therapeutic claims which make them drugs your dietary supplement products are adulterated based on the following significant

or examinations as required by  cfr aiia specifically you relied on a supplier’s coa for the component b used in all dietary supplement products you manufacture and distribute however you were unable to provide documentation for the qualification of your supplier for this component and you stated that you were unaware that you were required to establish the reliability of the supplier’s coa prior to using the component in the manufacture of your dietary supplement products      your letter dated  is inadequate because you failed to address the qualification of your supplier’s coas for the component b used in the manufacture of all of your dietary supplement products you failed to establish a specification for any point step or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record as required by  cfr a specifically your firm is conducting organoleptic andor macroscopic examination on all components labels and finished products however you did not provide any documentation to show that you have established specifications your master manufacturing records for your lymphaid bldbuild and immunaid products did not include specifications for each point step or state in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement consequently since you failed to establish specifications it is not possible for you to determine whether your examinations of components

ingredient for each batch size  cfr a specifically your mmr for your lymphaid product indicated a yield of b oz however a review of your batch production record with the date b indicated a yield of boz you indicated that you had increased the amounts of each dietary ingredient used to make a bigger batch but you did not prepare a mmr for the larger batch size you failed to include an accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used  cfr c specifically your mmr for your bldbuild product indicates the addition of boz of the raw ingredient “nettles” however your mmr does not indicate whether the ingredient is to be added in dried or liquid form you indicated to our investigators that you vary the amount of nettles in your finished product based on the availability of each form you do not prepare a unique formulation for the use of dry herbs versus liquid extract or a combination of the two to assure that each batch of finished product is uniform likewise your mmrs for your immunaid and lymphaid products call for specified amounts of ingredients but do not specify the form and you indicated that you vary the form and amounts routinely you failed to include the identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the supplement facts label  cfr d specifically you routinely use the ingredient watercress in your bldbuild product and watercress is listed on your product label however your mmr does not indicate watercress in the formulation of the product similarly the ingredient licorice or licorice root is listed in your immunaid mmr and is used in your immunaid product however you indicated that this ingredient was used as a substitute for turkey tail mushroom which is listed on your immunaid

records that are now in use however as you did not submit the revised batch record nor did you submit any documentation to show that you are now using this revised template for batch records we have found your response to be inadequate misbranded dietary supplements  your mistletoe and burdock root dietary supplement products are misbranded under section  of the act  usc §  because they do not
