lmi aerospace joining me on the call today from lmi is cliff stebe chief financial officer welcome to our first quarter  conference call we are here to discuss our press release issued earlier this morning and i will give you an update on where our efforts will be spent in the near term the first quarter of  reflects many of the transitions we have started to refine our business going forward and i believe these changes will positively affect our results over the long term as many of you are aware i took over as ceo of lmi aerospace on march   since i have joined the company i have focused on evaluating the factors key to our longterm growth and success i have spent my first  weeks touring each of lmis manufacturing sites and immersing myself in the business i have met with many of lmis strategic customers and suppliers i am excited about the future of both the company and the industry as a whole we currently find ourselves in a robust commercial aircraft production cycle with multiple new aircraft expected to be introduced to the market later in the decade we believe our recent acquisitions which expand the companys capabilities will position ourselves for new opportunities as we continue on in  we will carry out the actions necessary to support the focus areas we laid out in the press release our leadership team will continue evaluating and refining our strategy and organizing our team to ensure that our resources are aligned with the execution of that strategy we look forward to sharing that information with you later this year we must accelerate the integration of our aerostructures business to realize the full benefits and synergies we have put a team in place to oversee each specific project and ensure the improvements we expect are measurable and achieved in a timely manner cost reduction is critical to improve our competitive position in the marketplace the items we discussed in the press release certainly are some of the tools we are using we have placed significantly more emphasis in these areas since i joined lmi and we are looking across the entire organizations for ways to improve our results the steps we have already taken to remove cost from the organization should provide savings of over  million and provide significant benefit in the future we are targeting an additional  million in cost savings beyond those reductions also the closure of our fort worth texas plant and savannah machining center are now substantially complete we will continue driving efforts towards centers of excellence throughout the organization quality in delivery will remain a fundamental focus as our ability to meet our commitments and customers needs is vital to our success we plan to partner with our major customers to find new and creative solutions designed not only to lower cost but to optimize the end product by analyzing the entire value stream process were also seeing new opportunities to work with our critical aerospace customers we are working through the proposal process on numerous areas of potential new business and opportunities to grow revenue in the future finally we must develop the future leadership in employees of lmi by providing our people with the opportunities to refine and improve their skills we see a tremendous amount of talent in the organization and i am confident that we can further enhance our capabilities so id now like to have cliff stebe to speak with you in more detail about the results reported this morning cliff clifford c stebe thanks dan good morning everyone ill discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter and address how they impact the financial statements for lmi just to set the stage weve now owned the valent and tass acquisitions for over a year now and it will no longer be discussed separately except in relation to integration and acquisition expenses that affect comparability in the quarter overall we generated  million in revenue and had a net loss of  million or  per diluted share that compares to  million in revenue and  million of net income or  per fully diluted share in the first quarter of  first quarter  results included a  million in charges for restructuring activities  in expenses related to integration activities and  from other nonrecurring project costs at the facilities being closed pretax income for the first quarter of  excluding those nonrecurring items was  million first quarter  results included  million in cost associated with the step up of acquired inventories and  million in integration and acquisition expenses the positive aspect of the first quarter was that we generated  million of free cash flow which was used to pay down our debt this was the second quarter in a row that we generated positive free cash flow we expect this trend to continue in  as we continue to put pressure on working capital levels and receive further payments for design build and tooling programs implement inventory reduction processes at our plants and reduce capital spend i will start with the aerostructures group results aerostructures generated  million of revenue down  from  million in the prior quarter the decrease was entirely driven by a  million reduction in tooling sales on a development program from the first quarter of  we do expect to see tooling sales ramp back up later in  large commercial aircraft was up  at  million from  million in the prior year we saw growth in the boeing  program of  million and growth of  million in the boeing  model these increases were offset with the boeing  which was down  million and  model which was down  as compared to last years quarter sales of military products were down  we generated  million in the quarter compared to  million in the quarter last year the driver here was nearly  million decline on black hawk a combination of lower demand and some price reductions aerostructures gross margin was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in the first quarter of  first quarter of  results were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned nonrecurring project costs at facilities being closed coupled with lower plant utilization at those same facilities we also incurred startup costs on transferred productions to other facilities the decrease in sales volume primarily relating to tooling unfavorable sales mix and lower production levels contributed to the decline in gross margin and gross margin percentage in the first quarter of  expected performance on longterm contracts which we talked a tremendous amount about at year end was stable from the previous quarter  at the end of  sga for the aerostructures group was  million compared to  million in the prioryear quarter due to increases of  million of restructuring expenses  million of professional services offset by decreases of  million in integration expenses and  million in acquisition expenses shifting now to engineering services during the first quarter total revenue was  million compared to  million in the prioryear quarter the decline was largely driven by a decline in sales to corporate and regional jet aircraft manufacturers and military customers we have seen stability in engineering services in the first quarter as both sales and operating profit improved from the fourth quarter of  corporate and regional aircraft had sales of  million in this quarter down  from  million in the first quarter of  although we continue to support the bombardier learjet  project the program is maturing and fewer resources were needed in the quarter which led to a  million decline in revenue from  million in the first quarter of  on the military side sales were down  million to  million in the first quarter of  compared to  the decrease was primarily a result of a  million reduction in the boeing tanker program as the program design phase is winding down we did see growth in large commercial aircraft which was  million up from  million last year due to growth on the airbus a platform and a nacelle system project another bright spot was a  increase in mro services in addition sales related to design delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial aircraft were up  million at  million in the first quarter compared to  million in the same quarter of  this was an area of business development focus for the engineering group as several large design programs have slowed down and theyve seen some success for their efforts in this area for the engineering services group despite weaker revenue in the first quarter of  gross profit percentages improved to  in  versus  in the first quarter of  gross margin in dollars remained relatively flat at  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in quarter   the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of better labor efficiencies and utilization in addition to reductions in overhead expenses sga for the engineering services group was  million or  of net sales compared to  million or  of net sales in the prioryear quarter the reduction of sga expenses relates to cost reduction activities and integration interest expense was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the first quarter of  as discussed last year  at the end of last year on income taxes we established a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our  and as a result our tax benefit for the quarter was  of our pretax loss compared to  in quarter   we should have minimal income tax expense or benefit recognized in future quarters due to the valuation allowance we have established at the end of  next ill talk a bit about cash we generated operating cash flow of  million in the quarter  in the first quarter of  as compared to the use of cash of  million in quarter   this was entirely driven by the  million milestone payment on design build program this was offset by growth in receivables with other customers and deferring additional inventory cost and development programs net cash used for investing activities was  million in the quarter as compared to  million in the first quarter of last year in  we had spent capital expenditures on a large development program we used the cash generated in the first quarter of  to pay down  million of debt one last note we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of the end of the first quarter of  we are in the midst of working on a new capital structure for the company that we hope to complete during the second quarter to give us the flexibility we need to make the investments and changes in the business necessary to grow the company for the long term additionally we will be filing our q later today that is a look at the numbers and ill turn it back over to dan daniel g j korte thanks cliff our focus on customer satisfaction has always been a hallmark of lmis culture and values we believe that execution in the key areas we discussed earlier will not only enable us to better satisfy our customers needs but will also position the company to achieve continued growth and success in the years to come weve generated some positive momentum in a number of these areas in the past few weeks and we are committed to ensure those actions continue we have much still to do but we have started to put the plans in place that we see as critical to the future of the business with that kevin we are ready for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from sam pearlstein of wells fargo samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division in the top of your release you talked about significant new work on the max i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and tell us a little bit about how your content compares to the ng and kind of related is there anything you have to spend in terms of either development or capex that we should be thinking about clifford c stebe sam this is cliff hope youre doing well this  content is a new award for us that we had previously mentioned in our fourth quarter release its about  per ship set we have  are still in negotiations with customers relative to finalizing the potential to carry over our existing legacy work on the   from the ng to the max samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division okay and then just generally can you talk about the restructuring plan you mentioned that the actions to date ph savings of about  million and youve got other actions that could save another  million how much more needs to be expensed and really in what periods should we be thinking about those expenses hitting daniel g j korte yes were  i mean were trying to get the bulk of those savings in this year some of them may carry into  were putting the plans in place for each and every one of those items but were very early in the process right now and quite frankly were not done yet were still looking for other areas of opportunity as well but thats weve identified at this point in time in the first  weeks here that weve been tackling it samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division but can you size what the total expenses would be in terms of what youve identified todate clifford c stebe can you repeat that again sam i think you broke up a little bit samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division the expenses that are going to flow through the income statement like this quarter you had some restructuring charges can you size what kind of spending were going to see for the actions youve already identified clifford c stebe i think until we finalize our full plans relative to this i would say its likely in excess of  million but i wouldnt say dramatically higher than that samuel j pearlstein  wells fargo securities llc research division okay and then last question and ill turn it over the black hawk decline you mentioned pricing and volume im assuming the pricing stays here but  is there any reason to think why the volume should start to stabilize is it just a quarter phenomenon or is it longer term clifford c stebe the pricing concessions really began in the first quarter of last year but were not fully in effect so those have been there for the better part of the last  quarters i think at this point from what we see in the remainder of the year i think stabilizations should be pretty likely on the black hawk program operator our next question comes from yair reiner of oppenheimer yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division so you mentioned in the press release that you need to start investing more in new technology and in automation can you just give us a sense of what that implies in terms of maybe the type of capex youll need to invest going forward daniel g j korte yes were still looking at the areas that we think automation may help i mean we see some areas for instance in some of our manufacturing areas with processes like polishing and other things that are  have pretty good payback  cost benefit payback to use some level of automation again its just  theres a number of business cases that were trying to pull together here its not across the board but we see  do see good opportunities to put in some key areas some real labor intensive areas of our business some automation that will not only lower cost  but we think will also help our customers help drive some quality improvement in our endtoend processes yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division got it and i guess is this part of  i imagine this is part of the motivation behind trying to recapitalize as you mentioned in the prepared remarks and with respect to that is it going to be debt or is there a possibility that youll have to  or youll want to raise some equity as well clifford c stebe at this point we are not considering the equity path daniel g j korte and to your point the cost reductions that we see out there  i just want to iterate again i think were pretty early in that process weve identified a couple of them right now but the other reason to have the additional financing in place is were looking at some other major programs for some of our customers that would require broader capital investments and we need to have the flexibility to be able to make those investments as well so its not just about cost reduction its also about new business opportunities yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division got it okay thats helpful and then the commentary suggested that youve really been spending quite a bit of time on the cost side of the equation and on the margin side of the equation i imagine that you are beginning ph to put equal amount of effort on the outward facing efforts to try to identify new business opportunities and development opportunities with that in mind what still needs to happen before you feel comfortable enough about the top line in your expense structure to be able to guide again daniel g j korte i think key to that is the analysis were doing on our overall strategy i mean it is looking at all the markets we serve and what are the market opportunities but its also the questions that were asking ourselves about how we want to participate in each of those individual markets and we are not  after  weeks weve started to have some good hard questions but were not through that analysis yet yair reiner  oppenheimer  co inc research division if you had to guess right now do you expect guidance to be reinstated some time in  or do you think its better to think of that as  event daniel g j korte i dont think were ready to make an assessment yet on when well be ready to offer guidance again but understand we are going to try to get through this as quickly as we can but some of the questions are pretty deep and meaty questions and we want to do it right so were  although were trying to move quickly we also want to do the job well operator our next question comes from myles walton of deutsche bank myles a walton  deutsche bank ag research division so the first one on  maybe on the cost structure dan the  million indiscernible to get cost savings out of the organization i imagine those indiscernible on the aerostructures side but can you parse it that way between aerostructures and engineering services and then can you give us some perspective on engineering services now that youve seen that business kind of in the role you are today where you see it sitting within the overall organization going forward daniel g j korte the cost reductions we talked about are across both the aerostructures and the services business the bulk of them are on the aerostructures side theres been a lot of cost reduction done on the services side over the last couple of quarters in fact i think youll see  as cliff mentioned we see some stabilization and some better margins starting to emerge from that business its an easier business model to drive cost reduction out of quickly because its primarily rightsizing the headcount for the business that you have on the aerostructures side it takes a bit longer some of them are much more complicated and so i think it is a mix of both but more weighted towards the aerostructures side did you have ph the second half of your question there that i may have missed myles so myles a walton  deutsche bank ag research division i did it was more of the strategic fits of the two businesses within lmi now that youre in the role daniel g j korte yes i mean thats part of the work that were still doing were looking at the design build strategy the market analysis the size of that market the competitive forces in that particular market and thats probably one of the meatier questions that were analyzing right now as a team so but im real happy to see that for the near term at least the business has stabilized i think weve come pretty close to matching our headcount to the revenue a little bit more work to go and weve actually seen a bit of uptick in the marketplace over the last quarter so thats good while were continuing our strategic analysis myles a walton  deutsche bank ag research division okay and then one other one  its still on the same kind of vein the  million in cost plan is that a plan that rightsizes the cost structure of aerostructures to get it back to the ebit performance margins it was in  and  or was that just a period of time when you had mature programs that were kind of clicking along and its going to be hard to get back there even with your  million cost savings daniel g j korte well its  we have  product mix always has a big effect on margins but i will say just putting aside for a moment what the end target should look like i dont feel the  million is enough yet i feel theres more opportunity to drive cost out of the organization and its  yes wed like to see our margins improve but its also  just trying to run the most efficient business we can and so were very very focused on it cliff do you want to add anything there clifford c stebe yes i would just say the valent acquisition  and im hesitant to continue to talk about that the margin in those businesses were not the same as those in legacy aerostructures so to get back to the   given those margins are historically closer to  is  would be very challenging and i dont see us getting there in the near term myles a walton  deutsche bank ag research division okay and one cleanup one for you cliff which is on interest expense run rate is this the right run rate now prior to the capital structure move and then under your contemplated scenarios kind of whats the most likely interest rate is it going to be looking at convertibles and maybe having a lower interest rate run rate or is it  going to see a rate higher and the higher interest rate  interest expense run rate clifford c stebe i think youre going to see a higher run rate myles we are really  the type of capital structure were looking at we want minimal if any covenants and would like a tremendous amount of more flexibility to run the business and make the investments in the business that we believe are necessary for the longterm viability of the company and to grow this thing so youll see interest expense tick up upon closure of the deal operator im not showing any further questions in the queue mr korte id like to turn the call back over to you daniel g j korte okay thank you kevin and thanks to everyone for attending today im really looking forward to my first full quarter with the company after  weeks here i think i can see either the opportunities that we have the capabilities of the organization and by the next quarter we look forward to sharing more with you on the progress weve made on the key focus areas that weve had so we look forward to speaking to all of you on our next call thank you again operator ladies and gentlemen

gilbertson operator good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by welcome to the lmi aerospace third quarter  conference call operator instructions this call includes forwardlooking statements including statements related to lmis outlook for  and beyond these forwardlooking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from these statements these risks and uncertainties are detailed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and our other filings with the sec these forwardlooking statements are based on managements expectations as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any of these statements our presentation also includes certain nongaap financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors our gaap results and reconciliations of nongaap to gaap measures can be found in our earnings press release at this time i would like to turn the conference over to dan korte ceo mr korte please begin daniel g j korte thank you howard and good morning everyone welcome to our third quarter  conference call im dan korte ceo of lmi aerospace as howard mentioned joining me on the call today from lmi is cliff stebe chief financial officer were here to discuss our third quarter results starting with an update on what weve accomplished since the last time we spoke well also review our ongoing areas of focus and provide commentary on our corporate strategy the third quarter results include the impact of several initiatives designed to improve our business going forward and i believe these changes should positively affect our results over the long term first we continue to focus on margin improvement initiatives and achieve strong accomplishments since the last time we spoke we successfully lowered the price of externally purchased content and negotiated new pricing for engineering changes on a  program converting it from an unprofitable contract into a profitable contract the teams focus on driving down working capital levels also helped us generate a record  million in operating cash during the quarter allowing us to pay down nearly  million of debt as we make progress delevering our balance sheet in addition we continue to win new content on the  program and finally related to our initiative to further remove operating costs increase asset utilization and improve our competitive position we announced earlier today the closure of our st charles missouri machining operations formerly a valent location the work at this site will be largely transferred to other lmi facilities and were also shifting some work between other sites as we transition the company to more focused efficient centers of excellence we expect between  million and  million in nonrecurring restructuring and relocation costs associated with these transfers but this will yield over  million in annual savings once implemented these decisions are never easy but we believe it is in the best interest of the company and our customers to make these changes we are truly thankful for all the hard work and dedication to lmi by the employees impacted finally we continue to make good progress negotiating several additional longterm customer agreements and hope to have those completed by our next earnings call within the next quarter at the same time given the outlook within our aerospace end markets we see a large number of new business development opportunities and are working diligently to put lmi in a position to capitalize on this potential new work now moving to our current market environment we have seen several industry developments since our last earnings call that will positively impact lmi in the future for example gulfstream recently unveiled  new aircraft the g and g and lmi has secured contracts to provide structural assemblies skin and components for both platforms we have continued to build upon our longstanding relationship with gulfstream and have been awarded over  of content on each of these platforms more content than we have on any other gulfstream platform today the g and g have a wider cabin higher speed and better fuel efficiency then the g when they move into production over the coming years they should certainly improve our revenue trajectory and longterm profitability in addition we are pleased to announce that a key milestone was achieved on the companys first major designbuild program with the rollout of the mitsubishi regional jet which includes our tailcone i was still thrilled to be present at this significant event in nagoya japan and excited to be moving into the next phase of this program we saw another major milestone in relation to the embraer kc military transport plane which had its rollout celebration on october  in brazil lmi designed and build all the flat assemblies for this aircraft finally we saw boeing announce another gold rate increase on the  for  and that will certainly benefit lmi going forward before turning the call over to cliff i wanted to spend some time talking about our refined corporate strategy our team put significant effort in determining the longterm goals for lmi and developing an operational plan to achieve them we have set as our overriding mission to provide the best solutions to our customers with a focus on operational excellence in the production of components and assemblies our goals are to substantially grow revenue by winning  major business development awards each year delivering annual gross margin improvement delevering the balance sheet to strengthen our financial flexibility and enable further investment and integrate our operations into more efficient value streams the key to doing all of this is operational excellence which comes through improved performance superior customer service continuous people development and technology and innovation we see countless opportunities in this market for lmi and expect this to continue given the strength of the aerospace cycle we will pursue increased content across all our key customers and also seek to further penetrate airbus which represents an entire section in to market where we have barely begun to scratch the surface were focused on trying to find new awards that will benefit  as we see only modest revenue growth in  as the majority of our large wins dont contribute until  and beyond we are also making changes to how we position our engineering services business where results have clearly been a disappointment were more heavily utilizing our sri lankan resources and well focus on further streamlining overhead to provide a more attractive cost structure to our customers and what has become a highly competitive marketplace impacted by a slowdown in new development programs weve also made changes to our business development strategy to market our services to a broader array of customers and put additional focus on the aftermarket which is a segment of this business which is grown nicely this year we expect this to continue overall we believe were taking the necessary steps to position the company for improved operating performance and topline performance overtime with the new strategic vision in place we remain committed to building a customer focused worldclass aerospace organization that deliverers unique valueadded products and systems and provide superior longterm shareholder returns one other note well return to providing guidance starting in march for  id now like to have cliff stebe speak with you in more detail about the third quarter financial results reported this morning cliff clifford c stebe thanks dan good morning everyone ill discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter and address how they impacted the financial statements for lmi overall we generated  million in revenue and had a net income of  million for the quarter or  per fully diluted share this compares to  million in revenue and  million of net income or  per fully diluted share in the third quarter of  the third quarter  operating profits included a total of  million of net favorable nonrecurring unusual items driven by a favorable reversal of a loss reserve on a longterm contract as dan mentioned worth  million somewhat offset by  million of accelerated depreciation  million of restructuring expense and  million in environmental expenses the third quarter  operating income excluding the net favorable nonrecurring items discussed above would have been  million or  of sales compared to  million for the third quarter  third quarter of  also included a discrete income tax benefit of  million also on a positive note as dan mentioned this was the fourth quarter in a row in which we generated positive cash flow we generated  million of cash from operations this quarter we utilize this cash as dan mentioned to pay down  million of debt including  million to take the borrowings on our revolving credit agreement to  at quarter end and retired  million of our senior secured notes we expect operating cash flow to be positive through the remainder of  as we continue to work on improving profitability and bringing down our working capital well continue to put pressure on working capital and profitability well into the future now let me turn to the segment results starting with the aerostructures group aerostructures generated  million of revenue in the third quarter down  from  million in the prior year period the decrease was primarily driven by  reduction in sales of military products or we generated  million of revenue in the quarter compared to  million last year difference was entirely driven by the kc program which saw a sales fall  million this quarter due to nonrecurring tooling revenue in the prior period large commercial aircraft remained unchanged during the third quarter of  when compared to the third quarter of  we continue to see yearoveryear growth in the boeing  and  platforms which were  million and  million higher respectively versus  total volume on the boeing  and  were  million and  million respectively however our largest customer did change inventory practices during the quarter which reduced sales by  million in the quarter most notably on the  program we expect an impact on the fourth quarter as well of a similar level the  and  increases were offset by continued decline in sales for the boeing  and  due to lower demand which we saw sales fall  million and  million respectively versus last year aerostructures gross profit was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in the third quarter of  the previously mentioned reversal of loss reserves on a longterm contract contributed  million of that gross profit which was partially offset by  million of accelerated depreciation excluding the impact of these items the gross profit margin would have been  of sales in the third quarter  again compared to  in third quarter but up from  excluding unusuals in the second quarter of  reflecting the impact of cost reductions being implemented aerostructures gross margin was impacted by unfavorable sales mix and lower production levels in the third quarter of  in an effort to reduce working capital selling general and administrative expenses for the aerostructures group was  million compared to  million in the prior year period the difference in sga primarily relates to  million of restructuring cost environmental expense of  million and  million of accelerated depreciation excluding these nonrecurring costs sga costs would have decreased  million in the third quarter versus the prior year period shifting now to engineering services segment the company has continued to experience a decline in demand with total revenue falling to  million in the third quarter of  compared to  million in the prior year period the decline was largely driven by lower design work on tooling for boeing and work for military customers we did see slight growth in the corporate regional jet aircraft revenue which rose to  million from  million last year primarily due to additional revenue this quarter on the bombardier learjet  project sales related to design and delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial aircraft were down  million to  million in the quarter versus  million in the third quarter  this relates to a decline in revenue for a design work on tooling for boeing on the military side sales were up  million to  million in the third quarter  compared to  the decrease primarily reflects the reduction in the boeing tanker program as the design phase is winding down gross profit for the segment was  million or  of net sales for the third quarter of  compared to  million or  of sales for the prior year third quarter the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the decline in sales as fixed costs are spread over lower volumes the quarter of  this quarter for  also was unfavorably impacted by a cumulative catch up adjustment of  million on the mrj program which has experienced higherthanexpected testing costs sga for the engineering services group was  million or  of net sales compared to  million or  of net sales in the prior year period increase was primarily attributable to  million of restructuring and  million of accelerated stock compensation expense related to the departure of a key officer of this segment during the third quarter of  excluding these adjustments sga would have been  million or  million less than the same period in  reflecting costreduction activities interest expense was  million in the quarter of  compared to  million in the third quarter of  the  million increase was entirely related to the higher average interest rates on the highyield notes that were put in place back in june as we have actually reduced our total borrowings outstanding from the prior year we expect to continue be able to reduce debt levels in the fourth quarter the company recognized an income tax benefit for the third quarter of  of  million  million of which relates to an income tax carry back for higherthanexpected tax credits earned next ill talk a bit about cash as i mentioned earlier we generated operating cash flow of  million in third quarter as compared to the use of  million in the third quarter of  this is a result of improved cash collections and reduced program investments to support longterm contracts stretched vendor terms and reduced inventory levels net cash used for investing activities was  million as compared to  million last year ill relook the higher capital spending during the next  quarters as we make investments to support certain programs and replace older equipment since quarter end weve continued to generate positive free cash flow as mentioned previously we utilized the cash flow generated in the quarter to pay down  million of longterm debt which will help reduce interest expense going forward as we  as well as strengthen our balance sheet one last note were in compliance with our debt covenants as the end of third quarter additionally we will be filing our q later today that is the look at the numbers with that howard we are ready for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question or comment comes from the line of tyler hojo from sidoti tyler hojo  sidoti  company inc so just to kind of start on kind of some of the programs you mentioned in the prepared remarks  you said content went up where is it today and then also just on the g and g really nice to see kind of content wins there just wondering if theres some opportunities to kind of scale that up even further as kind of development progresses clifford c stebe tyler its good to talk to you again the  content as we looked into  is around  per ship set weve got a pretty significant portion of work statement that kicks in  as were picking up some work on the  that we had not started in  relative to our ability to grow on the g and g we continue to see opportunities on those aircraft and well continue to look to build on that i would say while i work at this point is been place but we will still continue to see some smaller opportunities overtime daniel g j korte tyler this is dan id also add that on the  program well some of the wins that weve had in the last quarter theyre not just  some of them really in our machining operations but weve also had  wins in our composite facility and weve been trying to grow our composite capabilities weve got a new autoclave installed up there this quarter and it was nice to see  different contracts wins on the  for that facility so i think good progress on the  front tyler hojo  sidoti  company inc thats great can you quantify how much of the  content pickup was actually on the composite side and how many autoclaves do you have now is it  or  daniel g j korte we actually have  autoclaves in operation today but the newest one we just added is a pretty decent size autoclave its an x foot autoclave so we got a lot of capability there the content is relatively small the composite work i think its going to be about between  million and  million a year in content which to the size of the company it may seem small but these are our first major production contracts so to be honest i probably wouldnt want them to be much bigger weve got to make sure that weve got all our processes working smoothly that we get that facility into a production mode and then we look to grow that capability over the next couple of years but its nice to have a good start and be in production tyler hojo  sidoti  company inc okay great great to hear and maybe just a question on the engineered services business can you talk a little bit about i guess what caught you by surprise in terms of the sequential decline in revenue and maybe just kind of in your response you could talk about kind of where headcount is today and just kind of thoughts on how strategic this piece of the business still is daniel g j korte lets see tyler if the design programs come some of the major design programs in the industry come down we see our content come down at the same ratio that the programs are coming down and cliff mentioned the tanker program its not a surprise but that program is moving into the test phase less design work which is where our key capabilities are so weve been riding down that wave and unfortunately over the  as that occurs were seeing start up of a lot of new customers as well also some existing customers have been actually expanded work even though it doesnt look like it overall i mentioned some strength in the aftermarket business there its actually up yearonyear and its been up i think every quarter this year as far as its revenue as a subset of the overall engineering services but its a really hard market to predict there is not much backlog in engineering services you kind of have to  what you win today you start on next week and youve got to constantly out there winning new programs so it is difficult for us to forecast and as we get to a point to the next earnings call were releasing guidance i think were going to  we will make sure that we frame that piece of it appropriately for that matter i think our overall headcount is probably down about  heads overall so not  i mean its still probably less than right around  of the workforce thats the nice thing about this business its relatively easy to right size it and to move up and down weve got little more work to do there though as we mentioned weve got some work to do on overheads i think another bright spot in that area is we see more opportunities in using our sri lankan workforce where we provide blended rates to our customers and are able to hit a little bit lower labor rates which is i think been attractive to a number of our key customers tyler hojo  sidoti  company inc okay and just maybe lastly if you wouldnt mind just commenting on kind of the overall cost restructuring initiatives i guess based on the new cost outs that you talked about youll be up to  million in savings on an annualized basis do you still see more room there or maybe just give us an update on kind of what you see today daniel g j korte yes tyler we do still see more room weve got more activities our list of cost reduction activities that we still have in process is relatively long at this point as you get into the list it gets harder and harder to do them they take more time this one we just announced this morning with the closure of this facility theres literally a few months of work that go into a decision like that and making sure that you can do it right and making sure that you dont impact your customers but we continue to see the i think pretty reasonable opportunities to continue to lower our cost structure i also say that of the  million that we announced prior none of that cost is  we are not allowing that to slip back into our operation weve been very diligent and we are tracking that to ensure that we continue to receive the benefits of that as well as the additional  million we talked about this morning in every financial period clifford c stebe i think for instance tyler i mean freight we deem to be great opportunity for us where were located the interdependency of the  of each one of the plants i mean theres several million dollars of spend there that were certainly taking a hard look at logistics are trying to impact that daniel g j korte i think that just to build on what cliff said the other area that weve made some progress on this quarter but were surely not done yet  done working through yet is working capital overall were looking at our inventory levels were looking at  its literally all the elements of working capital to see where else we can reduce in order to drive more cash out of this business and help delever operator our next question or comment comes from the line of myles walton from deutsche bank myles a walton  deutsche bank ag research division i was wondering if you could start with engineering services kind of where we left off and the color in the press release talks about if the trends dont improve theres a risk on impairment and so  questions one is what is the level that you think should improve toward and are the impairments writing off goodwill and intangibles held on balance sheet and if so is there any implications to covenants clifford c stebe ill take the more accounting side of that question i think the impairments mention theres certainly goodwill on intangibles if we continue to see a trend at this level i think our focus over the next few years is to build this i think were kind of running at around the  million trajectory and i think our goal is to get that back into the high s and  million range over time its going to take a bit of work to do that and were going to have to continue to reposition ourselves in the marketplace to win and certainly what dan mentioned earlier relative to how were changing our sales process there what we can do around cost to make ourselves more competitive because as the demand has declined in the overall market weve seen increased competition particularly from overseas and lowercost countries so were trying to take better advantage of what we have to offer in that space daniel g j korte myles just to add to that i mean we dont see the services side of the business as the strongest opportunity for growth as cliff said we would like to see it more in the  million to  million range out in the future but most of our growth push is on the aerostructures side of the business but theres a real nice synergistic benefit to having the engineering business as a part of lmi so if we can kind of keep it at that  million to  million range i mean sure if we see some great opportunities out there to profitably grow it wed look hard at them and probably jump on them but its not where were putting the bulk of our energies as far as the growth prospects for lmi clifford c stebe and myles you did ask a question relative to impact on covenants and it does not have a impact on covenants myles a walton  deutsche bank ag research division okay and dan when you did your strategic review of the business when you first got in you obviously looked at this business as  and evaluated core and noncore with the team and came to i think a conclusion thats core and had to add value of low invested capital and potential to turn around if it doesnt get back in that  s is it still got all of those characteristics or is it volume dependent that it actually has to rebound to just kind of fill in what you thoughts as daniel g j korte well i guess i would say like any part of our business we cant figure out a way to profitably run it ourselves and then we have to look at alternatives our view right now though is we cant i mean we think that we can grow this business we can make it profitable and we can make it a contributing part of the business but again were looking at the entire portfolio constantly and having discussions amongst the team on how best to run the business so if we decide if some point is unattainable the we got to look at other options but for now thats not the situation weve taken a little bit of a dip here and yes we maybe lick our wounds a little bit for a day but then we jump right back in and we think weve got some ways to build a backup myles a walton  deutsche bank ag research division so one of the positives i heard you say dan was that you turned the   contracts from a loss to profitable position and im curious did you do that internally through cost or you do it through supply chain or you do it through contract renegotiation can you just  and are there other programs contracts like that that are kind of long hold in the tent that youre just in a bad place with respect to the contract that you can try and get out of clifford c stebe i think relative to this contract in particular it was a combination of couple of different things there were some pretty significant engineering changes to the program so were able to go back in and negotiate prices for those changes we did a bunch of work with the supply chain mainly as this has got a ton of external content were able once the bombs settle down on this particular program to be able to negotiate better forward pricing and we continue to put pressure on all of our longterm programs as well as every other piece of the work we do to try to make them more efficient particularly relative to labor so certainly the big change on this was relative to the supplychain costs and secondary relative to the price daniel g j korte myles just to add to that i think one of the things that is really nice about this change and this program i mean in the history of lmi we have never had a loss program before this one and this came into the company through the valent acquisition weve now turned this from a loss contract into a profitable contract so were back to having a portfolio of no unprofitable programs it doesnt mean that every program is as profitable as we would like and we work on that every single day but its nice to have a clean slate clifford c stebe and i think weve got  we barely scratched the surface in this contract we just hit right on the  we are really havent yet started the  yet weve got a lot of time for further improvement on this and were pushing the teams to do exactly that daniel g j korte yes weve got our lean team in there quite regularly right now theyre looking at laying out the production  relaying out the production flow theyre looking at some new ways to move product around the factory more efficiently new ways to build the products so as cliff said were very very early on in the low rate production phase of the program yet as it continues to ramp up so weve got opportunities to rip out more cost and make it even more profitable operator our next question or comment comes from the line of bill hoffmann from rbc capital markets william hoffmann  rbc capital markets llc research division dan i wondered if you could help us a little bit as we look forward with the embraer and mitsubishi ramp up over the next couple of quarters and then you also mentioned getting some additional aftermarket business just wondering if you can help us quantify that and how we should think about that going forward daniel g j korte the mrj and embraer programs although they both had their rollout here in the last couple of months i mean those programs dont really start to ramp up for another year or so so theyre there in the test phase of the program were doing some low rate production just to support the program right now but nothing is happening in the production phase in  but the programs are out there it look like theyre going to be successful weve seen some on the mrj side i think it had some good progress on the order book which is encouraging to me and these are quite frankly our first  major design build programs where we did the designs we kind of owned the intellectual property in the design so its a  and we used our engineering workforce the engineering services workforce to do that work so its a i think theres some  were kind of happy with the progress that were making on them at this point we got to get them through the test phase though and theres always some risk in that phase of the program but we hope to see them up in production in the next year or  your second path of your question i believe did i miss it william hoffmann  rbc capital markets llc research division the aftermarket business you talked about  youve gone from opportunity there but  just wondering for the scale of what we might think about for that daniel g j korte the aftermarket business is part of the  our engineering services business if you go back its really the tass organization that was acquired years ago they do a number of  theyve got a broad range of customers and everybody from the us navy to other aerospace customers that they support southwest airlines et cetera that business it hasnt been a  i wouldnt call it meteoric growth but it has been steady growth in that business and customers like what we do and continue to come back to us i probably  ill probably hold off on the projection on where its going until next quarter when we try to put some guidance out there although out of the  sides of the  if you just take the engineering services business its a bit easier to forecast the aftermarket business than it is the frontend design business because some of that after market business is ongoing kind of recurring longterm relationships with our customers so thatll help us with the volatility of those projections going forward william hoffmann  rbc capital markets llc research division and then cliff just want  you guys did a great job this quarter on working capital management just any thoughts on incremental opportunity there are you getting to a point where youre in better shape going forward clifford c stebe i still think there is opportunity there bill i think there is still somethings we can do i think inventory is probably the biggest opportunity there but certainly were going to  weve got some further opportunity to pressurize payables might even be able to do a little bit on  still on accounts receivable so i think all in all theres certainly some dollars to go get there and were pushing the team very hard again we push the team harder this quarter we know we still have work to do just like the cost reductions dan mentioned theres more to be done daniel g j korte yes though we  i mean probably just an interesting aside but we have weekly costreduction meetings we have weekly working capital meetings with all the key team members to go drive these things down i mean it is a key initiative that were going to drive and continue to drive operator our next question or comment comes from the line of ian gilbertson from invesco ian gilbertson already touched on all my questions operator operator instructions im showing no additional audio questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to mr korte for any closing remarks daniel g j korte thanks howard let me just close by saying that were very excited about the progress weve made in such a short period of time but this is just a starting point for lmi we know we can and must do more much more and were taking the necessary steps as we refine our longterm strategic plan we believe that execution in the key areas i discussed earlier will exceed our customers expectations and position the company to achieve continued growth and success in the years to come my personal thanks to the lmi team as they continue to excel in providing significant value to the important customers we serve and my thanks to lmi shareholders for their enduring patience and interest in the future of our company thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating
