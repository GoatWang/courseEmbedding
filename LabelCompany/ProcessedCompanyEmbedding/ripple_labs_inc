digg reddit stumbleupon pinterest email justice news department of justice office of public affairs for immediate release tuesday may   ripple labs inc resolves criminal investigation ripple labs inc and its whollyowned subsidiary xrp ii llc formerly xrp fund ii llc have agreed to resolve a criminal investigation in exchange for a settlement agreement calling for a series of substantial remedial measures including a migration of a portion of ripple’s virtual currency business to a separate entity the company’s ongoing cooperation in other investigations an extensive remedial framework to ensure future compliance with federal laws and forfeiture and penalties totaling  announced us attorney melinda haag of the northern district of california director jennifer shasky calvery of the us treasury department financial crimes enforcement network fincen and chief richard weber of the internal revenue service irs criminal investigation division  the agreement will resolve allegations that ripple and its subsidiary failed to follow the law while engaging in the exchange of virtual currency and that the entities failed to establish and maintain an appropriate antimoney laundering program ripple labs inc is headquartered in san francisco california and developed and sold virtual currency known as “xrp”  as of  the currency of the ripple network xrp is the secondlargest digital currency by market capitalization  the agreement formalizes the steps ripple and its subsidiary must take to bring its virtual currency operation within the existing regulatory framework for money services businesses  the agreement consists of a settlement agreement an agreed statement of facts and a remedial framework for the company going forward  aside from monetary penalties in the form of forfeiture the remedial framework requires the migration of any component of ripple’s business that is engaged in the exchange of virtual currency into an entity registered with fincen  in addition the agreement calls for continued enhancements to the company’s antimoney laundering aml controls and training program  further the remedial framework calls for external audits through the year  enhancements to the ripple protocol increased transaction monitoring and an extensive review of historical activity “by these agreements we demonstrate again that we will remain vigilant to ensure the security of and prevent the misuse of the financial markets” said us attorney haag  “ripple labs inc and its whollyowned subsidiary both have acknowledged that digital currency providers have an obligation not only to refrain from illegal activity but also to ensure they are not profiting by creating products that allow wouldbe criminals to avoid detection  we hope that this sets an industry standard in the important new space of digital currency” the agreement is the culmination of a criminal investigation conducted by us attorney’s office and the internal revenue service’s criminal investigation division  fincen joined the investigation with a parallel civil enforcement action  in that action ripple labs and xrp ii have agreed to pay a  civil penalty  of which will be designated a forfeiture to settle issues raised in the us attorney’s investigation  “virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that comply with our antimoney laundering laws” said director calvery for fincen  “innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to techsmart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products” “federal laws that regulate the reporting of financial transactions are in place to detect and stop illegal activities including those in the virtual currency arena” said chief weber of the irs criminal investigation division  “unregulated virtual currency opens the door for criminals to anonymously conduct illegal activities online eroding our financial systems and creating a wild west environment where following the law is a choice rather than a requirement”  ripple described itself as an exchanger of virtual currency in a december  filing made in san francisco california federal court in an unrelated case  as an exchanger ripple was required to register with fincen and to comply with applicable federal laws and regulations  yet ripple sold xrp even though it had not registered with fincen effectuating sales of over approximately  million in april  alone  ripple also failed to establish and maintain an appropriate aml program and failed to have policies procedures and internal controls to ensure compliance with the bank secrecy act and antimoney laundering laws  in july  ripple incorporated a subsidiary now known as xrp ii that replaced ripple as the seller of xrp  although xrp ii registered with fincen it failed to have an effective aml program or to file appropriate suspicious activity reports  in late  for example it negotiated a  transaction with an individual who had prior felony convictions for dealing in explosive devices and had been sentenced to prison failing to follow its own internal “know your customer” requirements assistant us attorneys kathryn r haun and arvon j perteet handled the matter on behalf of the us attorney’s office with the assistance of daniel charliersmith and leslie cook  the settlement agreement with ripple labs was the result of a coordinated effort by the us attorney’s office and irs criminal investigation working in tandem with fincen attachments  download settlementagreementpdfcomponents usao

may   washington dc – the financial crimes enforcement network fincen working in coordination with the us attorneys office for the northern district of california usaondca assessed a  civil money penalty today against ripple labs inc and its whollyowned subsidiary xrp ii llc formerly known as xrp fund ii llc ripple labs willfully violated several requirements of the bank secrecy act bsa by acting as a money services business msb and selling its virtual currency known as xrp without registering with fincen and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate antimoney laundering aml program designed to protect its products from use by money launderers or terrorist financiers xrp ii later assumed ripple labs functions of selling virtual currency and acting as an msb however like its parent company xrp ii willfully violated the bsa by failing to implement an effective aml program and by failing to report suspicious activity related to several financial transactions “virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that comply with our antimoney laundering laws”said fincen director jennifer shasky calvery “innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to techsmart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products” fincens assessment is concurrent with the usaondcas announcement of a settlement agreement with ripple labs and xrp ii in that settlement the companies resolved possible criminal charges and forfeited  the  forfeiture in that action will be credited to partially satisfy fincens  civil money penalty a statement of facts and violations describing the underlying activity and details of the bsa violations is incorporated into fincens assessment as well as the usaondcas settlement both actions were accompanied by an agreement by ripple and xrp ii to engage in remedial steps to ensure future compliance with amlcft obligations as well as enhanced remedial measures among these steps are agreements to only transact xrp and “ripple trade” activity through a registered msb to implement and maintain an effective aml program to comply with the funds transfer and funds travel rules to conduct a threeyear “lookback” to require suspicious activity reporting for prior suspicious transactions and a requirement for the companies to retain external independent auditors to review their compliance with the bsa every two years up to and including  pursuant to the agreement ripple labs will also undertake certain enhancements to the ripple protocol to appropriately monitor all future transactions “by these agreements we demonstrate again that we will remain vigilant to ensure the security of and prevent the misuse of the financial markets” said us attorney melinda haag “ripple labs inc and its whollyowned subsidiary both have acknowledged that digital currency providers have an obligation not only to refrain from illegal activity but also to ensure they are not profiting by creating products that allow would–be criminals to avoid detection we hope that this sets an industry standard in the important new space of digital currency” “federal laws that regulate the reporting of financial transactions are in place to detect and stop illegal activities including those in the virtual currency arena” said richard weber chief irs criminal investigation “unregulated virtual currency opens the door for criminals to anonymously conduct illegal activities online eroding our financial systems and creating a wild west environment where following the law is a choice rather than a requirement” ripple labs inc headquartered in san francisco ca facilitated transfers of virtual currency and provided virtual currency exchange transaction services xrp ii llc is a whollyowned subsidiary of ripple labs that was incorporated as xrp fund ii llc in south carolina on july   the company changed its name to xrp ii in july  as of  ripple is the secondlargest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin on march   fincen released guidance clarifying the applicability of regulations implementing the bsa and the requirement for certain participants in the virtual currency arena–namely virtual currency exchangers and administrators–to register as msbs with fincen pursuant to federal law director shasky calvery expressed her appreciation to the us attorneys office for the northern district of california and to the internal revenue servicecriminal investigation division for their contributions to the investigation and strong partnership with

ripplepay was first developed in  by ryan fugger a web developer in vancouver british columbia fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in vancouver and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money fuggers first iteration of this system ripplepaycom debuted in  as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network this led to the conception of a new system by jed mccaleb of edonkey network which was designed and built by arthur britto and david schwartz in may  they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin which relies on blockchain ledgers this new version of the ripple system was therefore designed to eliminate bitcoins reliance on centralized exchanges use less electricity than bitcoin and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin chris larsen who had previously founded the lending services companies eloan and prosper joined the team in august  and together mccaleb and larsen approached ryan fugger with their digital currency idea after discussions with longstanding members of the ripple community fugger handed over the reins in september  the team cofounded the corporation opencoin or opencoin inc opencoin and ripple labs –edit main article ripple company opencoin began developing a new payment protocol called the ripple transaction protocol rtxp based on ryan fuggers concepts the ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties as such the protocol can circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system and any type of currency can be exchanged including usd euros rmb yen gold airline miles and rupees to maintain security opencoin programmed ripple to rely on a common ledger that is managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records servers could belong to anyone including banks or market makers the company also created its own form of digital currency dubbed xrp in a manner similar to bitcoin using the currency to allow financial insititutions to transfer money with negligible fees and waittime among opencoins early investors were andreessen horowitz and google ventures on july   xrp fund ii llc now called simply xrp ii was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of opencoin and headquartered in south carolina the following day ripple announced its linking of the bitcoin and ripple protocols via the bitcoin bridge the bitcoin bridge allows ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a bitcoin address ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as zipzap on september   opencoin inc changed its name to ripple labs inc with chris larsen remaining ceo on the same day the ripple reference server and client became free software released as open source under the terms of the isc license ripple labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind ripple which can integrate with banks’ existing networks in october  ripple partnered further with zipzap with the relationship called a threat to western union in the press focus on banking market –edit by  ripple labs was involved in several development projects related to the protocol releasing for example an ios client app for the iphone that allows iphone users to send and receive any currency via their phone this ripple client app no longer exists in july  ripple labs proposed codius a project to develop a new smart contract system that is programming language agnostic we think that the bigger opportunity is not just to create another digital currency – there are plenty of those  but rather to use that technology as a way of building a settlement system with no central operator — ripple ceo chris larsen in december  since  the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to offer an alternative remittance option to consumers ripple allows for crossborder payments for retail customers corporations and other banks and larsen was quoted stating that ripple simplifies the exchange process by creating pointtopoint and transparent transfers in which banks do not have to pay corresponding bank fees the first bank to use ripple was fidor bank in munich which announced the partnership in early  fidor is an onlineonly bank based in germany that september the new jerseybased cross river bank and kansasbased cbw bank announced they would be using the ripple protocol by december ripple labs began working with global payments service earthport combining ripples software with earthports payment services system earthports clients include banks such as bank of america and hsbc and it operates in  countries the partnership marked the first network usage of the ripple protocol in december  alone the xrp price value rose over  helping ripple surpass litecoin to become the second biggest cryptocurrency and setting ripples market capitalization at close to half a billion in february  fidor bank announced they would be using the ripple protocol to implement a new realtime international money transfer network and in late april  it was announced that western union was planning to experiment with ripple in late may  commonwealth bank of australia announced it would be experimenting with ripple in relation to intrabank transfers since  representatives of ripple labs have professed support for government regulation of the cryptocurrency market claiming that regulations help businesses grow on may   fincen fined ripple labs and xrp ii us for violation of the bank secrecy act based on the financial crimes enforcement networks additions to the act in  ripple labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance which included an agreement to only transact xrp and ripple trade activity through registered money services businesses msb among other agreements such as

oversee the creation and maintenance of ripple payment transaction rules formalized standards for activity using ripple and other actions to support the implementation of ripple payment capabilities conceptedit as an open protocol ripple enables a peertopeer server architecture to facilitate the movement of value among financial institutions this allows financial services companies to make payments directly to each other whether across different networks geographic borders or currencies — consultative group to assist the poor in  ripples website describes the opensource protocol as basic infrastructure technology for interbank transactions – a neutral utility for financial institutions and systems the protocol allows banks and nonbank financial services companies to incorporate the ripple protocol into their own systems and therefore allow their customers to use the service currently ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur first a regulated financial institution holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers second market makers such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in at its core ripple is based around a shared public database or ledger that has its contents decided on by consensus in addition to balances the ledger holds information about offers to buy or sell currencies and assets creating the first distributed exchange the consensus process allows for payments exchanges and remittance in a distributed process according to the cgap in  ripple does for payments what smtp did for email which is enable the systems of different financial institutions to communicate directly in ripple users make payments between each other by using cryptographically signed transactions denominated in either fiat currencies or ripples internal currency xrp for xrpdenominated transactions ripple can make use of its internal ledger while for payments denominated in other assets the ripple ledger only records the amounts owed with assets represented as debt obligations as originally ripple only kept records in its ledger and has no realworld enforcement power trust was requiredclarification needed however ripple is now integrated with various user verification protocols and bank services users have to specify which other users they trust and to what amount when a nonxrp payment is made between two users that trust each other the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted subject to limits set by each user in order to send assets between users that have not directly established a trust relationship the system tries to find a path between the two users such that each link of the path is between two users that do have a trust relationship all balances along the path are then adjusted simultaneously and atomically this mechanism of making payments through a network of trusted associates is named rippling it has similarities to the ageold hawala system design featuresedit gatewaysedit a gateway is any person or organization that enables users to put money into and take money out of ripples liquidity pool a gateway accepts currency deposits from users and issues balances into ripples distributed ledger furthermore gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they hold when currency is withdrawn in practice gateways are similar to banks yet they share one global ledger known as the ripple protocol depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a gateway the gateway may have antimoney laundering aml or know your customer kyc policies requiring verification of identification address nationality etc to prevent criminal activity popular gateways as of  included bitstamp gatehub ripple fox tokyo jpy mr ripple ripplechina and the rock trading trustlines and ripplingedit users must ‘extend trust’ to the ripple gateway that holds their deposit this manual creation of a trustline indicates to the ripple network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s counterparty risk furthermore the user must put a quantitative limit on this trust and create a similar limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway for example if a user deposits us and btc at the rock trading the user will have to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway for the monies to be available in the ripple network when a user has allowed multiple gateways in the same currency there is an advanced option to allow rippling which subjects the user’s balance of that currency to switch or ripple between gateways though their total balance doesnt alter users earn a small transit fee for providing intergateway liquidity creditworthinessedit similar to reasons during the free banking era in the united states the value of a currency can vary significantly depending on a gateways creditworthiness a nonprofit trade association the international ripple business association irba provides unified procedures and disclosure standards for gateways as of june update fifteen businesses had met or exceeded the irba standards consensus ledgeredit ripple relies on a common shared ledger which is a distributed database storing information about all ripple accounts the network is managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records servers could belong to anyone including banks or market makers though the ripple protocol is freeware ripple labs continues to develop and promote the ripple protocol which confirms financial transactions via a network of distributed servers ripple labs is currently assisting banks in integrating with the ripple network a new ledger is created every few seconds and the last closed ledger is a perfect record of all ripple accounts as determined by the network of servers a transaction is any proposed change to the ledger and can be introduced by any server to the network the servers attempt to come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply to the ledger creating a new ‘last closed ledger’ the consensus process is distributed and the goal of consensus is for each server to apply the same set of transactions to the current ledger servers continually receive transactions from other servers on the network and the server determines which transactions to apply based on if a transaction came from a specified node in the ‘unique node list’ or unlnot in citation given transactions that are agreed upon by a supermajority of peers are considered validated if the supermajority isnt in consensus this implies that transaction volume was too high or network latency too great for the consensus process to produce consistent proposals then the consensus process is again attempted by the nodes each round of consensus reduces disagreement until the supermajority is reached the intended outcome of this process is that disputed transactions are discarded from proposals while widely accepted transactions are included while users may assemble their own unl nodes and have full control over which nodes they trust ripple labs acknowledges that most people will use the default unl supplied by their clientnot in citation given ledger securityedit in early  a rival company called the stellar foundation experienced a network crash the company brought in david mazieres stellars chief scientist and head of stanford universitys secure computing group to conduct a review of the stellar consensus system which was similar to ripples mazieres declared the stellar system unlikely to be safe when operating with more than one validating node arguing that when consensus is not reached a ledger fork occurs with parts of the network disagreeing over accepted transactions the stellar foundation afterwards claimed that there was an innate weaknesses in the consensus process a claim which according to finance magnates ripple vehemently denied ripple labs chief cryptographer david schwartz disputed mazieres findings and declared that stellar had incorrectly implemented the consensus system as the protocol provides safety and fault tolerance assuming the validators are configured correctly the company further wrote that after examining stellars information they had concluded that there is no threat to the continued operation of the ripple network use as a paymentforex systemedit ripple allows users or businesses to conduct crosscurrency transactions in  to  seconds all accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and algorithmically verified payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third parties or intermediaries ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification with very little latency within a few seconds payments are irreversible and there are no chargebacks xrp cannot be frozen or seized while as of  anyone could open an account on ripple by  identity verification procedures had been implemented ripples pathfinding algorithm searches for the fastest cheapest path between two currencies in the case of a user who wants to send a payment from usd to eur this could be a onehop path directly from usd to eur or it could be a multihop path perhaps from usd to cad to xrp to eur path finding is designed to seek out the cheapest conversion cost for the user as of may  update ripples gateways allow deposits in a limited number of fiat currencies usd eur mxn nzd gbp nok jpy cad chf cny aud a handful of crypto currencies btc xrp ltc nmc nxt ppc xvn sll and a few commodities gold silver platinum the bitcoin bridgeedit the bitcoin bridge is a link between the ripple and bitcoin ecosystems the bridge makes it possible to pay any bitcoin user straight from a ripple account without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency additionally any merchant accepting bitcoins has the potential to accept any currency in the world for example a ripple user may prefer to keep money in usd and not own bitcoins a merchant however may desire payment in bitcoin the bitcoin bridge allows any ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange such as btce to acquire them bitstamp acts as a gateway for the ripple payment protocol among other exchanges privacyedit while transaction information on the ledger is public payment information is not it’s thus difficult for anyone to associate transaction information with any specific user or corporation market makersedit any user on ripple can act as a market maker by offering an arbitrage service such as providing market liquidity intragateway currency conversion rippling etc market makers can also be hedge funds or currency trading desks according to the ripple website by holding balances in multiple currencies and connecting to multiple gateways market makers facilitate payments between users where no direct trust exists enabling exchanges across gateways with a sufficient number of market makers the path finding algorithm creates a near frictionless market and enables users to seamlessly pay each other via the network in different currencies without assuming any undesired foreign exchange risk many such services are offered through a traditional platform of offers to buy or sell one currency for another currency bids and asks are aggregated into order books to create a decentralized exchange users can transact with market makers to trade or convert currenciescitation needed ripples path finding algorithm leverages this functionality to allow users to send money in one currency and the recipient to receive it in another currency for example a user can pay with usd and the recipient can choose to receive the money in another currency including bitcoins and xrp open apiedit ripple labs built the protocol to be friendly to the developer community and resulting features include an api for its payment network based on the popular rest api standard one of the earliest extensions by thirdparty developers was a ripple extension to ecommerce platform magento which enables magento to read the ripple public ledger and create an invoice there has been a ripple wallet payment option developed for retail situations as well xrpedit xrp iso  code xrpa demographics users ripple  unofficial xrp exists natively within the ripple protocol as a counterpartyfree currency as bitcoin does on the blockchain because xrp is an asset as opposed to a redeemable balance it does not require that users trust any specific financial institution to trade or exchange it all other currencies on ripple do require some amount of trust as they each have an issuer from whom that currency can be redeemed this includes btc on the ripple network — ripple protocol xrp is the native currency of the ripple network that only exists within the ripple system xrp are currently divisible to  decimal places and the smallest unit is called a drop with  million drops equaling  xrp there were  billion xrp created at ripples inception with no more allowed to be created according to the protocols rules as such the system was designed so xrp is a scarce asset with decreasing available supply not dependent on any third party for redemption xrp is the only currency in the ripple network that does not entail counterparty risk and it is the only native digital asset the other currencies in the ripple network are debt instruments ie liabilities and exist in the form of balances users of the ripple network are not required to use xrp as a store of value or a medium of exchange each ripple account is required however to have a small reserve of  xrp us as of may   the purpose for this requirement is discussed in the antispam section distributionedit of the  billion created  billion xrp were retained by the creators who were also the founders of ripple labs the creators gave the remaining  of the total to ripple labs with the xrp intended to incentivize market maker activity to increase xrp liquidity and strengthen the overall health of xrp markets ripple labs also had a shortlived  giveaway of under  million xrp  of all xrp with some of the amount given to charities such as the computing for good initiative which began offering xrp in exchange for time volunteered on research projects as of march   of ripple labss original  was still retained by the company with ripple labs stating that we will engage in distribution strategies that we expect will result in a stable or strengthening xrp exchange rate against other currencies in may  to alleviate concerns surrounding xrp supply ripple committed to place  billion xrp  of its xrp holdings into a cryptographicallysecured escrow the escrow will allow them to sell up to  billion monthly and return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow queue in the form of an additional monthlong contract starting the process all over the amount of xrp distributed and their movement can be tracked through the ripple charts website as a bridge currencyedit one of the specific functions of xrp is as a bridge currency which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs within the network’s currency exchange xrp are traded freely against other currencies and its market price fluctuates against dollars euros yen bitcoin etc ripples design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributedrtgs as opposed to emphasizing xrp as an alternative currency in april  ripple labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to ripple with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs the feature is also intended to expose more of the network to liquidity and better fx rates as an antispam measureedit when a user conducts a financial transaction in a nonnative currency ripple charges a transaction fee the purpose of the fees is to protect against network flooding by making the attacks too expensive for hackers if ripple were completely free to access adversaries could broadcast large amounts of ledger spam ie fake accounts and transaction spam ie fake transactions in an attempt to overload the network this could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions thus to engage in trade each ripple account is required to have a small reserve of  xrp us as of october   and a transaction fee starting at  xrp us as of october   must be spent for each trade this transaction fee is not collected by anyone the xrp is destroyed and ceases to exist the transaction fee rises if the user posts trades at an enormous rate many thousands per minute and resettles after a period of inactivity receptionedit since its debut the ripple protocol has received a fair amount of attention in both the financial and mainstream press ripple has recently been mentioned in industry articles by the nielsen company the bank of england quarterly bulletin nacha and kpmg with many of the articles examining ripples effect on internationalizing the banking industry in april  american banker asserted that from banks perspective distributed ledgers like the ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin including security wrote the federal reserve bank of boston the adoption of distributed networks such as ripple may help the banking industry realize faster processing as well as greater efficiencies for global payments and correspondent banking writing for esquire about ripple as a payment network in  ken kurson said that the big financialservice brands ought to feel about ripple the way the record labels felt about napster the new york times website dealbook points out in  that “ripple is winning something that has proved elusive for virtual currencies involvement from more mainstream players in the financial system” in august  ripple has been awarded as technology pioneer by world economic forum comparisons to competition external video ripple ceo chris larsen interviewed about ripple by deirdre bolton on bloomberg televisions money moves  though ripple is third in market capitalization to bitcoin as a digital currency many members of the press have described ripple as an upandcoming rival to bitcoin in late  bloomberg called bitcoin a failing digital currency after bitcoins currency fell  percent in value in one year ripple was described as a significant competitor in part because of its realtime international money transfers bill gates supported this outlook and mentioned the ripple system when asked about bitcoin in  stating there’s a lot that bitcoin or ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically but bitcoin won’t be the dominant system” about ripples allowance of any electronic value holder the vice president of the st louis federal reserve and professor at simon fraser university david andolfatto stated in  that ripple is a currencyagnostic protocol ripple is the winner it processes anything for its creation and development of the ripple protocol rtxp and the ripple paymentexchange network the massachusetts institute of technology mit recognized ripple labs as one of s  smartest companies in the february  edition of mit technology review reactions to xrp the reaction to xrp is polarized in the cryptocurrency community proponents of bitcoin have criticized xrp for being premined as xrp is built directly into the ripple protocol and requires no mining also ripple labs distribution of the original limited amount of xrp currency has met with a fair amount of controversy and in particular the founders retainment of  is seen as a high percentage however esquire countered in  that if that is devious then so is every company thats ever gone public while retaining the great bulk of its shares much of the controversy was settled after the announcement that the founders jed mccaleb and arthur britto would be selling their xrp at a mediated rate over several years a move that should add stability and restore confidence to the xrp market ceo chris larsen in turn donated  billion xrp to the ripple foundation for financial innovation with the xrp to be locked up and donated over time in  of the

enable secure instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks it supports tokens representing fiat currency cryptocurrency commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes at its core ripple is based around a shared public database or ledger which uses a consensus process that allows for payments exchanges and remittance in a distributed process in  ripple defended the security of its consensus algorithm against rival stellar network currently ripple is the thirdlargest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after

external links historyedit early development –edit the predecessor to the ripple payment protocol ripplepay was first developed in  by ryan fugger a web developer in vancouver british columbia fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in vancouver and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money fuggers first iteration of this system ripplepaycom debuted in  as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network this led to the conception of a new system by jed mccaleb of edonkey network which was designed and built by arthur britto and david schwartz in may  they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin which relies on blockchain ledgers this new version of the ripple system was therefore designed to eliminate bitcoins reliance on centralized exchanges use less electricity than bitcoin and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin chris larsen who had previously founded the lending services companies eloan and prosper joined the team in august  and together mccaleb and larsen approached ryan fugger with their digital currency idea after discussions with longstanding members of the ripple community fugger handed over the reins in september  the team cofounded the corporation opencoin or opencoin inc opencoin and ripple labs –edit main article ripple company opencoin began developing a new payment protocol called the ripple transaction protocol rtxp based on ryan fuggers concepts the ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties as such the protocol can circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system and any type of currency can be exchanged including usd euros rmb yen gold airline miles and rupees to maintain security opencoin programmed ripple to rely on a common ledger that is managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records servers could belong to anyone including banks or market makers the company also created its own form of digital currency dubbed xrp in a manner similar to bitcoin using the currency to allow financial insititutions to transfer money with negligible fees and waittime among opencoins early investors were andreessen horowitz and google ventures on july   xrp fund ii llc now called simply xrp ii was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of opencoin and headquartered in south carolina the following day ripple announced its linking of the bitcoin and ripple protocols via the bitcoin bridge the bitcoin bridge allows ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a bitcoin address ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as zipzap on september   opencoin inc changed its name to ripple labs inc with chris larsen remaining ceo on the same day the ripple reference server and client became free software released as open source under the terms of the isc license ripple labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind ripple which can integrate with banks’ existing networks in october  ripple partnered further with zipzap with the relationship called a threat to western union in the press focus on banking market –edit by  ripple labs was involved in several development projects related to the protocol releasing for example an ios client app for the iphone that allows iphone users to send and receive any currency via their phone this ripple client app no longer exists in july  ripple labs proposed codius a project to develop a new smart contract system that is programming language agnostic we think that the bigger opportunity is not just to create another digital currency – there are plenty of those  but rather to use that technology as a way of building a settlement system with no central operator — ripple ceo chris larsen in december  since  the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to offer an alternative remittance option to consumers ripple allows for crossborder payments for retail customers corporations and other banks and larsen was quoted stating that ripple simplifies the exchange process by creating pointtopoint and transparent transfers in which banks do not have to pay corresponding bank fees the first bank to use ripple was fidor bank in munich which announced the partnership in early  fidor is an onlineonly bank based in germany that september the new jerseybased cross river bank and kansasbased cbw bank announced they would be using the ripple protocol by december ripple labs began working with global payments service earthport combining ripples software with earthports payment services system earthports clients include banks such as bank of america and hsbc and it operates in  countries the partnership marked the first network usage of the ripple protocol in december  alone the xrp price value rose over  helping ripple surpass litecoin to become the second biggest cryptocurrency and setting ripples market capitalization at close to half a billion in february  fidor bank announced they would be using the ripple protocol to implement a new realtime international money transfer network and in late april  it was announced that western union was planning to experiment with ripple in late may  commonwealth bank of australia announced it would be experimenting with ripple in relation to intrabank transfers since  representatives of ripple labs have professed support for government regulation of the cryptocurrency market claiming that regulations help businesses grow on may   fincen fined ripple labs and xrp ii us for violation of the bank secrecy act based on the financial crimes enforcement networks additions to the act in  ripple labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance which included an agreement to only transact xrp and ripple trade activity through registered money services businesses msb among other agreements such as enhancing the ripple protocol the enhancement wont change the protocol itself but will instead add aml transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis as of  the current release of the server known as rippled is version  the year  and  marked the expansion of

banks had joined representing over  of total banking assets in japan on september   ripple announced the creation of the first interbank group for global payments based on distributed financial technology as of april  members of the network known as the global payments steering group gpsg are bank of america merrill lynch canadian imperial bank of commerce mitsubishi ufj financial group royal bank of canada santander standard chartered unicredit and westpac banking corporation the group will oversee the creation and maintenance of ripple payment transaction rules formalized standards for activity using ripple and other actions to support the implementation of ripple payment capabilities conceptedit as an open protocol ripple enables a peertopeer server architecture to facilitate the movement of value among financial institutions this allows financial services companies to make payments directly to each other whether across different networks geographic borders or currencies — consultative group to assist the poor in  ripples website describes the opensource protocol as basic infrastructure technology for interbank transactions – a neutral utility for financial institutions and systems the protocol allows banks and nonbank financial services companies to incorporate the ripple protocol into their own systems and therefore allow their customers to use the service currently ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur first a regulated financial institution holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers second market makers such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in at its core ripple is based around a shared public database or ledger that has its contents decided on by consensus in addition to balances the ledger holds information about offers to buy or sell currencies and assets creating the first distributed exchange the consensus process allows for payments exchanges and remittance in a distributed process according to the cgap in  ripple does for payments what smtp did for email which is enable the systems of different financial institutions to communicate directly in ripple users make payments between each other by using cryptographically signed transactions denominated in either fiat currencies or ripples internal currency xrp for xrpdenominated transactions ripple can make use of its internal ledger while for payments denominated in other assets the ripple ledger only records the amounts owed with assets represented as debt obligations as originally ripple only kept records in its ledger and has no realworld enforcement power trust was requiredclarification needed however ripple is now integrated with various user verification protocols and bank services users have to specify which other users they trust and to what amount when a nonxrp payment is made between two users that trust each other the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted subject to limits set by each user in order to send assets between users that have not directly established a trust relationship the system tries to find a path between the two users such that each link of the path is between two users that do have a trust relationship all balances along the path are then adjusted simultaneously and atomically this mechanism of making payments through a network of trusted associates is named rippling it has similarities to the ageold hawala system design featuresedit gatewaysedit a gateway is any person or organization that enables users to put money into and take money out of ripples liquidity pool a gateway accepts currency deposits from users and issues balances into ripples distributed ledger furthermore gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they hold when currency is withdrawn in practice gateways are similar to banks yet they share one global ledger known as the ripple protocol depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a gateway the gateway may have antimoney laundering aml or know your customer kyc policies requiring verification of identification address nationality etc to prevent criminal activity popular gateways as of  included bitstamp gatehub ripple fox tokyo jpy mr ripple ripplechina and the rock trading trustlines and ripplingedit users must ‘extend trust’ to the ripple gateway that holds their deposit this manual creation of a trustline indicates to the ripple network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s counterparty risk furthermore the user must put a quantitative limit on this trust and create a similar limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway for example if a user deposits us and btc at the rock trading the user will have to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway for the monies to be available in the ripple network when a user has allowed multiple gateways in the same currency there is an advanced option to allow rippling which subjects the user’s balance of that currency to switch or ripple between gateways though their total balance doesnt alter users earn a small transit fee for providing intergateway liquidity creditworthinessedit similar to reasons during the free banking era in the united states the value of a currency can vary significantly depending on a gateways creditworthiness a nonprofit trade association the international ripple business association irba provides unified procedures and disclosure standards for gateways as of june update fifteen businesses had met or exceeded the irba standards consensus ledgeredit ripple relies on a common shared ledger which is a distributed database storing information about all ripple accounts the network is managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records servers could belong to anyone including banks or market makers though the ripple protocol is freeware ripple labs continues to develop and promote the ripple protocol which confirms financial transactions via a network of distributed servers ripple labs is currently assisting banks in integrating with the ripple network a new ledger is created every few seconds and the last closed ledger is a perfect record of all ripple accounts as determined by the network of servers a transaction is any proposed change to the ledger and can be introduced by any server to the network the servers attempt to come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply to the ledger creating a new ‘last closed ledger’ the consensus process is distributed and the goal of consensus is for each server to apply the same set of transactions to the current ledger servers continually receive transactions from other servers on the network and the server determines which transactions to apply based on if a transaction came from a specified node in the ‘unique node list’ or unlnot in citation given transactions that are agreed upon by a supermajority of peers are considered validated if the supermajority isnt in consensus this implies that transaction volume was too high or network latency too great for the consensus process to produce consistent proposals then the consensus process is again attempted by the nodes each round of consensus reduces disagreement until the supermajority is reached the intended outcome of this process is that disputed transactions are discarded from proposals while widely accepted transactions are included while users may assemble their own unl nodes and have full control over which nodes they trust ripple labs acknowledges that most people will use the default unl supplied by their clientnot in citation given ledger securityedit in early  a rival company called the stellar foundation experienced a network crash the company brought in david mazieres stellars chief scientist and head of stanford universitys secure computing group to conduct a review of the stellar consensus system which was similar to ripples mazieres declared the stellar system unlikely to be safe when operating with more than one validating node arguing that when consensus is not reached a ledger fork occurs with parts of the network disagreeing over accepted transactions the stellar foundation afterwards claimed that there was an innate weaknesses in the consensus process a claim which according to finance magnates ripple vehemently denied ripple labs chief cryptographer david schwartz disputed mazieres findings and declared that stellar had incorrectly implemented the consensus system as the protocol provides safety and fault tolerance assuming the validators are configured correctly the company further wrote that after examining stellars information they had concluded that there is no threat to the continued operation of the ripple network use as a paymentforex systemedit ripple allows users or businesses to conduct crosscurrency transactions in  to  seconds all accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and algorithmically verified payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third parties or intermediaries ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification with very little latency within a few seconds payments are irreversible and there are no chargebacks xrp cannot be frozen or seized while as of  anyone could open an account on ripple by  identity verification procedures had been implemented ripples pathfinding algorithm searches for the fastest cheapest path between two currencies in the case of a user who wants to send a payment from usd to eur this could be a onehop path directly from usd to eur or it could be a multihop path perhaps from usd to cad to xrp to eur path finding is designed to seek out the cheapest conversion cost for the user as of may  update ripples gateways allow deposits in a limited number of fiat currencies usd eur mxn nzd gbp nok jpy cad chf cny aud a handful of crypto currencies btc xrp ltc nmc nxt ppc xvn sll and a few commodities gold silver platinum the bitcoin bridgeedit the bitcoin bridge is a link between the ripple and bitcoin ecosystems the bridge makes it possible to pay any bitcoin user straight from a ripple account without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency additionally any merchant accepting bitcoins has the potential to accept any currency in the world for example a ripple user may prefer to keep money in usd and not own bitcoins a merchant however may desire payment in bitcoin the bitcoin bridge allows any ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange such as btce to acquire them bitstamp acts as a gateway for the ripple payment protocol among other exchanges privacyedit while transaction information on the ledger is public payment information is not it’s thus difficult for anyone to associate transaction information with any specific user or corporation market makersedit any user on ripple can act as a market maker by offering an arbitrage service such as providing market liquidity intragateway currency conversion rippling etc market makers can also be hedge funds or currency trading desks according to the ripple website by holding balances in multiple currencies and connecting to multiple gateways market makers facilitate payments between users where no direct trust exists enabling exchanges across gateways with a sufficient number of market makers the path finding algorithm creates a near frictionless market and enables users to seamlessly pay each other via the network in different currencies without assuming any undesired foreign exchange risk many such services are offered through a traditional platform of offers to buy or sell one currency for another currency bids and asks are aggregated into order books to create a decentralized exchange users can transact with market makers to trade or convert currenciescitation needed ripples path finding algorithm leverages this functionality to allow users to send money in one currency and the recipient to receive it in another currency for example a user can pay with usd and the recipient can choose to receive the money in another currency including bitcoins and xrp open apiedit ripple labs built the protocol to be friendly to the developer community and resulting features include an api for its payment network based on the popular rest api standard one of the earliest extensions by thirdparty developers was a ripple extension to ecommerce platform magento which enables magento to read the ripple public ledger and create an invoice there has been a ripple wallet payment option developed for retail situations as well xrpedit xrp iso  code xrpa demographics users ripple  unofficial xrp exists natively within the ripple protocol as a counterpartyfree currency as bitcoin does on the blockchain because xrp is an asset as opposed to a redeemable balance it does not require that users trust any specific financial institution to trade or exchange it all other currencies on ripple do require some amount of trust as they each have an issuer from whom that currency can be redeemed this includes btc on the ripple network — ripple protocol xrp is the native currency of the ripple network that only exists within the ripple system xrp are currently divisible to  decimal places and the smallest unit is called a drop with  million drops equaling  xrp there were  billion xrp created at ripples inception with no more allowed to be created according to the protocols rules as such the system was designed so xrp is a scarce asset with decreasing available supply not dependent on any third party for redemption xrp is the only currency in the ripple network that does not entail counterparty risk and it is the only native digital asset the other currencies in the ripple network are debt instruments ie liabilities and exist in the form of balances users of the ripple network are not required to use xrp as a store of value or a medium of exchange each ripple account is required however to have a small reserve of  xrp us as of may   the purpose for this requirement is discussed in the antispam section distributionedit of the  billion created  billion xrp were retained by the creators who were also the founders of ripple labs the creators gave the remaining  of the total to ripple labs with the xrp intended to incentivize market maker activity to increase xrp liquidity and strengthen the overall health of xrp markets ripple labs also had a shortlived  giveaway of under  million xrp  of all xrp with some of the amount given to charities such as the computing for good initiative which began offering xrp in exchange for time volunteered on research projects as of march   of ripple labss original  was still retained by the company with ripple labs stating that we will engage in distribution strategies that we expect will result in a stable or strengthening xrp exchange rate against other currencies in may  to alleviate concerns surrounding xrp supply ripple committed to place  billion xrp  of its xrp holdings into a cryptographicallysecured escrow the escrow will allow them to sell up to  billion monthly and return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow queue in the form of an additional monthlong contract starting the process all over the amount of xrp distributed and their movement can be tracked through the ripple charts website as a bridge currencyedit one of the specific functions of xrp is as a bridge currency which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs within the network’s currency exchange xrp are traded freely against other currencies and its market price fluctuates against dollars euros yen bitcoin etc ripples design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributedrtgs as opposed to emphasizing xrp as an alternative currency in april  ripple labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to ripple with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs the feature is also intended to expose more of the network to liquidity and better fx rates as an antispam measureedit when a user conducts a financial transaction in a nonnative currency ripple charges a transaction fee the purpose of the fees is to protect against network flooding by making the attacks too expensive for hackers if ripple were completely free to access adversaries could broadcast large amounts of ledger spam ie fake accounts and transaction spam ie fake transactions in an attempt to overload the network this could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions thus to engage in trade each ripple account is required to have a small reserve of  xrp us as of october   and a transaction fee starting at  xrp us as of october   must be spent for each trade this transaction fee is not collected by anyone the xrp is destroyed and ceases to exist the transaction fee rises if the user posts trades at an enormous rate many thousands per minute and resettles after a period of inactivity receptionedit since its debut the ripple protocol has received a fair amount of attention in both the financial and mainstream press ripple has recently been mentioned in industry articles by the nielsen company the bank of england quarterly bulletin nacha and kpmg with many of the articles examining ripples effect on internationalizing the banking industry in april  american banker asserted that from banks perspective distributed ledgers like the ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin including security wrote the federal reserve bank of boston the adoption of distributed networks such as ripple may help the banking industry realize faster processing as well as greater efficiencies for global payments and correspondent banking writing for esquire about ripple as a payment network in  ken kurson said that the big financialservice brands ought to feel about ripple the way the record labels felt about napster the new york times website dealbook points out in  that “ripple is winning something that has proved elusive for virtual currencies involvement from more mainstream players in the financial system” in august  ripple has been awarded as technology pioneer by world economic forum comparisons to competition external video ripple ceo chris larsen interviewed about ripple by deirdre bolton on bloomberg televisions money moves  though ripple is third in market capitalization to bitcoin as a digital currency many members of the press have described ripple as an upandcoming rival to bitcoin in late  bloomberg called bitcoin a failing digital currency after bitcoins currency fell  percent in value in one year ripple was described as a significant competitor in part because of its realtime international money transfers bill gates supported this outlook and mentioned the ripple system when asked about bitcoin in  stating there’s a lot that bitcoin or ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically but bitcoin won’t be the dominant system” about ripples allowance of any electronic value holder the vice president of the st louis federal reserve and professor at simon fraser university david andolfatto stated in  that ripple is a currencyagnostic protocol ripple is the winner it processes anything for its creation and development of the ripple protocol rtxp and the ripple paymentexchange network the massachusetts institute of technology mit recognized ripple labs as one of s  smartest companies in the february  edition of mit technology review reactions to xrp the reaction to xrp is polarized in the cryptocurrency community proponents of bitcoin have criticized xrp for being premined as xrp is built directly into the ripple protocol and requires no mining also ripple labs distribution of the original limited amount of xrp currency has met with a fair amount of controversy and in particular the founders retainment of  is seen as a high percentage however esquire countered in  that if that is devious then so is every company thats ever gone public while retaining the great bulk of its shares much of the controversy was settled after the announcement that the founders jed mccaleb and arthur britto would be selling their xrp at a mediated rate over several years a move that should add stability and restore confidence to the xrp market ceo chris larsen in turn donated  billion xrp to the ripple foundation for financial innovation with the xrp to be locked up and donated over time in  of the  allocated initially to the founders nearly half had been donated to nonprofits and charities see alsoedit internet portal list of online

core ripple is based around a shared public database or ledger which uses a consensus process that allows for payments exchanges and remittance in a distributed process in  ripple defended the security of its consensus algorithm against rival stellar network currently ripple is the thirdlargest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin and ethereum used by companies such as

development –edit the predecessor to the ripple payment protocol ripplepay was first developed in  by ryan fugger a web developer in vancouver british columbia fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in vancouver and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money fuggers first iteration of this system ripplepaycom debuted in  as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network this led to the conception of a new system by jed mccaleb of edonkey network which was designed and built by arthur britto and david schwartz in may  they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin which relies on blockchain ledgers this new version of the ripple system was therefore designed to eliminate bitcoins reliance on centralized exchanges use less electricity than bitcoin and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin chris larsen who had previously founded the lending services companies eloan and prosper joined the team in august  and together mccaleb and larsen approached ryan fugger with their digital currency idea after discussions with longstanding members of the ripple community fugger handed over the reins in september  the team cofounded the corporation opencoin or opencoin inc opencoin and ripple labs –edit main article ripple company opencoin began developing a new payment protocol called the ripple transaction protocol rtxp based on ryan fuggers concepts the ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties as such the protocol can circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system and any type of currency can be exchanged including usd euros rmb yen gold airline miles and rupees to maintain security opencoin programmed ripple to rely on a common ledger that is managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records servers could belong to anyone including banks or market makers the company also created its own form of digital currency dubbed xrp in a manner similar to bitcoin using the currency to allow financial insititutions to transfer money with negligible fees and waittime among opencoins early investors were andreessen horowitz and google ventures on july   xrp fund ii llc now called simply xrp ii was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of opencoin and headquartered in south carolina the following day ripple announced its linking of the bitcoin and ripple protocols via the bitcoin bridge the bitcoin bridge allows ripple users to send a payment in any currency to a bitcoin address ripple also developed early partnerships with companies such as zipzap on september   opencoin inc changed its name to ripple labs inc with chris larsen remaining ceo on the same day the ripple reference server and client became free software released as open source under the terms of the isc license ripple labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind ripple which can integrate with banks’ existing networks in october  ripple partnered further with zipzap with the relationship called a threat to western union in the press focus on banking market –edit by  ripple labs was involved in several development projects related to the protocol releasing for example an ios client app for the iphone that allows iphone users to send and receive any currency via their phone this ripple client app no longer exists in july  ripple labs proposed codius a project to develop a new smart contract system that is programming language agnostic we think that the bigger opportunity is not just to create another digital currency – there are plenty of those  but rather to use that technology as a way of building a settlement system with no central operator — ripple ceo chris larsen in december  since  the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to offer an alternative remittance option to consumers ripple allows for crossborder payments for retail customers corporations and other banks and larsen was quoted stating that ripple simplifies the exchange process by creating pointtopoint and transparent transfers in which banks do not have to pay corresponding bank fees the first bank to use ripple was fidor bank in munich which announced the partnership in early  fidor is an onlineonly bank based in germany that september the new jerseybased cross river bank and kansasbased cbw bank announced they would be using the ripple protocol by december ripple labs began working with global payments service earthport combining ripples software with earthports payment services system earthports clients include banks such as bank of america and hsbc and it operates in  countries the partnership marked the first network usage of the ripple protocol in december  alone the xrp price value rose over  helping ripple surpass litecoin to become the second biggest cryptocurrency and setting ripples market capitalization at close to half a billion in february  fidor bank announced they would be using the ripple protocol to implement a new realtime international money transfer network and in late april  it was announced that western union was planning to experiment with ripple in late may  commonwealth bank of australia announced it would be experimenting with ripple in relation to intrabank transfers since  representatives of ripple labs have professed support for government regulation of the cryptocurrency market claiming that regulations help businesses grow on may   fincen fined ripple labs and xrp ii us for violation of the bank secrecy act based on the financial crimes enforcement networks additions to the act in  ripple labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance which included an agreement to only transact xrp and ripple trade activity through registered money services businesses msb among other agreements such as enhancing the ripple protocol the enhancement wont change the protocol itself but will instead add aml transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis as of  the current release of the server known as rippled is version  the year  and  marked the expansion of ripple company with the opening of an office

the new york state department of financial services making it the fourth company with a bitlicense on august   sbi ripple asia announced the creation of a japanese consortium of banks in a new network that will use ripple’s technology for payments and settlement the consortium was officially launched on october   with  member banks as of july   japanese banks had joined representing over  of total banking assets in japan on september   ripple announced the creation of the first interbank group for global payments based on distributed financial technology as of april  members of the network known as the global payments steering group gpsg are bank of america merrill lynch canadian imperial bank of commerce mitsubishi ufj financial group royal bank of canada santander standard chartered unicredit and westpac banking corporation the group will oversee the creation and maintenance of ripple payment transaction rules formalized standards for activity using ripple and other actions to support the implementation of ripple payment capabilities conceptedit as an open protocol ripple enables a peertopeer server architecture to facilitate the movement of value among financial institutions this allows financial services companies to make payments directly to each other whether across different networks geographic borders or currencies — consultative group to assist the poor in  ripples website describes the opensource protocol as basic infrastructure technology for interbank transactions – a neutral utility for financial institutions and systems the protocol allows banks and nonbank financial services companies to incorporate the ripple protocol into their own systems and therefore allow their customers to use the service currently ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur first a regulated financial institution holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers second market makers such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in at its core ripple is based around a shared public database or ledger that has its contents decided on by consensus in addition to balances the ledger holds information about offers to buy or sell currencies and assets creating the first distributed exchange the consensus process allows for payments exchanges and remittance in a distributed process according to the cgap in  ripple does for payments what smtp did for email which is enable the systems of different financial institutions to communicate directly in ripple users make payments between each other by using cryptographically signed transactions denominated in either fiat currencies or ripples internal currency xrp for xrpdenominated transactions ripple can make use of its internal ledger while for payments denominated in other assets the ripple ledger only records the amounts owed with assets represented as debt obligations as originally ripple only kept records in its ledger and has no realworld enforcement power trust was requiredclarification needed however ripple is now integrated with various user verification protocols and bank services users have to specify which other users they trust and to what amount when a nonxrp payment is made between two users that trust each other the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted subject to limits set by each user in order to send assets between users that have not directly established a trust relationship the system tries to find a path between the two users such that each link of the path is between two users that do have a trust relationship all balances along the path are then adjusted simultaneously and atomically this mechanism of making payments through a network of trusted associates is named rippling it has similarities to the ageold hawala system design featuresedit gatewaysedit a gateway is any person or organization that enables users to put money into and take money out of ripples liquidity pool a gateway accepts currency deposits from users and issues balances into ripples distributed ledger furthermore gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they hold when currency is withdrawn in practice gateways are similar to banks yet they share one global ledger known as the ripple protocol depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a gateway the gateway may have antimoney laundering aml or know your customer kyc policies requiring verification of identification address nationality etc to prevent criminal activity popular gateways as of  included bitstamp gatehub ripple fox tokyo jpy mr ripple ripplechina and the rock trading trustlines and ripplingedit users must ‘extend trust’ to the ripple gateway that holds their deposit this manual creation of a trustline indicates to the ripple network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s counterparty risk furthermore the user must put a quantitative limit on this trust and create a similar limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway for example if a user deposits us and btc at the rock trading the user will have to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway for the monies to be available in the ripple network when a user has allowed multiple gateways in the same currency there is an advanced option to allow rippling which subjects the user’s balance of that currency to switch or ripple between gateways though their total balance doesnt alter users earn a small transit fee for providing intergateway liquidity creditworthinessedit similar to reasons during the free banking era in the united states the value of a currency can vary significantly depending on a gateways creditworthiness a nonprofit trade association the international ripple business association irba provides unified procedures and disclosure standards for gateways as of june update fifteen businesses had met or exceeded the irba standards consensus ledgeredit ripple relies on a common shared ledger which is a distributed database storing information about all ripple accounts the network is managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records servers could belong to anyone including banks or market makers though the ripple protocol is freeware ripple labs continues to develop and promote the ripple protocol which confirms financial transactions via a network of distributed servers ripple labs is currently assisting banks in integrating with the ripple network a new ledger is created every few seconds and the last closed ledger is a perfect record of all ripple accounts as determined by the network of servers a transaction is any proposed change to the ledger and can be introduced by any server to the network the servers attempt to come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply to the ledger creating a new ‘last closed ledger’ the consensus process is distributed and the goal of consensus is for each server to apply the same set of transactions to the current ledger servers continually receive transactions from other servers on the network and the server determines which transactions to apply based on if a transaction came from a specified node in the ‘unique node list’ or unlnot in citation given transactions that are agreed upon by a supermajority of peers are considered validated if the supermajority isnt in consensus this implies that transaction volume was too high or network latency too great for the consensus process to produce consistent proposals then the consensus process is again attempted by the nodes each round of consensus reduces disagreement until the supermajority is reached the intended outcome of this process is that disputed transactions are discarded from proposals while widely accepted transactions are included while users may assemble their own unl nodes and have full control over which nodes they trust ripple labs acknowledges that most people will use the default unl supplied by their clientnot in citation given ledger securityedit in early  a rival company called the stellar foundation experienced a network crash the company brought in david mazieres stellars chief scientist and head of stanford universitys secure computing group to conduct a review of the stellar consensus system which was similar to ripples mazieres declared the stellar system unlikely to be safe when operating with more than one validating node arguing that when consensus is not reached a ledger fork occurs with parts of the network disagreeing over accepted transactions the stellar foundation afterwards claimed that there was an innate weaknesses in the consensus process a claim which according to finance magnates ripple vehemently denied ripple labs chief cryptographer david schwartz disputed mazieres findings and declared that stellar had incorrectly implemented the consensus system as the protocol provides safety and fault tolerance assuming the validators are configured correctly the company further wrote that after examining stellars information they had concluded that there is no threat to the continued operation of the ripple network use as a paymentforex systemedit ripple allows users or businesses to conduct crosscurrency transactions in  to  seconds all accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and algorithmically verified payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third parties or intermediaries ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification with very little latency within a few seconds payments are irreversible and there are no chargebacks xrp cannot be frozen or seized while as of  anyone could open an account on ripple by  identity verification procedures had been implemented ripples pathfinding algorithm searches for the fastest cheapest path between two currencies in the case of a user who wants to send a payment from usd to eur this could be a onehop path directly from usd to eur or it could be a multihop path perhaps from usd to cad to xrp to eur path finding is designed to seek out the cheapest conversion cost for the user as of may  update ripples gateways allow deposits in a limited number of fiat currencies usd eur mxn nzd gbp nok jpy cad chf cny aud a handful of crypto currencies btc xrp ltc nmc nxt ppc xvn sll and a few commodities gold silver platinum the bitcoin bridgeedit the bitcoin bridge is a link between the ripple and bitcoin ecosystems the bridge makes it possible to pay any bitcoin user straight from a ripple account without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency additionally any merchant accepting bitcoins has the potential to accept any currency in the world for example a ripple user may prefer to keep money in usd and not own bitcoins a merchant however may desire payment in bitcoin the bitcoin bridge allows any ripple user to send bitcoins without having to use a central exchange such as btce to acquire them bitstamp acts as a gateway for the ripple payment protocol among other exchanges privacyedit while transaction information on the ledger is public payment information is not it’s thus difficult for anyone to associate transaction information with any specific user or corporation market makersedit any user on ripple can act as a market maker by offering an arbitrage service such as providing market liquidity intragateway currency conversion rippling etc market makers can also be hedge funds or currency trading desks according to the ripple website by holding balances in multiple currencies and connecting to multiple gateways market makers facilitate payments between users where no direct trust exists enabling exchanges across gateways with a sufficient number of market makers the path finding algorithm creates a near frictionless market and enables users to seamlessly pay each other via the network in different currencies without assuming any undesired foreign exchange risk many such services are offered through a traditional platform of offers to buy or sell one currency for another currency bids and asks are aggregated into order books to create a decentralized exchange users can transact with market makers to trade or convert currenciescitation needed ripples path finding algorithm leverages this functionality to allow users to send money in one currency and the recipient to receive it in another currency for example a user can pay with usd and the recipient can choose to receive the money in another currency including bitcoins and xrp open apiedit ripple labs built the protocol to be friendly to the developer community and resulting features include an api for its payment network based on the popular rest api standard one of the earliest extensions by thirdparty developers was a ripple extension to ecommerce platform magento which enables magento to read the ripple public ledger and create an invoice there has been a ripple wallet payment option developed for retail situations as well xrpedit xrp iso  code xrpa demographics users ripple  unofficial xrp exists natively within the ripple protocol as a counterpartyfree currency as bitcoin does on the blockchain because xrp is an asset as opposed to a redeemable balance it does not require that users trust any specific financial institution to trade or exchange it all other currencies on ripple do require some amount of trust as they each have an issuer from whom that currency can be redeemed this includes btc on the ripple network — ripple protocol xrp is the native currency of the ripple network that only exists within the ripple system xrp are currently divisible to  decimal places and the smallest unit is called a drop with  million drops equaling  xrp there were  billion xrp created at ripples inception with no more allowed to be created according to the protocols rules as such the system was designed so xrp is a scarce asset with decreasing available supply not dependent on any third party for redemption xrp is the only currency in the ripple network that does not entail counterparty risk and it is the only native digital asset the other currencies in the ripple network are debt instruments ie liabilities and exist in the form of balances users of the ripple network are not required to use xrp as a store of value or a medium of exchange each ripple account is required however to have a small reserve of  xrp us as of may   the purpose for this requirement is discussed in the antispam section distributionedit of the  billion created  billion xrp were retained by the creators who were also the founders of ripple labs the creators gave the remaining  of the total to ripple labs with the xrp intended to incentivize market maker activity to increase xrp liquidity and strengthen the overall health of xrp markets ripple labs also had a shortlived  giveaway of under  million xrp  of all xrp with some of the amount given to charities such as the computing for good initiative which began offering xrp in exchange for time volunteered on research projects as of march   of ripple labss original  was still retained by the company with ripple labs stating that we will engage in distribution strategies that we expect will result in a stable or strengthening xrp exchange rate against other currencies in may  to alleviate concerns surrounding xrp supply ripple committed to place  billion xrp  of its xrp holdings into a cryptographicallysecured escrow the escrow will allow them to sell up to  billion monthly and return whatever is unused at the end of each month to the back of the escrow queue in the form of an additional monthlong contract starting the process all over the amount of xrp distributed and their movement can be tracked through the ripple charts website as a bridge currencyedit one of the specific functions of xrp is as a bridge currency which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs within the network’s currency exchange xrp are traded freely against other currencies and its market price fluctuates against dollars euros yen bitcoin etc ripples design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributedrtgs as opposed to emphasizing xrp as an alternative currency in april  ripple labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to ripple with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs the feature is also intended to expose more of the network to liquidity and better fx rates as an antispam measureedit when a user conducts a financial transaction in a nonnative currency ripple charges a transaction fee the purpose of the fees is to protect against network flooding by making the attacks too expensive for hackers if ripple were completely free to access adversaries could broadcast large amounts of ledger spam ie fake accounts and transaction spam ie fake transactions in an attempt to overload the network this could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the network’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions thus to engage in trade each ripple account is required to have a small reserve of  xrp us as of october   and a transaction fee starting at  xrp us as of october   must be spent for each trade this transaction fee is not collected by anyone the xrp is destroyed and ceases to exist the transaction fee rises if the user posts trades at an enormous rate many thousands per minute and resettles after a period of inactivity receptionedit since its debut the ripple protocol has received a fair amount of attention in both the financial and mainstream press ripple has recently been mentioned in industry articles by the nielsen company the bank of england quarterly bulletin nacha and kpmg with many of the articles examining ripples effect on internationalizing the banking industry in april  american banker asserted that from banks perspective distributed ledgers like the ripple system have a number of advantages over cryptocurrencies like bitcoin including security wrote the federal reserve bank of boston the adoption of distributed networks such as ripple may help the banking industry realize faster processing as well as greater efficiencies for global payments and correspondent banking writing for esquire about ripple as a payment network in  ken kurson said that the big financialservice brands ought to feel about ripple the way the record labels felt about napster the new york times website dealbook points out in  that “ripple is winning something that has proved elusive for virtual currencies involvement from more mainstream players in the financial system” in august  ripple has been awarded as technology pioneer by world economic forum comparisons to competition external video ripple ceo chris larsen interviewed about ripple by deirdre bolton on bloomberg televisions money moves  though ripple is third in market capitalization to bitcoin as a digital currency many members of the press have described ripple as an upandcoming rival to bitcoin in late  bloomberg called bitcoin a failing digital currency after bitcoins currency fell  percent in value in one year ripple was described as a significant competitor in part because of its realtime international money transfers bill gates supported this outlook and mentioned the ripple system when asked about bitcoin in  stating there’s a lot that bitcoin or ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically but bitcoin won’t be the dominant system” about ripples allowance of any electronic value holder the vice president of the st louis federal reserve and professor at simon fraser university david andolfatto stated in  that ripple is a currencyagnostic protocol ripple is the winner it processes anything for its creation and development of the ripple protocol rtxp and the ripple paymentexchange network the massachusetts institute of technology mit recognized ripple labs as one of s  smartest companies in the february  edition of mit technology review reactions to xrp the reaction to xrp is polarized in the cryptocurrency community proponents of bitcoin have criticized xrp for being premined as xrp is built directly into the ripple protocol and requires no mining also ripple labs distribution of the original limited amount of xrp currency has met with a fair amount of controversy and in particular the founders retainment of  is seen as a high percentage however esquire countered in  that if that is devious then so is every company thats ever gone public while retaining the great bulk of its shares much of the controversy was settled after the announcement that the founders jed mccaleb and arthur britto would be selling their xrp at a mediated rate over several years a move that should add stability and restore confidence to the xrp market ceo chris larsen in turn donated  billion xrp to the ripple foundation for financial innovation with the xrp to be locked up and donated over time in  of the  allocated initially to the founders nearly half had been donated to nonprofits and charities see alsoedit internet portal list of online

tuesday may   ripple labs inc resolves criminal investigation san francisco – ripple labs inc and its whollyowned subsidiary xrp ii llc formerly xrp fund ii llc have agreed to resolve a criminal investigation in exchange for a settlement agreement calling for a series of substantial remedial measures including a migration of a portion of ripple’s virtual currency business to a separate entity the company’s ongoing cooperation in other investigations an extensive remedial framework to ensure future compliance with federal laws and forfeiture and penalties totaling  announced united states attorney melinda haag us treasury department financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” director jennifer shasky calvery and internal revenue service criminal investigation division chief richard weber  the agreement will resolve allegations that ripple and its subsidiary failed to follow the law while engaging in the exchange of virtual currency and that the entities failed to establish and maintain an appropriate antimoney laundering program ripple labs inc is headquartered in san francisco and developed and sold virtual currency known as “xrp”  as of  the currency of the ripple network xrp is the secondlargest digital currency by market capitalization the agreement formalizes the steps ripple and its subsidiary must take to bring its virtual currency operation within the existing regulatory framework for money services businesses  the agreement consists of a settlement agreement an agreed statement of facts and a remedial framework for the company going forward  aside from monetary penalties in the form of forfeiture the remedial framework requires the migration of any component of ripple’s business that is engaged in the exchange of virtual currency into an entity registered with fincen  in addition the agreement calls for continued enhancements to the company’s antimoney laundering aml controls and training program  further the remedial framework calls for external audits through the year  enhancements to the ripple protocol increased transaction monitoring and an extensive review of historical activity “by these agreements we demonstrate again that we will remain vigilant to ensure the security of and prevent the misuse of the financial markets” said us attorney melinda haag  “ripple labs inc and its whollyowned subsidiary both have acknowledged that digital currency providers have an obligation not only to refrain from illegal activity but also to ensure they are not profiting by creating products that allow wouldbe criminals to avoid detection  we hope that this sets an industry standard in the important new space of digital currency” the agreement is the culmination of a criminal investigation conducted by us attorney’s office and the internal revenue service’s criminal investigation division  fincen joined the investigation with a parallel civil enforcement action  in that action ripple labs and xrp ii have agreed to pay a  civil penalty  of which will be designated a forfeiture to settle issues raised in the us attorney’s investigation  “virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that comply with our antimoney laundering laws said fincen director jennifer shasky calvery  innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to techsmart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products” “federal laws that regulate the reporting of financial transactions are in place to detect and stop illegal activities including those in the virtual currency arena” said richard weber chief irs criminal investigation “unregulated virtual currency opens the door for criminals to anonymously conduct illegal activities online eroding our financial systems and creating a wild west environment where following the law is a choice rather than a requirement” ripple described itself as an exchanger of virtual currency in a december  filing made in san francisco federal court in an unrelated case  as an exchanger ripple was required to register with fincen and to comply with applicable federal laws and regulations  yet ripple sold xrp even though it had not registered with fincen effectuating sales of over approximately  million us dollars in april  alone  ripple also failed to establish and maintain an appropriate aml program and failed to have policies procedures and internal controls to ensure compliance with the bank secrecy act and antimoney laundering laws  in july  ripple incorporated a subsidiary now known as xrp ii that replaced ripple as the seller of xrp  although xrp ii registered with fincen it failed to have an effective aml program or to file appropriate suspicious activity reports   in late  for example it negotiated a  transaction with an individual who had prior felony convictions for dealing in explosive devices and had been sentenced to prison failing to follow its own internal “know your customer” requirements assistant us attorneys kathryn r haun and arvon j perteet handled the matter on behalf of the us attorney’s office with the assistance of daniel charliersmith and leslie cook  the settlement agreement with ripple labs was the result of a coordinated effort by the united states attorney’s office and irs criminal investigation working in tandem with fincen attachments
