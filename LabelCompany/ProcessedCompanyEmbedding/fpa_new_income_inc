fpa management since july  fund data as of net asset value ticker fpnixcusip  fpa new income inc objective the primary investment objective of fpa new income inc fpnix is current income and longterm total return capital preservation is also a consideration fpa new income inc seeks to generate a positive absolute return through a combination of income and capital appreciation to achieve this goal we employ a total return strategy using  investments in fixed income securities that focus on income appreciation and capital preservation market opportunity will dictate emphasis across these three areas   philosophy we do not like to lose money in order to do this we adhere to the following principles absolute value investors we seek genuine bargains rather than relatively attractive securities absolute return we are absolute return investors and each investment must meet our strict fundamental research and macroeconomic criteria not just offer opportunity relative to other alternatives longterm focus our investment time horizon is usually three to five years we expect to hold our investments to maturity unless fundamental valuation parameters change we are not speculators and adhere to a strict investment discipline alignment of interest we invest alongside you as partners in our process as managers we have significant amounts of our own capital invested in this strategy strict riskreward parameters we like to invest when there is a target rich environment risk of loss is a critical element in our thinking and thus each investment must compensate for its unique risks combined with a margin of safety independent decision making we do not follow the crowd as we are independent in our decision making we are often viewed as contrarian in our strategy and execution flexible mandate we do not bind ourselves to any one benchmark or index we believe this flexibility provides a competitive advantage over those who do not have this capability this has been a critical element in achieving our goal for additional information please reference the absolute fixed income policy statement monthly quarterly historical after tax as of june   comparative performance monthly
