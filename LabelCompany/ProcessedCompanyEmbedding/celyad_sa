approximately  € million based on the public offering price of  € per ads in the us offering and € per ordinary share in the european private placement after deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares and adss if the underwriters exercise in full their options to purchase additional ordinary shares and adss in the global offering we estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of approximately  € million based on the public offering price of  € per ads in the us offering and € per ordinary share in the european private placement after deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purposes of the global offering are to increase our financial flexibility create a public market for our securities in the united states and facilitate our access to the public equity markets we currently expect to use the net proceeds from the global offering as follows  approximately  million to advance the development of ccure through phase  clinical development as a treatment for ischemic hf  approximately  million to advance the development of carnkgd through phase  clinical development as a treatment for aml and mm  approximately  million to advance additional car tcell therapy drug product candidates for the treatment of additional blood cancers and solid tumors and  approximately  million to support our growth globally by expanding general administrative and operational functions in our headquarters in belgium and in the united states we expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the global offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to inlicense acquire or invest in complementary technologies products or assets however we have no current plan commitments or obligations to do so based on our current operation plans and assumptions we believe that such proceeds together with our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operations until at least the end of  however changing circumstances may cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently anticipate and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control we may require additional capital for the further development and commercialization of our drug product candidates and may need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all we have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our drug product candidates or other research and development initiatives our licenses may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment obligations under the agreements we could be required to seek collaborators for our drug product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our drug product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves any these events could significantly harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our adss and our ordinary shares to decline we currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from the global offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above and therefore management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds of the global offering among these uses this expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development efforts the status of and results from preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our drug product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from the global offering pending our use of the net proceeds from the global offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing instruments the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change we face competition from pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and medical devices companies as well as from academic and research institutions some of these competitors are pursuing the development of medicinal products and other therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting some of our current or potential competitors either alone or with their collaboration partners have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy safety and convenience ccure we have identified several companies that are active in cardiac cell therapy as of the date of this prospectus including aldagen inc athersys inc cytori therapeutics inc mesoblast ltd and vericel corporation car tcell therapy early results from clinical trials have fueled continued interest in car tcell therapies and our competitors include bellicum pharmaceuticals inc bluebird bio inc cellectis sa juno therapeutics inc kite pharma inc novartis ag and ziopharm oncology inc company description we are a leader in engineered cell therapy treatments with clinical programs initially targeting indications in cardiovascular disease and oncology our lead drug product candidate in cardiovascular disease is ccure an autologous cell therapy for the treatment of patients with ischemic heart failure or hf we completed enrollment in our first phase  clinical trial of ccure in europe and israel or chart in march  on march   we announced that the data safety monitoring board or dsmb reviewed unblinded safety and efficacy data from chart and determined that such unblinded safety and efficacy data did not support the discontinuation of the trial on the basis of safety or futility these observations suggested that the trial should be continued in its current form the full data readout from this trial is expected in the middle of  we anticipate initiating our second phase  clinical trial of ccure in the united states and europe or chart pending us food and drug administration or fda lifting of the existing clinical hold which we expect in the second half of  our lead drug product candidate in oncology is carnkgd an autologous chimeric antigen receptor or car an artificial lab engineered receptor which is used to graft a given protein onto an immune cell t lymphocyte or car tcell therapy we are currently enrolling patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or aml or multiple myeloma or mm in a phase  clinical trial of carnkgd in the united states the first patient was treated in this trial in april  and no treatmentrelated safety concerns were reported during the day followup period interim data from this trial is expected to be reported at various times during the trial with the full data readout expected in the middle of  all of our current drug product candidates are autologous cell therapy treatments in autologous procedures a patient’s cells are harvested selected reprogrammed and expanded and then infused back into the same patient a benefit of autologous therapies is that autologous cells are not recognized as foreign by patients’ immune systems we believe that we are well situated to effectively advance autologous cell therapy treatments for cancer and other indications as a result of the expertise and knowhow that we have acquired through our development of ccure ccure for ischemic heart failure cardiovascular diseases which are diseases of the heart and blood vessels are the largest cause of mortality in the world and in  approximately  of all global deaths were attributable to cardiovascular diseases according to the world health organization if left untreated cardiac diseases can lead to hf a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s metabolic needs hf affects  to  of the adult population in developed countries and approximately  million patients were diagnosed with hf in the united states in  according to the american heart association hf can either be of ischemic origin linked to impairment of blood flow to the heart muscle or nonischemic origin linked to other causes such as hypertension and metabolic disorders in the bromley heart failure study  of the patients had hf of ischemic origin other studies have reported lower rates of ischemic hf but such differences can be explained by differences in study population definitions and timing of when the study was completed the longterm prognosis associated with hf is dire with approximately  mortality at five years following initial diagnosis according to a  report from the american heart association hf is classified according to the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient the classification most commonly used in the new york heart association or nyha classification where patients are classified from class i where there is no limitation on a patient’s physical activity to class iv where the patient is unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort although existing therapies have been somewhat effective in the treatment of hf there is still great unmet medical need in particular in the case of ischemic hf which is caused by insufficient oxygen to the heart current treatments fail to address the decrease in the number of functional myocytes or heart cells in the heart that result from this lack of oxygen our lead drug product candidate ccure is an autologous cell therapy that we believe has the potential to treat patients with nyha classes ii iii and iv ischemic hf to guide cardiac tissue formation our ccure therapy reprograms multipotent stem cells harvested from a patient into cardiopoietic cells cells that can become myocytes using naturally occurring cytokines small proteins that play an important role in cell signaling and growth factors that mimic the signaling that occurs in embryonic heart tissue development based on preclinical studies we have identified both direct and indirect modes of action for ccure the direct mode may replace nonfunctioning myocytes in the indirect modes factors secreted by the cardiopoietic cells may cause patients’ resident stem cells to begin pooling regenerating and differentiating into cardiac cells with the resulting favorable environment inducing the nonfunctioning myocytes to regain function we have developed ccure predominantly based on technology that we licensed from the mayo foundation for medical education and research or the mayo clinic to assist in the reinjection of cardiopoietic cells we have also developed ccathez which we believe will achieve a higher retention rate of cells in the heart relative to the commercial catheter we used in our prior clinical trial in the ccure process stem cells are collected from an ischemic hf patient through bone marrow aspiration during an outpatient procedure the stem cells are then harvested selected expanded and differentiated into cardiopoietic cells at our manufacturing facility yielding a homogeneous and pure cardiopoietic cell population the cardiopoietic cells are then reinjected into the heart of the ischemic hf patient with our ccathez cell injection catheter phase  clinical trial the first human clinical phase  trial for ccure was completed in  a total of  ischemic hf patients were enrolled in this trial with the primary endpoint being the safety and feasibility of ccure positive outcomes were observed in this trial patients treated with ccure showed a  relative improvement of median left ventricular ejection fraction or lvef which is the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart at each beat at six months versus baseline whereas untreated patients showed a relative improvement of  versus baseline patients treated with ccure also demonstrated an improved exercise capacity as measured by the six minutes walking distance test or six minutes wdt which measures the distance a patient can walk in a six minute period the ccure treatment group’s walking distance improved by  meters compared to the control group phase  clinical program we are pursuing clinical development of ccure through a comprehensive phase  program comprised of two phase  clinical trials chart and chart chart chart is being conducted in the europe and israel and was first authorized in november  chart is a  patient prospective controlled randomized doubleblinded trial including nyha class iii and iv ischemic hf patients with each patient having a  chance of being assigned to the ccure treatment group or the control group the primary endpoint of this trial is an improvement in the composite hierarchical endpoint comprised of mortality morbidity quality of life six minutes wdt left ventricular end systolic volume and lvef each patient in the ccure treatment group will be compared to each patient in the control group and a comprehensive score will be derived to compare one group against the other as of the date of this prospectus we have completed enrollment of all patients in this trial at over  trial sites in europe and israel on march   we announced that dsmb reviewed unblinded safety and efficacy data from chart and determined that such unblinded safety and efficacy data did not support the discontinuation of the trial on the basis of safety or futility these observations suggested that the trial should be continued in its current form the full data readout from this trial is expected in the middle of  chart chart is expected to be conducted in the united states and europe chart is a  patient prospective controlled randomized doubleblinded trial including nyha class iii and iv ischemic hf patients with each patient having a  chance of being assigned to the ccure treatment group or the control group our investigational new drug application or ind for the use of ccure in chart was initially submitted to the fda in january  this ind became effective in december  for administration of the cells with myostar a catheter used for the injection of therapeutic agents into the heart and manufactured by biologics delivery systems group cordis corporation a johnson  johnson company prior to initiating the trial in september  we filed an amendment to the ind requesting among other changes to the initial submission the use of our proprietary cell injection catheter called ccathez in january  the fda issued a clinical hold on chart most of the clinical hold questions request clarifications on the design dossier of ccathez while the remaining questions relate to providing updated safety information on chart defining chart stopping rules and a request to measure troponin a cardiac marker of injury at day  post baseline procedure we anticipate responding to the clinical hold questions in the third quarter of  once all safety data from chart is available and pending the fda’s lifting of the clinical hold initiating chart during the second half of  car tcell therapy for oncology our approach to car tcell therapy has the potential to treat a wider range of cancers than other car tcell therapies that target the cd antigen or cd car therapy our lead car tcell drug product candidate is carnkgd which has shown promising data in preclinical solid and blood cancer models including for the treatment of lymphoma ovarian cancer and myeloma carnkgd is constructed using the native sequence of nonengineered natural killer or nk cell receptors that target ligands present in numerous cancer cells ligands are substances bound together to form a larger complex such as an antigen bound to other molecules accordingly our technology has the potential to attack and kill a broad range of solid and blood cancers while cd car therapy is typically only effective in treating b lymphocyte or bcell malignancies in preclinical studies treatment with carnkgd significantly increased survival in some studies  of treated mice survived through the followup period of the applicable study which in one study was  days all untreated mice died during the followup period of the applicable study we are currently enrolling patients with certain types of aml or mm in a phase clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of singledose intravenous administration of carnkgd without prior lymphodepletion conditioning which is the destruction of lymphocytes and tcells normally by radiation this trial is being conducted at the dana farber cancer institute in the united states and interim data is expected to be reported throughout the trial with the full data readout expected in the middle of  the first patient was treated in this trial in april  and no treatmentrelated safety concerns were reported during the day followup period a predefined staggered enrollment of two

nkr platform celyad is developing a unique natural killer receptor nkr based tcell platform to target a wide range of solid and hematological tumors unlike traditional cart cell therapy which target only one tumor antigen natural killer nk cell receptors enable a single receptor to recognize multiple tumor antigens celyads lead candidate nkr is a tcell engineered to express the human nk receptor nkgd which is an activating receptor that triggers cell killing through the binding of nkgd to any of eight naturally occurring ligands that are known to be overexpressed on more than  of tumors preclinical results indicate that nkr has multiple mechanism of actions and goes beyond direct killing by signifying that its encoded tcells attack the tumor cells inhibit the mechanisms that enable tumors to evade the immune system activate and recruit antitumor immune cells and disrupt the blood supply to the tumor these mechanisms promote the induction of adaptive immunity meaning the body develops a longterm cell immune memory against specific tumor antigens of the targeted tumor in contrast to traditional cart therapeutic approaches and based on strong preclinical evidence celyads current nkr program does not employ patient lymphodepleting preconditioning thereby avoiding the toxicities associated with chemotherapy and allowing the immune system to remain intact celyad is developing both autologous and allogeneic nkr administrations for autologous nkr celyad collects the patients own tcells and engineers them to express nkgd in order to target cancer cells effectively celyads allogeneic platform engineers the tcells of healthy donors that also express tcr inhibitory molecules tims to avoid having the engineered donor cells be rejected by the patients normal tissues the preclinical research underlying this technology was originally conducted at dartmouth college by dr charles sentman and has been published extensively in peerreviewed publications nkr is currently being tested in a phase i trial in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma patients the trial is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of nkr with secondary endpoints including clinical activity key research investigations include understanding the persistence of nkr cells within the patient about ono pharmaceutical co ltd ono pharmaceutical co ltd headquartered in osaka japan is an
