supercapacitor electrode materials  dayton ohio‚Äîfebruary   nanotek instruments parent company of angstron materials inc has been issued us patent  for its development of a new highperforming class of mesoporous nanocomposites the new nanocomposite provides a superior supercapacitor electrode material for uses that include hybrid electric vehicles evs transportation and energy storage the technology is based on the company‚Äôs breakthrough discovery of nano graphene platelets ngps angstron the world leader in production of ngps will make the nanocomposite material the ngpbased nanocomposite exhibits high levels of capacitance and electrical conductivity as well as demonstrating chemical stability and low mass density both ngps and ngpbased nanocomposites can be mass produced costeffectively when compared to carbon nanotubes and fibers supercapacitors containing this advanced material offer the potential to supplement a battery used in an electric car to provide bursts of power needed for rapid acceleration until now this critical requirement has been the largest technical hurdle to making batterypowered cars commercially viable in addition supercapacitors must also be able to store sufficient energy to provide an acceptable driving range the new ngpbased material makes it possible for a supercapacitor to meet weight and cost targets while combining adequate energy and power with a long cycle life angstron will provide the mesoporous ngp nanocomposites in two forms ngps coated with a thin layer of conducting polymer or surface functional groups and ngps bonded by a conductive binder coating or matrix material such as a polymeric carbon the platelets in these products are comprised of a sheet of graphite plane or multiple sheets of graphite plane with a thickness less than  nm and an average length width or diameter smaller than  nm the binder or matrix material bonded to the platelets to form the nanocomposite material create a surface

and a lower cost‚Äù said dr bor jang ceo and cofounder of angstron angstron developed ngps as an alternative to carbon nanotubes which are difficult to disperse in plastic and often have purity issues‚Äînot to mention the cost factor ngps have been shown to have striking material properties among other things it has the highest intrinsic strength and the highest thermal conductivity of all existing materials as well as exceptional inplane electrical conductivity up to   scmand electron mobility that is  times faster than silicon the ability to chemically functionalize these ngps in a continuous costeffective manner is the next step to broad implementation of this high performing material ‚Äúwe are actively looking for partners interested in jointly developing methods to incorporate ngps into products that require¬†¬†critical performance features and could provide a competitive advantage in today‚Äôs global market‚Äù said jang application examples include the ability to use ngps in aviation against lightening strikes or in fuel tanks¬†¬†the material can be modified to become semiconducting or insulated when needed¬†¬†angstron‚Äôs work supports other aerospace needs such as integration of ngps in thin films or coatings for emi shielding electrostatic spray painting and conductive adhesives as well as composites and thermal management applications¬†¬†work is also underway to integrate ngps in several energy storage and conversion products such as highcapacity lithiumion batteries highcapacity supercapacitors fuel cells wind turbine blades lubricants and solar cells angstron‚Äôs project goals under the award will focus on two primary objectives¬†¬†the advanced materials company will develop methods for massproducing functionalized ngps through the development of scalable surface treatment procedures for both pristine graphene and graphene oxide platelets¬†¬†angstron will also develop an indepth understanding of the relationships between processing shape and structure changes and performance in ngps and ngpcontaining devices or composites for both functional and loadbearing applications angstron materials leads the industry as the only advanced materials company to offer large quantities of both pristine graphene and oxidized graphene multilayer graphene both pristine and oxidized versions are collectively referred to as nano graphene platelets ngps¬†¬†ngps offer improved performance properties including very high young‚Äôs modulus strength and surface area superior thermal and electrical conductivity lower density and less weight¬†¬†ngps are also resistant to gas permeation¬†¬†as a result angstron is able to work with companies to develop products for batteries fuel cells supercapacitors light weight structural components as well as electromagnetic interference emi radio frequency interference rfi electrostatic discharge esd lightning strike and other functional and structural composite applications¬†¬†in addition to its ability to provide sample materials and scaleup angstron partners with customers to help manufacturers identify optimal designs experience with research and development to help manufacturers harness the advantages of nanocompositions and manufacturing processes¬†¬†available in a wide range of geometries ngp products are easily surface functionalizable for polymer and common

layers of graphene plane with a thickness of  nm to  nm singlesheet ngps have demonstrated a much higher thermal conductivity and twice the specific surface areas when compared with singlewalled cnts ngps offer potential for greater performance in a wide range of applications and markets including renewable energy aerospace automotive marine electronics construction medical and telecommunications angstron‚Äôs nanographene material is protected by  us patents and several international patents issued and pending these patents cover various material compositions and processes for ngps ngp nanocomposites and ngpbased devices angstron will invest  in machinery and equipment to expand its manufacturing capacities the city of dayton is supporting the expansion with a  grant from its
