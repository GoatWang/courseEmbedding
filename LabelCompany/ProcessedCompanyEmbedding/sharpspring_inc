sharpspring inc shsp mingran wang value growth long onlymingran wangs blog sitesummarymarketing automation is the future of smart marketing this industry has seen  annual growth in the last few years and is still a fertile ground for much more growthsharpspring which only started  years ago has grown to the  position in the agencies market it has also seen  growth in the last yearmarket didnt fully appreciate the growth because of the past financial metrics but i will list several dynamics that are worth considering for different future expectationsoverall a hardworking owner operator a powerful business model and a fast growing industry can be a powerful combination for a long runway of growthbusiness background marketing automation is a hot industry that has seen very dramatic growth in the last few years the top players such as hubspot nysehubs or marketo have all had fantastic growth around  top line growth per year people are adopting this new way of marketing because more and more customer activities are shifted from offline to online and businesses need a smarter way to do marketing source sharpspring investor presentation december  in this space sharpspring nasdaqshsp is a relatively small player however given that it only launched its first product in   years later than hubspot one could argue that its achievements are also amazing for example i remember acton was a very promising player in the early years and many times bigger than sharpspring however at this time acton is about the same size as sharpspring in the marketing automation space sharpspring is now one of the top  or  players its growth was over  in year  that growth was mostly due to its unique business model leveraging the rd party resources in marketing agencies in any industry it is hard for a small player to fight much bigger competitors this is why sharpsprings founder and ceo rick carlson came up with a very interesting business model by giving marketing agencies  of the cost it will leverage the marketing agencies to do the sales marketing and customer support for him this model is powerful because it suits a small company very well developing the marketing automation business is no easy task big players have significant advantage on marketing and sales after the initial adoption customer support is also very resourceintensive since marketing automation has a big learning curve for most beginners by leveraging the resources of marketing agencies sharpspring will be able to essentially outsource much of the marketing sales and customer support efforts to the rd parties for example after training a marketing agency sharpsprings customer support will be only facing that agency instead of the clients of agencies therefore once the agencies have learned their way they will be providing all the support to their customers and free up the human resources in sharpspring by giving more incentive to agencies sharpspring also enlisted the agencies support on marketing and sales the powerful business model in the business world a lot of things are not just measured by money for example if a company is to grow the operations organically it would take more than just money but also time to reach a certain scale beyond that there is a question of operating efficiencies when managing a much larger company and a question of how easily it can be to down scale the operations when needed this is why i think sharpsprings business model is very powerful essentially it is another form of franchise model where each agency would become a distributor pay a percentage fee based on sales in this case it is a fixed monthly fee based on the number of clients and handle the operations themselves for sure it isnt a franchising model on the surface but the underlying economics are very similar as you can see all the following benefits for the franchising model can also apply here there are many benefits in this model  fast scaleup the franchiser doesnt have to worry about taking the time to build up new shops and hire new employees when a company tries to grow very fast organically it is hard to hire the right people very fast and not potentially leave a nightmare later  efficient management by adopting this fully decentralized model each operating unit is small and can be managed very efficiently the unit is also financially standalone making each unit ownermanager fully motivated  lower capital requirement this model is to enlist many partners and therefore reduce the capital requirement significantly  low operating leverage these partners dont just provide the capital they would share the ongoing risks too this is why the franchiser usually has high gross margin and lower operating leverage  easier to scale down if scaleup for regular businesses is slow and risky the scaledown process if something goes wrong is painful and even more risky it could even kill the firm on the way down especially when they have both high operating leverage and high financial leverage on the contrary a franchiser has much less risks when it does need to scale down the business of course not everything is perfect with this kind of model for instance once you license out to the rd parties you cant directly control the quality of the service so if not doing it carefully it could potentially damage the brand fortunately this is not a big concern for sharpspring since marketing automation is facing marketing professionals agencies instead of consumers the brand is not as useful here when comparing with a regular consumer brand otherwise the smb customers would not look for help from an agency in the first place in general brand is more powerful when facing consumers since consumers usually have less time to do researches to discover the true value of a product what is the market missing this story is not totally new and the company has achieved pretty amazing growth but the share price has been down  in the last  months even though the market has been up so you might be wondering what is going on there and what is the market missing i think there are two main reasons why the shares were down  although the growth has been amazing the company is still not profitable and it has been burning a lot of cash on that growth path  last quarter the growth number has been down sequentially from  customer additions to  additions even though the ceo rick carlson said he expected modest stepup in new enrollment in q  the customer additions were roughly flat over the last  quarters if a company didnt see accelerated growth and also burned a lot of cash it is easy to understand the weakness in the share price i think those concerns are all reasonable and understandable in some sense it is even more assuring because in this market it is hard to believe that the market will completely ignore a fast growing company even when that is a microcap if the shares are not shooting up after high growth there has to be a reason at least the reasons are fairly obvious on the surface that said i believe there are still some dynamics the market has missed by focusing on the past financial metrics  unique positioning everything being equal we would of course want to invest in the market leader but we should also recognize the unique positioning in sharpspring first despite being  times smaller than hubspot in market cap it is the  player in the agencies space for marketing automation it has about  of agency customers when compared with hubspot source sharpspring investor presentation december  second its small size much lower pricing and focus on agencies made big players feel very hard to compete with them third this industry is not as easy to enter as i once believed this is because marketing automation is rather complex and requires many features and components to work together one evidence is that there werent any new players posing threats to sharpspring in the last  years the feature gap is also getting smaller and smaller between hubspot and sharpspring source marketing automation insider all these mean that sharpsprings business model will likely to stay valid for a long time to come the problem it is facing right now is more of a resource and growth speed problem than a competition problem  s curve in growth one interesting phenomena is the s curve in growth this applies to both a new industry and a new firm for marketing automation i think it is still in the early stages especially for smbs most smallmedium businesses are still using traditional marketing methods even the marketing agencies still have many of them not ready to adopt marketing automation yet however this is the future of marketing simply because it is much more powerful while the industry could see a fast adoption phase later a new firm such as sharpspring also has a critical mass to reach at some point the awareness could build on itself  lower churn rate one thing special with marketing automation is that its switching cost is not just high but also gets higher over time the learning curve is usually high for both agencies and their clients but more importantly once it has been used for some time just the existing data stored in this platform itself would provide a strong reason to stay with that platform for this reason the retention rate should get higher over time for instance hubspots quarterly retention rate was in high s in  but got to high s in  and  sharpsprings past monthly churn rate was  but got to  in the last quarter over time it is reasonable to expect it to get even lower than that and this implies both higher net growth and more pricing power  the ecosystem and product differentiation i found it interesting that sharpspring has even more integrations with other platforms than hubspot does as shown below sharpspring has both sap and oracle integrations but hubspot doesnt recently it also added integrations with shutterstock enthusem and piesync this can build out an ecosystem and can have more product differentiation further improving its competitive strength for the long term source marketing automation insider  capital free growth and margin expansion one good thing about sharpsprings model is that marketing agencies will try to grow their own businesses and when they grow it will add to sharpsprings revenue over time this is essentially what i call capitalfree growth also since sharpspring only provides support to agencies but not to agencies clients there is some potential margin expansion when the agencies client base gets bigger growing revenue but not growing operating expenses proportionally another important thing to point out is that the new customers additions dont include the additions of agencies clients although those additions have much lower pricing than direct sales it still provides a lot of values first it is capitalfree growth second it boosts the awareness and market share finally it will also help agencies to focus on sharpspring instead of other competitors  the current cash balance is likely to be enough to fund the future growth and get to cash flow breakeven at the end of  the company has m cash and no debt but since the company has just paid m tax in  as shown in the cash flow statement because of the divestiture of the smtp business it is likely to get back much of the tax in the next few years in fact there is m tax receivable in the current asset for this reason i expect the company will have a total of  million cash to fund the growth this  million cash is not the current cash balance but the cash available to be used in the next few years to sustain the cash burn as shown in the table above as the company grows its scale its operating losses will get smaller and smaller in my estimation its likely to achieve positive ebitda within    years even if we assume no churnrate reduction and no accelerated growth and the current cash should be enough to fund the growth in that time frame the last quarter had about m cash burn but since this figure is getting smaller over time we may expect  million is enough for the next  years all in all although the past growth has been flat it doesnt mean the future growth will stay at the same rate and not accelerate instead in the following figure we can see although the revenue addition has been flat quarter to quarter in  there was a major stepup when comparing between  and  in  the average revenue addition per quarter was   m but this figure grows to   m per quarter in  source sharpspring investor presentation december  risks as any early stage growth companies there is significant risk involved in this company the main risk is the uncertainty around the growth rate it is very hard to predict what the future growth rate will look like if the company cant grow fast enough the cash burn may be even more than my conservative estimation and we may see further dilutions in unfavorable terms valuation first before closing down graphicmail and selling smtp there were  businesses entangled together and very hard to see the trend clearly this has changed a lot since june  since the sale of smtp happened in june  and migration of graphicmail to sharpspring mail happened in the first half  too because sharpspring mail revenue is only about k per quarter the q  financial statements should fully reflect the true economics of the sharpspring marketing automation product currently hubspot is being traded at  times of sales this seems to be reasonable given the fast growing industry its past  per year growth and long runway in the future although sharpspring doesnt possess the same market leading position and the same liquidity it could have higher growth prospective and slightly more pricing power since its price for agencies is only  of its competitors the agencies are relatively price insensitive given the lower base price should both sharpspring and its competitors increase their prices at the same percentage as it grows at some point it may achieve similar awareness and much better liquidity to support a higher ps valuation than what it has now in a pretty conservative scenario we estimate the revenue has the same linear growth as in  for the next  years and also achieve positive ebtida in  years this estimation essentially assumes the same linear growth instead of exponential growth and no reduction in churn rate assumes churn rate to fix at  the net revenue addition is assumed to be m per quarter after  quarters the runrate revenue would be m  m      m per year and  times of sales instead of  times in hubspots valuation is m    m market cap diluted share base is assumed to be  million shares after  years the share price would be m  m   discount this back  years at  discount rate gives      or  upside from the current price  in a more aggressive scenario we assume revenue grows  per year in the next  years which matches hubspots past growth this  per year growth assumption shouldnt be too aggressive since the  revenue growth was  the revenue after  years will be       m notice that this figure is not much more than the m in the linear growth scenario if it trades at  times of sales or  times of gross profit it would have a market cap of m or m  m   share price discount this back  years gives       fair value or  upside conclusion generally speaking it is very hard to value a high growth company especially for an early stage one both the risk and the reward could be very big for this kind of situation it is probably better to take the same strategy as regular vc firms build a small position and hold onto it for many years or even decades i do think this specific case stand out by itself for a powerful combination of  elements which i usually look for  a smart founder operator who works very hard and focused on investing for the long term in terms of ownership the ceo rick carlson owns  of the company which is not very high but that is due to a special situation smtp bought sharpspring in  we shouldnt forget the fact that he founded this firm by himself and saw it growing to this stage he cares about providing the best service to customers and worked very hard on educating the public about sharpspring and marketing automation as shown in a recent presentation he did in an izea fest event  a pretty unique business model that has many merits and could serve as a foundation to power the growth without taking a lot of resources this business model gives the firm a unique position to effectively compete with the market leader  a fast growing industry everything being equal the industry growth can provide some very powerful tail wind of course that usually has to be coupled with good competitive strength in order to be sustainable for a firm other than the long growth pathway it is also quite possible to see a potential acquisition here

over the last several years as the below graphic illustrates bought up by the company smtp in august  sharpspring during the next year effectively ate its parent company up from the inside out as ceo rick carlson noted when smtp changed its name to that of its erstwhile purchase sharpspring went from being the smallest piece of the overall business to the largest piece this is an impressive feat made all the more so since it was achieved in just over a year shsp was bought by smtp in august  and by december st  the company had rebranded under the sharpspring banner shsp history  source tech

sharpspring operates in it is true already has several market leaders and the company might be considered too small to properly compete in the marketing automation sector that said sharpsprings agency and small business focus gives it a niche in which to operate focusing on selling to agencies which represent small businesses allows the company to keep costs low and channels its reach beyond what it could do on its own shsps agency figures the number of digital agencies it sells to on its books is actually quite a meaningful proportional share of the market sharpspring currently has  agencies on its books and a total of  business users furthermore the growth of shsps customer base from  at the end of  to  by the start of  is an excellent years work this means that by the end of

total revenue at  down from  and yearly gross profits were up  at m yearly gross margins have however fallen as growthtargeted spending increases the downside is that as a company sharpspring still makes a net loss reporting q losses of m or  a share and yearly losses of m or  a share its worth noting however that these figures are improvements of  percent and  percent respectively ebita losses disappointingly rose from m to m  whilst core losses excluding amortization acquisitionrelated costs stock compensation expenses and restructuring expenses remained stable in value terms at m but fell per share from  to   shsp forecast earnings source nasdaq there are reasons to be cautious about an investment in sharpspring the company despite its excellent performance is in terms of spending power a sheep amidst the wolves of the industry any investment at present especially if long term in nature risks dilution given that sharpspring is betting on an adjusted ebitda breakeven point being reached in q  cash reserves are falling down from m in q to m in q  if this trend continues by q  cash reserves will have dwindled to just over m and although cfo ed lawton expects cash on hand and shsps available credit facility to remain an adequate source of funds mediumterm profitability is absolutely key to the companys strategy furthermore owing to the companys size sharpspring might find itself forced to accept an ma offer below a fair value which would in turn damage any potential stock investment the above said with consolidation out of the way and renewed focus generated by the fact that sharpspring now has a single purpose the growth of its marketing platform there is plenty of upside potential for the company targeted investments have been made to support infrastructure

are from a longterm perspective broadly positive it is only possible to speculate as to the cause for the recent slump investor impatience or worries about sharpsprings longterm profitability given the decline in the companys cash reserves are certainly possible causes for shsps plunging share price according to stockinvestus trading volume in shsp has also concurrently increased however on falling prices this increases the risk of the selloff around st patricks day continuing since january sharpspring has been slowly declining in value with a february rally seemingly now going into
