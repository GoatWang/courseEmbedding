the wallboard maker’s future strategy how he makes tough decisions and his father’s influence on him by julie segal metcalf has taken several measures to encourage innovation at usg photo courtesy subject page  of  the night before usg corp ceo james metcalf met warren buffett for the first time he couldnt sleep i was scared to death says metcalf who was then president of the wallboard maker buffetts berkshire hathaway had bought  million worth of convertible notes from usg in  when the company was reeling from the housing crisis but metcalf says the berkshire chairman and ceo immediately put him at ease offering up great ideas and asking spoton questions these days metcalf still cant sleep before he sees buffett who is usgs largest shareholder with a stake of approximately  percent but now its because of excitement you always get an invaluable nugget from him says metcalf  he admires buffetts accessibility  the legendary investor always takes metcalfs calls he was shocked when buffett once offered to drive him to the airport in omaha nebraska but he realized that the investor makes sure he gets out in the world and learns as much as he can from people metcalf prides himself on his ability to field ideas from all over usg and from its customers avoiding the isolation many ceos face even with the recent unrest in thailand where we now have operations i went directly to the general manager and he gave the perspective of whats happening on the streets on the other side of the world metcalf explains i wanted to hear it directly the usg chief executive has spent his entire career at the chicagobased company after graduating from ohio state university in  with a ba in criminal justice metcalf  who grew up in toronto ohio the son of a steelworker  drove from pittsburgh to los angeles to try to persuade a usg manager to hire him as a sales trainee even though the opening had been filled metcalf was determined checking in every few weeks after several months one of the trainees quit and metcalf got his offer he rose through usgs ranks holding positions in sales marketing and strategy in  metcalf became chief operating officer of lw supply corp usgs distribution company he became lws ceo a year later he was named president of usgs building systems unit in  two years later he became president of the company he says hes never asked anybody to do anything he hasnt done himself some of the big changes weve made over the past five years weve embraced in part because people knew i didnt come parachuting in from a consulting firm with crazy ideas he explains i can shoot emails out to the field or to customers to see whats really going on new ideas have been essential for usg whose initials stand for united states gypsum a yearold company that is one of the largest makers of gypsum wallboard in north america and the uss biggest distributor of drywall and building products that distinction put it at the center of the decadeslong fight over asbestos a fireprevention material that was a minor ingredient in its wallboard but later proved to cause certain types of cancer usg sought bankruptcy protection from asbestos litigation in  it emerged from chapter  in  paying  billion to the plaintiffs bar to settle all future claims but the massive payment came  months before the worst housing crisis since the great depression in  usg sold  million worth of notes to investors including buffetts berkshire to help keep itself afloat the notes have since been converted to stock metcalf took over as ceo on january   succeeding william foote who had run the company for  years and managed through the recession by cutting costs and closing less efficient plants the company was suffering with revenues in all three segments  housing repair and remodel and commercial construction  down by about half when metcalf took the top job he had to think through the companys core businesses shed what wasnt central and evaluate viable options for expanding and diversifying its revenue base i really appreciate the heritage of the company but i knew i had to do something different so we could be more agile he says by the first quarter of  the company was profitable again at a recent price of  its shares have nearly doubled since metcalf became chief executive senior writer julie segal recently met with the ceo at institutional investors offices metcalf talked about usgs future strategy how he makes tough decisions and his fathers influence on him institutional investor usg has been through some tough times what was it like during the depths of the housing pullback metcalf i was president in the middle of this small d depression im really big on strategy and thinking a thousand days out we put together a strategy team to say what do we need to do to differentiate ourselves what is core we identified our north american manufacturing and distribution as core  that was the cash cow but they were under attack because of the depression so we idled highcost plants and delayered the organization its like going in and getting a physical but then you have to put yourself through a plan what wasnt core i first looked at europe we had a business there but it didnt have critical mass or a full product line and we didnt have the balance sheet to make a big acquisition lafarge the cement company was divesting its wallboard business but the timing was bad for us at the same time europe is aging quickly and the macroeconomics didnt excite me were driven by household formation and the like we decided we couldnt win and sold our european assets in  we took those resources and reinvested in the middle east asia and australia weed and feed i call it in that fastgrowing part of the world we could win i wanted to think big start out incremental and move fast i still didnt have a lot of resources so we invested in oman and started putting a footprint in india youve taken a unique approach to emerging markets by establishing joint ventures including one with australian buildingmaterials maker boral why these markets are very fragmented  great for diversifying our earnings but hard to get a foothold in we just entered into a  joint venture with boral which gives us a  percent market share in  countries every countrys economy is a little different indonesia is extremely busy australia is flat south korea is a little bit like the us up somewhat vietnam is emerging china is china but people ask how an american company can win there what do we know about vietnam well now we have partners that have been there for  years and they wanted us for our technology and our innovation technology innovation isnt the first thing that springs to mind when i think of usg well we are an innovator absolutely we introduced a product here in the midst of the recession that took a third out of the weight of the product if you look at plasterboard its two sheets of paper with plaster of paris in the middle we figured out a way to take out a third of the weight while keeping its strength intact in the far east where its very humid everything sags our partners wanted this innovation and paid us for it in fact the jv was kicked off when the ceo of boral called me to ask how he could get ultralight as its called ultralight really strengthened our north american business in new york city where drywall hangers make  an hour its also huge as workers can do more in less time how does your company foster innovation and new ideas we have approximately  people in our research center we also partner with universities tapping into their phd programs its called open innovation we copied startups operating in silicon valley we wanted new and different ideas and from a financial standpoint it variablized a fixed cost if business gets better we get more interns from the phd program business slows up we get fewer we did this through the recession because we had to create our own recovery our shareholders shouldnt say jims job is to wait for the recovery we wanted to create it so you want to make usg less cyclical yes otherwise shareholders say whats management doing we diversified our earnings adding  countries were focusing on innovation and coming out with a new mousetrap like ultralight the third area is were using technology to tie together our entire network our business is very regional texas might be busier than the pacific northwest we run a network so were always delivering at the lowest manufacturing and delivery cost now think of this you take out a third of the weight you get a third more on a truck our distributors need a third less equipment ultralight saves you fuel is more sustainable and has a smaller carbon footprint everyone thought wallboard was a commodity but we changed the rules single page       sponsored video get started subscribe show me all of my options

like to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask questions so as always when we get to the qa session callers are asked to limit themselves to one question jim james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you ryan and good morning let me start by saying we had a very strong quarter and half way through the year were really seeing momentum build in all of our businesses we had the best adjusted net income since the fourth quarter of  the fourth quarter of  think of that thats when they were over  million homes being built we had growth and expanded our margins in all of our businesses and our usg boral joint venture continues to grow im looking forward to reviewing these wonderful results and taking your questions but first id like to take a minute and touch on our strategy usg has a history of leading the building products industry our gypsum ceilings and distribution businesses now coupled with usg boral in asia and australasia are successfully building on our history by executing our plan to win by strengthening the core of our north american manufacturing and distribution businesses diversifying our earnings base through usg boral and differentiating through worldclass innovation we at usg are building a stronger and leaner company the story on usg today in  is both positive and id like to say straightforward we expect demand improvement coupled with expanding operating margins which youre going to see in the current results and going forward we will generate the levels of free cash flow to support our debt paydown strategy and continue to reinvest and grow our business now lets turn to some details of the quarter in our gypsum segment all three of our businesses wallboard surfaces and substrates contributed to achieving the best adjusted operating margin since  in wallboard increased volume lower nat gas costs and cost reductions through our lean six sigma programs drove margin expansion in  million of improved profitability surfaces and substrates which are critical components of our gypsum segment these are products like our leading market share joint treatment and our growth product commercial roof board they provide a full portfolio of products for our customers these important products and sales of these brands drove  million of incremental profit and the volume of our securock commercial roof board hit record levels during the quarter moving to ceilings we saw margin expansion improving to just over  ceilings earned  million in adjusted operating profit improvements came from pricing and cost for ceiling tile that drove performance over a very strong  comp second quarter now to lw supply we continue to see improving trends with operating margins more than doubling in the quarter comp store sales increased  and wallboard volume was up  adjusted operating profit of  million is the highest in over seven years while im very pleased that were moving in the right direction at lw we still arent to our expected roic targets and we still have some work ahead of us but were making progress usg boral turned in another strong quarter with adjusted operating margin breaking to  we continue to see conversion of our standard plasterboard to our ultralight or in that part of the world nextgen board during the quarter adjacent product volume grew led by joint treatment with australia being the strongest market growing at  per adjacent products realizing synergies in our combined business has been a major focus and we are tracking ahead of schedule and im very pleased with those results in fact  months into the joint venture we now estimate that usg boral has realized  of the targeted  million that weve talked about in past calls before matt takes a detailed look into our second quarter results id like to update you on our plan to win last quarter if you recall i reviewed our advancements in part of our plan to win on strengthening our core as we continue to make progress in north american manufacturing and distribution and you see those in the results today id like to review how we differentiate through innovation and specifically come back to our substrates business while wallboard and surfaces primarily are installed in the interior of either a residential or commercial building many of our substrates products are used in the exterior envelope of a commercial building last month we partnered with tremco which is part of rpm international out of ohio and we announced a new exterior air and water barrier system with the product that we call securock exoair  this innovation answers the challenges that our customers have been having with existing systems and bringing them a better solution with this new product the air barrier system is preapplied during the manufacturing process compared to being sprayed on the job site this makes it easier to install with less material waste and provides a better system for our customer and the owner of the building as youve seen in our ultralight portfolio products ease of installation is key for our customers particularly commercial construction where labor rates are extremely high and usg premium products help reduce those labor costs were in an introduction phase of this system but the customer response has been great and im very excited about rolling this product out throughout the country product innovations in growth businesses like substrates give us a larger share of wallet in that commercial business that helps diversify our earnings before i turn it over to matt to talk more about the details i want to cover one of additional topic there was a hearing last week to approve the settlement of our antitrust class actions and given that no one came to the hearing to object we are very optimistic that the settlement will be approved in addition weve become aware that a federal grand jury is investigating domestic wallboard manufacturers including us gypsum over what appears to be the same issues raised in these class actions were fully cooperating obviously with this investigation and as weve said in the past and this is very important we establish our pricing and selling practices independently and are in full compliance with the law we do not expect this investigation to have a significant incremental impact on our financial results so with that id like to turn it over to matt who will dig into the financial results for the quarter and ill come back with some comments before qa matt matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks jim and good morning everyone ill kick things off by walking through our consolidated results for the second quarter our gaap net sales were up  to  million and our gaap net income was  million with diluted earnings per share of  before discussing our adjusted results ill offer a brief reminder that beginning with this quarter our current and prior period results exclude the results from gtl our shipping operation that we exited in april earlier this year in addition we do not expect any continuing financial impact of gtl going forward so in order to compare our sales and earnings on an applestoapples basis in this quarter and all quarters going forward our adjusted sales and earnings numbers exclude all gtl activity so with that said adjusted sales for the second quarter improved over  and we saw margins expand across all of our businesses our adjusted operating profit improved by almost  and our adjusted net income of  million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of  were up  over the prior year and we generated  million in adjusted ebitda our highest since the fourth quarter of  and almost  higher than the second quarter of last year so lets move to our segment discussions and ill start with gypsum during the second quarter we saw a significant margin expansion and operating leverage with  million of improved adjusted operating profit to  million adjusted operating margins improved by  basis points over last year to  due to a combination of improved volumes higher prices and lower costs plus were seeing very solid growth in our nonwallboard surfaces and substrate divisions which ill discuss in a moment let me give you a little bit more detail regarding our us operations in our us wallboard division volumes for the second quarter were up  slightly above the industry and price was stable from our first quarter of this year we also continue to see lower costs which contributed  million in improved operating profit in the quarter lower natural gas represented about half of that favorability with the other piece coming from a combination of our operational efficiency efforts or raw material costs including waste paper im very pleased to note that our surfaces and substrate divisions added  million of operating profit over last year across a broad platform of new and existing products including increased volumes and pricing in fiberock and securock roofing products plus improved volumes of joint compound coupled with better pricing and lower costs due to efficiencies id also like to highlight that were providing new incremental disclosures on our surfaces and substrates division starting this quarter so you can better see the value that these businesses drive specifically we will now quantify their sales volumes and their relative ebitda contributions as you can see in our slide presentation surfaces and substrates is a substantial part of our portfolio with about  of us gypsums revenues they had strong top line growth of  to generate  million in sales during the quarter and they represent approximately  of the ebitda generated by the us gypsum company or about  million the margins on surfaces and substrates are a bit lower than wallboard but they are really fairly stable over the cycle so im pleased with how these businesses are performing and their potential for the future moving to ceilings our operating margins for the second quarter expanded by  basis points to over  generating  million of adjusted operating profit during the quarter we continued to see some mix shift to higher margin products with premium tile products now representing roughly a third of our tile portfolio improved pricing was led by our tile products with the majority of the increase driven by mix shift and as we just saw in the gypsum segment lower natural gas cost combined with our continuing lean six sigma efforts drove costs lower and expanded our margins turning to distribution lw earned  million in adjusted operating profit a  million improvement over the second quarter of last year we saw increased volumes in wallboard and our other core products and we were able to capitalize on those increased volumes this quarter samestore sales were up  led by wallboard volumes of  and delivery costs on a percentage of sales basis were flat and as jim said we certainly have more work to do but real progress is being made moving to our last business segment our usg boral jv adjusted operating profit for the total jv was  million up  million from a year ago with operating margins expanding to about  please note that the  basis point improvement and operating margin is really closer to  basis points when you adjust for the roughly  million in facility damage costs incurred in last years second quarter even so thats really terrific growth usgs share of the jvs net income amounted to  million in the second quarter of this year a  million improvement almost all of which was driven by the jvs strong operational improvements that jim mentioned earlier regarding dividends from the jv we did receive our first dividend from the jv in may amounting to  million this is the first of many dividends that we expect to get as we are targeting to pay out at least  of the jvs earnings going forward as i said in the past the jv is expected to be completely self funding including capital needs and the potential earnout payments to boral so as of now the dividends are being held overseas to fund the expected earnout payments to boral ill shift gears and now share a few thoughts on our financial outlook for the year on the sga front last quarter i said that we were scaling back our sga spending for  by at least  million to  million for the full year this quarter i can reiterate that we are fully committed to meeting or beating the  million target for the year regarding the second quarter total sga spend was in line with our expectations at  million as i mentioned on our last call the spending pattern for this year is expected to be different than last year with slightly higher spend in the second and third quarters with significantly less spend in the fourth quarter regarding taxes i want to reiterate that based on our forecasted profitability in the us we are still projecting that we will release nearly all our portion of our  billion domestic valuation allowance by the end of  and in fact we may see a portion of that release coming as early as next quarter again this is actually very good news as its based on positive earnings growth as a reminder when we release all or a portion of our valuation allowance well realize a massive noncash income tax benefit connected with the reversal of the reserves and then beginning in  well start to record income tax expense on the pl for substantially all of our us earnings but whats really important here is that we will not let me repeat we will not pay cash taxes until we fully utilize our  billion of net operating losses and other carryover benefits so simply put this does not impact cash only the pl from an income tax expense standpoint we anticipate our annual global effective tax rate will be between  and  there will also be no impact to the results of usg boral which are recorded net of tax and there is no new impact to canada and mexico as we already record tax expense on those countries for the remainder of  and until we release the valuation allowance expect that our tax expense to amount to roughly  million a quarter let me address foreign exchange exposure as well across the whole usg portfolio including usg boral fx headwinds amounted to about  million for the quarter and about  million on a yeartodate basis about half of the  million is for canada and the remaining half is split equally between mexico and the jv looking at the back half or the second half of this year we think there is additional exposure of about  million to  million assuming rates stay stable for the balance of the year and taking into consideration the hedges that we already have in place a final point on outlook we are absolutely committed to organically delevering our balance sheet we have some upcoming debt payments and in particular our  million bullet that is due in november of next year which is clearly in our sites we have additional debt that we will also pay down as we march towards our leverage target of  times to  times debt to ebitda at the midcycle and with that ill turn things back to jim james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you matt before we go into qa id like to briefly discuss what we see in our end markets and share some of our insights of what we expect for the balance of this year and going forward let me start out with new residential and probably a lot of this isnt new news to you i think were looking at the same numbers but our forecast is for the year  million starts as you know some of the low seasonally adjusted starts earlier in the year were skewed by weather but we do see positive signs we see demand increasing for firsttime homebuyers which has been really a key area with firsttime homebuyers increasing to over   of sales and thats up from  a year ago were also seeing strong job growth which has helped return homebuilder confidence to the highest levels in nearly a decade now in new commercial were expecting mid to single digit growth for  with usgs primary sectors of growth would be education which is the largest sector under the commercial umbrella followed by office and retail another encouraging sign that we saw yesterday and many of you probably did is the abi reading that hit its highest level since mid which is another encouraging sign that commercial is starting to show some life were well below historical levels in commercial but we feel that were in the early stages of recovery and this is very important sector in our business repair and remodel which to remind you is about  of usgs business and we see continued growth in  and beyond existing home sales drives rr spending as buyers typically remodel their homes of first  months to  months after a purchase and our products typically are involved in that remodel project in addition commercial repair and remodel employment levels continue to improve as youve all seen and one really important thing that were starting to see is office vacancy rates have dropped to  which is actually the lowest level since  so all in both residential and commercial repair and remodel we expect low to mid single digit growth in  with usg boral – and matt touched on the great progress were making there and were very enthusiastic about that partnership were forecasting mid to high single digit growth and we expect continued margin expansion as i mentioned earlier the value proposition of our nextgen plasterboard relative to standard board has been a key part of this growth and improving our margins but also level setting all those manufacturing plants with the usg manufacturing way has really helped usg boral lower manufacturing costs as well as commercial buildings in that part of the world are being designed more and more with western construction practices the demand for usg boral products including the adjacent products that are very very important ceiling tile grid and fiberock are going to add to that growth so all in all were very optimistic about the year i think weve had a really good quarter were excited about the opportunities that weve shared with you today and with that id like to open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from bob wetenhall from rbc capital markets please go ahead robert wetenhall  rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone and congratulations on a very strong quarter james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you bob robert wetenhall  rbc capital markets llc i just wanted to ask you i havent heard you this enthusiastic i dont remember and thanks for the color on the end market demand thats really helpful can you help me understand how you see among your three businesses the recovery like engaging each of those businesses and im just trying to understand from your perspective what are you most excited about right now in the portfolio and how do you think the recovery unfolds does the gypsum business engage first followed by lw how should we thinking about the trajectory of that thanks very much james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer okay bob thank you yes actually im very excited you look at the quarter we had its the best quarter since  which we basically had  million housing starts and that was a whole different environment i think one of the keys has been lowering the breakeven and all the cost reduction and hard work that this organization has done over the last few years that just shows the amount of leverage we have actually what im most excited about is seeing commercial coming back weve taken the term choppy out weve used that term choppy commercial is very very important for lw supply weve repositioned lw as i said we arent where we need to be but were making progress its very important for our ceilings business and quite frankly its important for our gypsum wallboard business so thats been the lagging factor if you look at commercial i talked about abi consumer confidence is up  yearonyear and vacancy rates which i think are very very important one other thing were seeing in commercial if you look around the highrise construction a lot of the highrise construction today falls in the residential numbers but theyre mostly rentals or highrise rentals which lw plays a key part in with steel studs commercial insulation and commercial products now on the other side of that theres not ceilings in those highrise rentals so you have to kind of look at those highrise residential units almost like a commercial unit so allinall im really excited about seeing some life in commercial it has a big impact on our businesses and we think residential is going to continue to grow so were going to continue to take costs out introduce new products and hopefully deliver the results that weve done this quarter as we go forward robert wetenhall  rbc capital markets llc thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from philip ng from jefferies please go ahead philip ng  jefferies llc hey good morning guys congrats on the strong quarter based on the hedges you guys have in place do you expect to see a comparable amount of benefit from lower natural gas and with waste paper prices rising do you expect incrementals youve seen in gypsum in q to be sustainable in the back half matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey phil its matt hilzinger why dont i take that as jim said we continue to do everything we can to lower the breakeven and we saw some good cost momentum in the first quarter i think in the gypsum business we saved like  million yearoveryear and now in this quarter its about  million and i would split half of that in natural gas id put a little bit in – some benefits that weve gotten around raw materials and then i think were getting the efficiencies if you think about  fixed cost and  conversion were going to leverage somewhere between  and  as volume goes through and all the cost efficiencies that were going so in the second half of the year what i would think is look were going to continue to get some leverage on the fixed costs and get our improvements i think were going to have some tailwinds on natural gas not as big as we saw in the first half this quarter in particular we benefited from kind of a very low spot rate so  of our natural gas was unhedged we took advantage of a very low spot rate thats moved up from about  to about  to  i think well still get a little bit of a tailwind in the second half but were still seeing some inflation were seeing inflation in synthetic gypsum were seeing inflation in labor weve had that and were seeing some inflation in some of our special ingredients so all in all what i would think about as you think about the second half is i think youd probably see costs maybe go up a little bit in the second half compared to last year maybe flat best case but i think there are some good tailwinds and look were doing everything we possibly can in this company to manage costs and so thats what were trying to do philip ng  jefferies llc very helpful can you just provide some color on how the hedges are set up in the back half and going into next year matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah very similar to the way they were set up in the first half se were about  hedged so our allin hedged price right now is around  if we continue to have spot prices of call it   i think that will translate into maybe  million to  million a quarter on natural gas benefit so not quite as much as we saw this quarter but i think well get a little bit of a benefit philip ng  jefferies llc okay thanks a lot very helpful matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president yep operator thank you our next question comes from garik shmois from longbow please go ahead garik s shmois  longbow research llc hi thanks congratulations just a question on surfaces and substrates and youre offering bit more disclosure on that and we appreciate it it looks like you did  incremental margins in that business this quarter recognized that over the course of the cycle its less volatile from a margin standpoint relative to wallboard but that  figure is pretty impressive you called out a couple of items that contributed to the profit growth but im just wondering as were starting to see that business inflect is there any sort of additional guidance you could point us towards incremental margins in that business james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer we really appreciate the – looking at the us gypsum business in a different way and thats one reason garik that we wanted to unpack that a little bit for you and one of the key areas is we have competitive situations that we want to keep proprietary these are industry leading products we have loyalty from our applicators we have a very strong market share most of those products have a market share thats x over wallboard and as you say less volatile margins so were going to crawl before we walk there we wanted to open up the envelope a little bit so you can understand the gypsum margins i think sometimes us gypsum gets compared to other companies that dont have these products and i think the key here is you have strong market share loyal brands and the volatility of the margins if you go back to three years or four years ago they were rock stars in the portfolio because gypsum margins were lower so you can go back  years or  years and those margins really stay relatively in a small span so we want to give you this first round and we just want to make sure that things that we provide arent proprietary – that we want to keep proprietary that give us a competitive advantage in the market garik s shmois  longbow research llc okay theres nothing in that business that would suggest a breakout form the kind of the historical margin standard deviation though james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer no the surfaces business is – that is joint treatment thats the green lid – were continuing to expand weve probably introduced more new products in surfaces and substrates in the last year which we really dont talk about a lot of line extensions its really taking costs out these are very – for example joint treatment are very regional products so if youre in the desert you have to have a different formula than if youre along the coast so were always expanding the formula breakout products and really the area that im most excited about is substrates its a growth business the commercial roof deck business our market share is fairly low but weve been growing at doubledigit rates and when you look at the amount of commercial roofs that need to be repaired and replaced the average age of a commercial building is  years old so if you say breakout i mean that substrates group is really an exciting group of – when we talk about surfaces and substrates that were continuing to introduce new products the one that i talked about it with tremco is very early we dont know how big thats going to be but that could be something that gets attention so joint treatment very stable growth leading market share is continuing new products but substrates is a part of it that – i dont know if im going to call it breakout but its a very exciting growth initiative in the us gypsum segment matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president and jim let me add this is matt if you look at the  million that came through on surfaces and substrates about half of that was volume and the other half was split equally between kind of price increases that weve gotten and efficiency so weve reduced costs so weve expanded margins in that business but were also getting very good volume as i said weve gotten about  topline growth so garik s shmois  longbow research llc great thanks for that operator thank you our next question comes from tim wojs from baird please go ahead tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah hey guys nice job on the cost side james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you tim tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker i guess just a question on gypsum volumes some other people in the industry have talked about a little bit of impact on the commercial construction side that may have delayed some construction activity timelines im just curious if thats something that you guys saw in any sort of regions across the country james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah obviously texas houston got a ton of rain and thats slowed up a lot of commercial buildings in that texas oklahoma areas so absolutely tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker and i guess is there any way to think about – does that kind of help in as you get into the back half of the year is that kind of something that winds up kind of shifting demand a little bit in the  james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer our projections for the year really havent changed i think its just – it may be a quarter shift here and there but things get delayed and it will be just a little bit of catchup in the quarter tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike wood from macquarie please go ahead mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc hi thanks for taking my question on lw you cited the flat delivery cost as percentage of sales im just wondering if you can comment on what you could do further and improve that margin profile and whether or not there has been any products folded into that segment recently to help accelerate the growth james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer mike this is jim from your question on the products lw we really focus on seven core products we arent really big in lumber thats why we dont play in the resi side steel studs commercial insulation largest distributor of ceiling tile and grid in the country so we want to be the best at the seven core products so no nothing gets folded in i mean fasteners and things of that nature but the seven core products are something we want to stay very focused on on delivery that is a real focus area for us we have really three areas were looking at logistics were looking at inventory and were looking at branch rationalization so on the logistics its things like truck turnaround loading trucks faster safer so thats all the key to how long it takes us to – can we get an extra turnin if you get an extra turnin at a branch that really helps the profitability so we are all over that we have a lean six sigma team thats focused on that and thats really key to the profitability of how efficient and safely that you can deliver products mike wood  macquarie capital usa inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike dahl from credit suisse please go ahead matt a bouley  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi this is actually matt bouley on for mike thank you for taking my question just going back to the nonres environment just given some of that improving data and thinking about your  million sga target for the year what would happen to sga if you did see an acceleration in volumes in the second half and how would you think about potentially adding shifts or capacity in that environment thanks james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer were very focused on sga and as matt said we expect to hit that  million regardless of where volume comes thats the key thats why we have leverage and were delivering the same earnings that we did in  and any type of volume increase we do not expect sga ill turn over to matt he can talk about our philosophy on shifts matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah matt any shifts that we might add actually go through cost of the sales they arent going to run through sga and quite frankly weve got very strong – weve got a lot of capacity right now our effective capacity is running around  almost  a little stronger in some parts of the country little less in others we typically will run that up to over  and then maybe add a shift and one of the things that were very focused on is through lean six sigma what were doing in the manufacturing environment is when we bring a shift back one we know that its durable demand but two were doing things to drive efficiency so we just – we dont want to bring a lot of people on and then at some point have to maybe let them go if demand is not there so on the sga target as jim said we are laserfocused on our costs and in the plants weve got plenty of capacity to meet demand should something spike up in the second half or either next year so i feel very good about where we are in costs james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer and just to follow up on the adding a shift just so everyone – we are adding some capacity in southern california and this is highend specialty products that we had to ship from texas so this is a something that its our glassmat product its something that product that is high margin high demand in that part of the world and we took a very focused approach about putting a specialty product in that part of the world so if you hear about that that is what we are doing in our plaster city california plant matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president and just add on to that that glassmat panel is the green stuff its the green panels that you see when youre driving around not the yellow stuff yellow is bad green is good matt a bouley  credit suisse securities usa llc broker got it thank you and good luck operator thank you our next question comes from stephen kim from barclays please go ahead stephen s kim  barclays capital inc thanks very much guys yeah i guess first question i just wanted to sort of clean up on the nat gas and the hedging obviously youve sort of laid out what you thought it might be for the next couple of quarters but if im not mistaken i mean if nat gas sort of stays where we are i mean would it be your expectation that youd see a pretty meaningful benefit in  james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer hey stephen how are you stephen s kim  barclays capital inc doing great thanks james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer good look we have not provided guidance on  but i think directionally youre correct i mean i think if prices stay low we would end up with some kind of tailwind in  i think its too early to get into exactly what that would be but clearly i think there is some opportunity to get some tailwind there but were also seeing some inflation right so that would help offset whatever inflation we might see on the labor on the synthetic gypsum side stephen s kim  barclays capital inc got it great and then secondly with respect to the q james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer stephen excuse me this stephen s kim  barclays capital inc thats right forgot it one question my apologies james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer thats okay we have a few people in queue so i apologize stephen s kim  barclays capital inc no its fine thanks james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thanks operator thank you our next question comes from dennis mcgill from zelman  associates please go ahead dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates hi good morning thanks guys matt i guess just one question i had with respect to how to interpret the samestore sales trends within the distribution business it sounds like that the data you guys were seeing on the nonres youre comfortable that thats accelerating and i know thats got a tilt towards nonres but your samestore sales went from  last quarter to  this quarter is there something unique in the comparisons or anything that youre seeing in the business that would kind of explain that variance and then maybe if you see some acceleration coming in the second half of the year there matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president no the way i would think about it and i hate to drag  into the conservation but i think you got to go back to  in  the first quarter was really pretty light right so we had – if you fast forward to the first quarter of this year wallboard volumes were up close to  and i think part of that i think if you go back what we said was part of that volume increase that we saw in the first quarter was in part due to the weather and the polar vortex that we saw in  so i think when you think about going from  to  on wallboard volumes and you think about the comp store sales i think they kind of flow together and so i think part of this is weaker first quarter last year against this year stronger second quarter against our second quarter this year and so i go back to what jim said in terms of the guidance for the balance of the year housing starts up between  million and  million i think were in the midpoint there about  million mid single on commercial and low to mid on residential i think if you blend all that together youre kind of in the midsingle digit on volume growth and i think lw is getting a benefit from the highrise resi that jim called out right i mean if you take a look at the housing starts almost all of that is coming from highrise resi so were encouraged about what we see going on out there and were encouraged about where lw is but we dont see any anomaly that we think would shift the trend from what weve seen in lw for the second quarter dennis p mcgill  zelman  associates thank you operator our next question comes from trey grooms from stephens please go ahead trey h grooms  stephens inc hey good morning james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer hey trey good morning trey h grooms  stephens inc jim i think on the last call you mentioned and you were talking about kind of the timing of the pricing around wallboard and i think that you said that the current pricing put in place in january this year is good through october which was a change is that still the expectation there on kind of your thoughts around the timing and any kind of thoughts you can give us behind that change would be great james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer yes trey thats exactly what were talking about we did move our price for this year our  wallboard price its not to exceed is effective through october  so the end of october and as we get – so to answer your question we have not changed our philosophy on that as we get closer were going to look at demand and inflation and everything we typically have done for actually the last five years to determine whether or not to exceed price will be for november  so those are the factors that influence our pricing decision so were still on that course trey h grooms  stephens inc okay and just kind of the thoughts behind that change from going from october to i guess november  – excuse me january to november james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer one of the big changes is the prebuys caused a lot of angst with our customers and in our conversations with our customers we floated the idea of moving the price into an area where its the busier time in the season and it would minimize if not eliminate some of the prebuys that our customers really either participated in or it had a negative impact on their business so that was the main reason of our discussion with our customers on prebuy trey h grooms  stephens inc i see makes sense thanks a lot jim good luck james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer okay thank you trey operator thank you our next question comes from kathryn thompson from thompson research group please go ahead kathryn ingram thompson  thompson research group llc hi thanks for taking my questions today pulling the string a little bit more on the nonres cycle for your us interiors business the ceilings business what were volumes contribution to the top line in the quarter and then shifting a little bit to look at your lw division could you give some clarity for what were sales volumes for steel studs specifically thank you james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer the tile volume kathryn could you repeat the question on the tile volume i wasnt – your connection wasnt really good sorry kathryn ingram thompson  thompson research group llc yeah sorry about that what were volumes for your ceiling tiles for your us interiors business in the quarter and then similarly for your lw division are you able to break out what your steel studs sales volumes were in that division or at least what your overall revenue growth was for steel studs and for lw james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer okay on the ceiling tile for the quarter we were up over the second quarter of last year volumes were up if you take out the second quarter of  it was the strongest quarter weve had since the third quarter of  so it was a – from a ceiling tile we dont break that out kathryn the number but the volume was up on steel studs for lw we do not break that out we dont disclose that but the volume was up with steel studs at lw in fact if you look at complementary products i talked about the seven core products most of those products are trending the right way and steel studs and i think youre heading in the direction on nonresi steel studs are a leading indicator of whats happening with nonres or the multifamily high rise and we really watch that steel stud number but we dont break that out kathryn ingram thompson  thompson research group llc but you wouldnt – its our assumption that you wouldnt perform materially different than what industry checks that we may have james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer im not sure what your industry checks would say kathryn ingram thompson  thompson research group llc okay great were seeing mid to high single digit volumes but understand that you cant be specific about volumes thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from keith hughes from suntrust please go ahead keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you its good to hear your ceilings volumes up to the last question sales in total were really only up like  million and grid and tile volume has showed its not a contributor to operating profits can you help me kind of reconcile maybe give us a feel of how much the ceiling tiles were up matthew f hilzinger  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah as jim said we dont give specific – this is matt hilzinger so we dont give specific information on ceiling tiles but they were up and grid was down a little bit thats how i would think about it so i think part of this is weve seen – jim talked a little bit about the repair and remodel side doing pretty well so we dont give specifics on that but i think if you stand back we feel very good about how the ceilings business performed in the second quarter volumes were up on tiles grid was down a little bit we did get a little bit of price improvement but weve also been able to see – and this is a continued theme that weve had in the business is a mix shift to the higher end tiles and i think were seeing more and more of that with lead certification points and noise reduction requirements in commercial buildings were continuing to see that mix move to the higherend products so overall we feel very good about where the ceilings business is keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer just to follow up on matts on the highend premium if you look at our overall ceiling tile volume that – those high end premium products continue to grow as a percentage of sales and theyre now over a third of our tile volume which is these highend tiles that matts indicating so were seeing a growing trend and when youre getting to a product thats onethird of your line thats a really positive impact for the business keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mark weintraub from buckingham research please go ahead mark a weintraub  the buckingham research group inc thank you one thing thats been obviously happening is multifamily has been stronger than singlefamily and recent indications are that that might continue im curious as you look through your products how does that affect you and are there any competitive differences for instance in the gypsum business or maybe youre stronger in multifamily relative to competition than you would be in singlefamily or vice versa any color that these trends in the strengthen in multifamily might be having visàvis your performance thatd be helpful james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer mark im really glad you asked that question because that falls right into our wheelhouse multifamily when you think of multifamily now its not the apartment complex in the suburbs as i said earlier its the storey to storey highrise rental typically rental not a condo and i think condos sales just came out starting to show some life so these are highrise rental units that are really commercial products these are commercial distributors stocking them ie lw they have steel studs which we distribute you have to have highend products like usg ultralight because labor rates – in a multifamily construction commercial contractors are installing that so the labor rates for example in chicago can be anywhere between  an hour and  an hour new york city its  so our products with having ultralight being lighter and easier to install fall right into that wheelhouse on ceiling tiles ceiling tile doesnt have a big impact there because you dont have a lot of acoustical drop ceilings in rental units maybe in the lobby but this multifamily is really positive for lw supply because a competitive advantage is this there are very few competitors of distribution that can safely put products in highrise buildings where if youre doing a singlefamily home you may have  competitors or  competitors when youre doing a high rise you may have five competitors and so you really have to have a unique value proposition so this falls right into our strengths as i mentioned our new product with tremco which focuses on the exterior of a commercial multifamily or a commercial office building so that brings a bigger share of wallet for us our securock roof deck as i said earlier that would be on the roof so if you think about usg corporation were not only in the interior now were in the exterior of hat highrise and by the way we deliver the products that get it there safely mark a weintraub  the buckingham research group inc and are you able to track if youve been able to maintain this competitive edge or are you finding that other competitors seeing the trends are going after the more multiflash commercial opportunities more aggressively james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer mark we dont have a competitor that has the full value from manufacturing to the job site so if you think about the value proposition we have in – when we make the product we introduce new products weve introduced over  new products in the last year some of those we dont talk a lot about but our innovation is second to none we are the only manufacturer that also has distribution and i know theres been a lot of questions about lw but you can see the trends are getting better we arent there yet so yeah we track it a lot competition is very fierce out there theres a lot of different ways to get to these jobs but we feel from innovation all the way to invoice we put it in the job safely so i like to say we have a unique value proposition that our investors like mark a weintraub  the buckingham research group inc terrific thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from jim barrett from cl king  associates please go ahead jim r barrett  cl king  associates inc hi good morning everyone james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jim jim r barrett  cl king  associates inc hi jim one of your initial initiatives as the ceo was to go into the boral joint venture that seems to be working out very very well can you tell us whether in the event down the road in the future boral was to exit – wish to exit their half of the joint venture where the usg has the right of first refusal and could you tell us if thats true broadly what the terms might be james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer yes thats true and id love to have that opportunity all right jim r barrett  cl king  associates inc is there a set formula james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer no there is not jim r barrett  cl king  associates inc okay thank you very much james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer and jim we appreciate your support over the years jim r barrett  cl king  associates inc okay thank you ryan flanagan  senior directorinvestor relations we have time for one other question operator thank you our last question comes from james armstrong from vertical research please go ahead james h armstrong  vertical research partners llc good morning thanks for taking my question my question is on the wallboard you talked more about the specialty products opening how much of the portfolio in wallboard is now from those specialty products and could you talk a little bit about margin and growth prospects in the specialty business james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer if you look at ultralight and thats a – we wouldnt view that as a specialty product but thats a new product for halfinch it is now almost twothirds of the volume the customers view the value proposition of ultralight so we do get a price premium on that so the margin is better securock is continuing to grow margins are very strong but whats great about securock is the growth the growth is x of what youre seeing in regular wallboard growth and thats why its really important for us to put products in the market as matt said that are green and that will continue to add to the profitability but we dont break that out were going to continue to break out surfaces and substrates as a whole but your are getting growth at higher margin similar what youre seeing on the ceilings side with the high end premium product so thats why its still important we have the innovation to come out with these higher performance products that have higher growth but more importantly have higher margins james h armstrong  vertical research partners llc thank you very much operator thank you james s metcalf  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you i really appreciate all the questions and as you can probably hear from matt and myself were really pleased with the quarter but more importantly were very excited about the rest of the year and the future as you said we saw that in the second quarter we expanded margins in all of our businesses we introduced some new products that help our customers grow and the usg boral continues to help us win in a growth area in asia and australasia but i want to let everyone know we arent content just to ride the wave of demand getting better and as weve said over the years we want to continue to create our own recovery which is – and we talked a little bit about it today is focused on cost reductions and were doing that through lean six sigma and advanced manufacturing with product innovation were going to continue to deliver product extensions i said we introduced  new products to  new products but we also have some big ideas that we have in the pipeline that we hope to share with you soon but most importantly having our customers top of mind every single day were very focused on customer satisfaction and really delighting our customers so were going to continue to strengthen diversify and differentiate and we really appreciate your interest in usg today and well talk to you next quarter thank you very much ryan flanagan  senior directorinvestor relations thanks jim a taped replay of this call will be available until thursday august  information is available on usgcom this
