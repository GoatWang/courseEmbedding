article computingtabulatingrecording company year gross income in m employees               holleriths plant in  the roots of ibm date back to the s since the s or earlier ibm has described its formation as a merger of three companies the tabulating machine company with origins in washington dc founded in  the international time recording company founded  in endicott and the computing scale company founded  in dayton ohio usa however the  stock prospectus states that four companies were consolidated the three described by ibm and the bundy manufacturing company founded in  further there was no merger no consolidation the new company named the computingtabulatingrecording companyctr was incorporated on june   in the state of new york usa ctr was a holding company the now five companies were an amalgamation the individual companies continued to operate using their established names until the holding company was eliminated in  the amalgamation was engineered by noted financier charles flint flint remained a member of the board of ctr until his retirement in  the companies that were amalgamated to form ctr manufactured a wide range of products including employee timekeeping systems weighing scales automatic meat slicers coffee grinders and punched card equipment the product lines were very different flint stated that the allied consolidation  instead of being dependent for earnings upon a single industry would own three separate and distinct lines of business so that in normal times the interest and sinking funds on its bonds could be earned by any one of these independent lines while in abnormal times the consolidation would have three chances instead of one to meet its obligations and pay dividends the five amalgamated companies had  employees and offices and plants in endicott and binghamton new york dayton ohio detroit michigan washington dc and toronto ontario of the companies amalgamated to form ctr the most technologically significant was the tabulating machine company founded by herman hollerith and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment holleriths series of patents on tabulating machine technology first applied for in  drew on his work at the us census bureau from – hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the  census his development of punched cards in  set the industry standard for the next  years of tabulating and computing data input in  the tabulating machine company leased some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day – the  us census after winning the government contract and completing the project hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in noncensus years he returned to targeting private businesses in the united states and abroad attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching tabulating and sorting machines in  hollerith now  and in failing health sold the business to flint for  million of which hollerith got  million who then founded ctr when the diversified businesses of ctr proved difficult to manage flint turned for help to the former no  executive at the national cash register company ncr thomas j watson sr watson became general manager of ctr in  and president in  by drawing upon his managerial experience at ncr watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics generous sales incentives a focus on customer service an insistence on wellgroomed darksuited salesmen and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker as the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company watson focused their attention on providing largescale tabulating solutions for businesses leaving the market for small office products to others he also stressed the importance of the customer a lasting ibm tenet the strategy proved successful as during watsons first four years revenues doubled to  million and company operations expanded to europe south america asia and australia at the helm during this period watson played a central role in establishing what would become the ibm organization and culture he launched a number of initiatives that demonstrated an unwavering faith in his workers he hired the companys first disabled worker in  he formed the companys first employee education department in  and in  he introduced his favorite slogan think which quickly became the corporate mantra watson boosted company spirit by encouraging any employee with a complaint to approach him or any other company executive – his famed open door policy he also sponsored employee sports teams family outings and a company band believing that employees were most productive when they were supported by healthy and supportive families and communities these initiatives – each deeply rooted in watsons personal values system – became core aspects of ibm culture for the remainder of the century watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the ctr and chose to replace it with the more expansive title international business machines first as a name for a  canadian subsidiary then as a line in advertisements for example the mcclures magazine v may  has a full page ad with at the bottom international

soon introduce a  column card – the great depressionedit year gross income in m employees       the great depression of the s presented an unprecedented economic challenge and watson met the challenge head on continuing to invest in people manufacturing and technological innovation despite the difficult economic times rather than reduce staff he hired additional employees in support of president franklin roosevelts national recovery administration plan – not just salesmen which he joked that he had a lifelong weakness for but engineers too watson not only kept his workforce employed he increased their benefits ibm was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance  survivor benefits  and paid vacations  he upped his ante on his workforce by opening the ibm schoolhouse in endicott to provide education and training for ibm employees and he greatly increased ibms research capabilities by building a modern research laboratory on the endicott manufacturing site with all this internal investment watson was in essence gambling on the future it was ibms first ‘bet the company’ gamble but the risk paid off handsomely watsons factories running full tilt for six years with no market to sell to created a huge inventory of unused tabulating equipment straining ibms resources to reduce the cash drain the struggling dayton scale division the food services equipment business was sold in  to hobart manufacturing for stock when the social security act of  – labeled as the biggest accounting operation of all time – came up for bid ibm was the only bidder that could quickly provide the necessary equipment watsons gamble brought the company a landmark government contract to maintain employment records for  million people ibms successful performance on the contract soon led to other government orders and by the end of the decade ibm had not only safely negotiated the depression but risen to the forefront of the industry watsons depressionera decision to invest heavily in technical development and sales capabilities education to expand the breadth of those capabilities and his commitment to the data processing product line laid the foundation for  years of ibm growth and successes his avowed focus on international expansion proved an equally key component of the companys th century growth and success watson having witnessed the havoc the first world war wrought on society and business envisioned commerce as an obstacle to war he saw business interests and peace as being mutually compatible in fact he felt so strongly about the connection between the two that he had his slogan world peace through world trade carved into the exterior of ibms new world headquarters  in new york city the slogan became an ibm business mantra and watson campaigned tirelessly for the concept with global business and government leaders he served as an informal unofficial government host for world leaders when they visited new york and received numerous awards

in the s with the death of founding father thomas j watson sr on june   at age  ibm experienced its first leadership change in more than four decades the mantle of chief executive fell to his eldest son thomas j watson jr ibms president since  the new chief executive faced a daunting task the company was in the midst of a period of rapid technological change with nascent computer technologies – electronic computers magnetic tape storage disk drives programming – creating new competitors and market uncertainties internally the company was growing by leaps and bounds creating organizational pressures and significant management challenges lacking the force of personality that watson sr had long used to bind ibm together watson jr and his senior executives privately wondered if the new generation of leadership was up to challenge of managing a company through this tumultuous period we are wrote one longtime ibm executive in  in grave danger of losing our eternal values that are as valid in electronic days as in mechanical counter days watson jr responded by drastically restructuring the organization mere months after his father died creating a modern management structure that enabled him to more effectively oversee the fast moving company he codified well known but unwritten ibm practices and philosophy into formal corporate policies and programs – such as ibms three basic beliefs and open door and speak up perhaps the most significant of which was his shepherding of the companys first equal opportunity policy letter into existence in  one year before the us supreme

computer footprint ever and continued in service until  more valuable to ibm in the long run than the profits from governmental projects however was the access to cuttingedge research into digital computers being done under military auspices ibm neglected however to gain an even more dominant role in the nascent industry by allowing the rand corporation to take over the job of programming the new computers because according to one project participant robert p crago we couldnt imagine where we could absorb two thousand programmers at ibm when this job would be over some day which shows how well we were understanding the future at that time ibm would use its experience designing massive integrated realtime networks with sage to design its sabre airline reservation system which met with

sherman act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general purpose electronic digital computer system market specifically computers designed primarily for business the case dragged out for  years turning into a resourcesapping war of attrition in  the justice department finally concluded that the case was without merit and dropped it but having to operate under the pall of antitrust litigation significantly impacted ibms business decisions and operations during all of the s and a good portion of the s in  ibm unbundled software and services from hardware sales until this time customers did not pay for software or services separately from the very high price for leasing the hardware software was provided at no additional charge generally in source code form services systems engineering education and training system installation were provided free of charge at the discretion of the ibm branch office this practice existed throughout the industry quoting from the abstract to a widely read ieee paper on the topic “ many people believe that one pivotal event in the growth of the business software products market was ibms decision in  to price its software and services separately from its hardware ” at the time the unbundling of services was perhaps the most contentious point involving antitrust issues that had recently been widely debated in the press and the courts however ibms unbundling of software had longterm impact after the unbundling ibm software was divided into two main categories system control programming scp which remained free to customers and program products pp which were charged for this transformed the customers value proposition for computer solutions giving a significant monetary value to something that had hitherto essentially been free this helped enable the creation of a software industry similarly ibm services were divided into two categories general information which remained free and provided at the discretion of ibm

coincided with the beginning of a new era in computing – the age of personal computing the original ibm pc ca  the company hired don estridge at the ibm entry systems division in boca raton florida with a team known as project chess they built the ibm pc launched on august   ibm immediately became more of a presence in the consumer marketplace thanks to the memorable little tramp advertising campaign though not a spectacular machine by technological standards of the day the ibm pc brought together all of the most desirable features of a computer into one small machine it had  kilobytes of memory expandable to  kilobytes one or two floppy disks and an optional color monitor and it had the prestige of the ibm brand it was not cheap but with a base price of us it was affordable for businesses – and many businesses purchased pcs reassured by the ibm name they began buying microcomputers on their own budgets aimed at numerous applications that corporate computer departments did not and in many cases could not accommodate typically these purchases were not by corporate computer departments as the pc was not seen as a proper computer purchases were often instigated by middle managers and senior staff who saw the potential – once the revolutionary visicalc spreadsheet the killer app had been surpassed by a far more powerful and stable product lotus  boca corporate center  campus was originally one of ibms research labs where the ibm pc was created by  ibm was so dominant that competitors and analysts speculated that it would again be sued for antitrust gartner group estimated that of the  largest dataprocessing companies ibm had  of all revenue and  of profit its computer revenue was about nine times that of secondplace dec and larger than that of ibms six largest japanese competitors combined its profit margin of  was three times the  average for the other  companies some companies complained to congress adapso discussed the company with the justice department and european governments worried about ibms influence but feared affecting its more than  employees there at  facilities however the company soon lost its lead in both pc hardware and software thanks in part to its unprecedented for ibm decision to contract pc components to outside companies like microsoft and intel up to this point in its history ibm relied on a vertically integrated strategy building most key components of its systems itself including processors operating systems peripherals databases and the like in an attempt to accelerate the timetomarket for the pc ibm chose not to build a proprietary operating system and microprocessor instead it sourced these vital components from microsoft and intel respectively ironically in a decade which marked the end of ibms monopoly it was this fateful decision by ibm that passed the sources of its monopolistic power operating system and processor architecture to microsoft and intel paving the way for rise of pc compatibles and the creation of hundreds of billions of dollars of market value outside of ibm john akers became ibms ceo in  during the s ibms significant investment in building a world class

network nsfnet an important step in the creation of the internet but within five years the company backed away from this early lead in internet protocols and router technologies in order to support its existing sna cash cow thereby missing a boom market of the s still ibm investments and advances in microprocessors disk drives network technologies software applications and online commerce in the s set the stage for the emergence of the connected world in the s but by the end of the decade ibm was clearly in trouble it was a bloated organization of some  employees that was heavily invested in low margin transactional commodity businesses technologies ibm invented and or commercialized – dram hard disk drives the pc electric typewriters – were starting to erode the company had a massive international organization characterized by redundant processes and functions – its cost structure couldn’t compete with smaller less diversified competitors and then the backtoback revolutions – the pc and the client server – did the unthinkable they combined to dramatically undermine ibms core mainframe business the pc revolution placed computers directly in the hands of millions of people it was followed by the clientserver revolution which sought to link all of those pcs the clients with larger computers that labored in the background the servers that served data and applications to client machines both revolutions transformed the way customers viewed used and bought technology and both fundamentally rocked ibm businesses purchasing decisions were put in the hands of individuals and departments – not the places where ibm had longstanding customer relationships piecepart technologies took precedence over integrated solutions the focus was on the desktop and personal productivity not on business applications across the enterprise as a result earnings – which had been at or above us billion since the early s dropped by more than a third to us billion in  a brief spike in earnings in  proved illusory as corporate spending continued to shift from high profit margin mainframes to lower margin microprocessorbased systems in addition corporate downsizing was in full swing akers tried to stop the bleeding – desperate moves and radical changes were considered and implemented as ibm assessed the situation it was clear that competition and innovation in the computer industry was now taking place along segmented versus vertically integrated lines where leaders emerged in their respective domains examples included intel in microprocessors microsoft in desktop software novell in networking hp in printers seagate in disk drives and oracle corporation in database software ibms dominance in personal computers was challenged by the likes of compaq and later dell recognizing this trend management with the support of the board of directors began to implement a plan to split ibm into increasingly autonomous business units eg processors storage software services printers etc to compete more effectively with competitors that were more focused and nimble and had lower cost structures ibm also began shedding businesses that it felt were no longer core it sold its typewriter keyboard and printer business – the organization that created the popular selectric typewriter with its floating golf ball type element in the s – to the investment firm of clayton dubilier  rice inc and became an independent company lexmark inc these efforts failed to halt the slide a decade of steady acceptance and widening corporate growth of local area networking technology a trend headed by novell inc and other vendors and its logical counterpart the ensuing decline of mainframe sales brought about a wakeup call for ibm after two consecutive years

in april  ibm hired louis v gerstner jr as its new ceo for the first time since  ibm had recruited a leader from outside its ranks gerstner had been chairman and ceo of rjr nabisco for four years and had previously spent  years as a top executive at american express gerstner brought with him a customeroriented sensibility and the strategicthinking expertise that he had honed through years as a management consultant at mckinsey  co recognizing that his first priority was to stabilize the company he adopted a triage mindset and took quick dramatic action his early decisions included recommitting to the mainframe selling the federal systems division to loral in order to replenish the companys cash coffers continuing to shrink the workforce reaching a low of  employees in  and driving significant cost reductions within the company most importantly gerstner decided to reverse the move to spin off ibm business units into separate companies he recognized that one of ibms enduring strengths was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers – someone who could represent more than piece parts or components splitting the company would have destroyed that unique ibm advantage these initial steps worked ibm was in the black by  turning a profit of  billion stabilization was not gerstners endgame – the restoration of ibms once great reputation was to do that he needed to devise a winning business strategy over the next decade gerstner crafted a business model that shed commodity businesses and focused on highmargin opportunities ibm divested itself of low margin industries dram ibm network personal printers and hard drives the company regained the business initiative by building upon the decision to keep the company whole – it unleashed a global services business that rapidly rose to become a leading technology integrator crucial to this success was the decision to become brand agnostic – ibm integrated whatever technologies the client required even if they were from an ibm competitor ibm augmented this services business with the  acquisition of the consultancy division of pricewaterhousecoopers for  billion us another high margin opportunity ibm invested heavily in was software a strategic move that proved equally visionary starting in  with its acquisition of lotus development corp ibm built up its software portfolio from one brand db to five db lotus websphere tivoli and rational content to leave the consumer applications business to other firms ibms software strategy focused on middleware – the vital software that connects operating systems to applications the middleware business played to ibms strengths and its higher margins improved the companys bottom line significantly as the century came to an end not all software that ibm developed was successful while os was arguably technically superior to microsoft windows  os sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals os failed to develop much penetration in the consumer and standalone desktop pc segments there were reports that it could not be installed properly on ibms own aptiva series of home pcs microsoft made an offer in  where if ibm ended development of os completely then it would receive the same terms as compaq for a license of windows  ibm refused and instead went with an ibm first strategy of promoting os warp and disparaging windows as ibm aimed to drive sales of its own software and hardware by  windows  negotiations between ibm and microsoft which were difficult stalled when ibm purchased lotus development whose lotus smartsuite would have directly competed with microsoft office as a result ibm received their license later than their competitors which hurt sales of ibm pcs ibm officials later conceded that os would not have been a viable operating system to keep them in the pc business while ibm hardware and technologies were relatively deemphasized in gerstners threelegged business model they were not relegated to secondary status the company brought its worldclass research organization to bear more closely on its existing product lines and development processes while internet applications and deep computing overtook client servers as key business technology priorities mainframes returned to relevance ibm reinvigorated their mainframe line with cmos technologies which made them among the most powerful and cost efficient in the marketplace investments in microelectronics research and manufacturing made ibm a world leader in specialized high margin chip production – it developed  mm wafer processes in  and  mm wafers within the decade ibmdesigned chips are currently used in playstation  xbox  and wii game consoles ibm also regained the lead in supercomputing with highend machines based upon scalable parallel processor technology equally significant in ibms revival was its successful reentry into the popular mindset part of this revival was based on ibm technology on october   at the comdex computer expo ibm announced the first thinkpad laptop computer the c the thinkpad a premium machine which then cost us included a  mhz intel sl processor a inch active matrix display removable  mb hard drive  mb ram expandable to  mb and a trackpoint ii pointing device the striking black design by noted designer richard sapper made the thinkpad an immediate hit with the digerati and the cool factor of the thinkpad brought back some of the cachet to the ibm brand that was lost in the pc wars of the s instrumental to this popular resurgence was the  chess match between ibms chessplaying computer system deep blue and reigning world chess champion garry kasparov deep blues victory was a historic first for a computer over a reigning world champion also helping the company reclaim its position as a technology leader was its annual domination of supercomputer rankings and patent leadership statistics ironically a serendipitous contributor in reviving the companys reputation was the dotcom bubble collapse in  where many of the edgy technology high flyers of the s failed to survive the downturn these collapses discredited some of the more fashionable internetdriven business models that stodgy ibm was previously compared against another part of the successful reentry into the popular mindset was the companys revival of the ibm brand the companys marketing during the economic downturn was chaotic presenting many different sometimes discordant voices in the marketplace this brand chaos was attributable in part to the company having  different advertising agencies in its employ in  ibm eliminated this chaos by consolidating its advertising in one agency the result was a coherent consistent message to the marketplace as ibm recovered its financial footing and its industry leadership position the company remained aggressive in preaching to the industry that it was not the old ibm that it had learned from its near death experiences and that it had been fundamentally changed by them it sought to redefine the internet age in ways that played to traditional ibm strengths couching the discussion in businesscentric manners with initiatives like ecommerce and on demand and it supported open source initiatives forming collaborative ventures with partners and competitors alike change was manifested in ibm in other ways as well the company revamped its varied philanthropic practices to bring a sharp focus on improving k education it ended its year technology partnership with the international olympic committee after a successful engagement at the  olympic games in sydney australia on the human resources front ibms adoption and integration of diversity principles and practices was cutting edge it added

supercomputer that beat garry kasparov in chess in   flexible transistors ibm created flexible transistors combining organic and inorganic materials as a medium for semiconductors this technology enables things like an electronic newspaper so lightweight and inexpensive that leaving one behind on the airplane or in a hotel lobby is no big deal by eliminating the limitations of etching computer circuits in silicon flexible transistors make it possible to create a new generation of inexpensive computer displays that can be embedded into curved plastic or other materials  sydney olympics after a successful engagement at the  olympic games in sydney ibm ends its year technology partnership with the international olympic committee  holocaust controversy a controversial book ibm and the holocaust the strategic alliance between nazi germany and americas most powerful corporation by edwin black accuses ibm of having knowingly assisted nazi authorities in the perpetuation of the holocaust through the provision of tabulating products and services several lawsuits are filed against ibm by holocaust victims seeking restitution for their suffering and losses all lawsuits related to this issue were eventually dropped without recovery  carbon nanotube transistors ibm researchers build the worlds first transistors out of carbon nanotubes – tiny cylinders of carbon atoms that are  times smaller than siliconbased transistors and  times stronger than steel the breakthrough is an important step in finding materials that can be used to build computer chips when siliconbased chips can’t be made any smaller  low power initiative ibm launches its lowpower initiative to improve the energy efficiency of it and accelerates the development of ultralow power components and powerefficient servers storage systems personal computers and thinkpad notebook computers  greater density  chip speeds ibm is first to massproduce computer hard disk drives using a revolutionary new type of magnetic coating – pixie dust – that eventually quadruples data density of current hard disk drive products ibm also unveils strained silicon a breakthrough that alters silicon to boost chip

magnetic tape data storageibm formats evolution of ibms operating systemsedit main article history of ibm mainframe operating systems ibm operating systems have paralleled hardware development on early systems operating systems represented a relatively modest level of investment and were essentially viewed as an adjunct to the hardware by the time of the system however operating systems had assumed a much larger role in terms of cost complexity importance and risk mainframe operating systems include os family including os osmft osmvt osvs osvs mvs os zos dos family including dos dosvs dosvse zvse vm family including cpcms see history of cpcms vm vmxa vmesa zvm special purpose systems including tpf ztpf other platforms with important operating systems include aix family including aix linux family including linux for pseries os family including os ibm ios and ibm i highlevel languagesedit early ibm computer systems like those from many other vendors were programmed using assembly language computer science efforts through the s and early s led to the development of many new highlevel languages hll for programming ibm played a complicated role in this process hardware vendors were naturally concerned about the implications of portable languages that would allow customers to pick and choose among vendors without compatibility problems ibm in particular helped create barriers that tended to lock customers into a single platform ibm had a significant role in the following major computer languages fortran – for years the dominant language for mathematics and scientific programming pli – an attempt to create a be all and end all language cobol – eventually the ubiquitous standard language for business applications apl – an early interactive language with a mathematical notation pls – an internal systems programming language proprietary to ibm rpg – an acronym for report program generator developed on the ibm  to produce reports from data files general systems division enhanced the language to hll status on its midrange systems to rival with cobol sql – a relational query language developed for ibms system r now the standard rdbms query language rexx – a macro and scripting language based on pli syntax originally developed for conversational monitor system cms and authored by ibm fellow mike cowlishaw ibm and aixunixlinuxscoedit ibm developed a schizophrenic relationship with the unix and linux worlds the importance of ibms large computer business placed strange pressures on all of ibms attempts to develop other lines of business all ibm projects faced the risk of being seen as competing against company priorities this was because if a customer decided to build an application on an rs platform this also meant that a decision had been made against a mainframe platform so despite having some excellent technology ibm often placed itself in a compromised position a case in point is ibms gfis products for infrastructure management and gis applications despite long having a dominant position in such industries as electric gas and water utilities ibm stumbled badly in the s trying to build workstationbased solutions to replace its old mainframebased products customers were forced to move on to new technologies from other vendors many felt betrayed by ibm ibm embraced open source technologies in the s it later became embroiled in a complex litigation with sco group over intellectual property rights related to the unix and linux platforms bicarsa billing inventory control accounts receivable  sales analysisedit  saw the announcement of the system the replacement for the system and in  ibm announced the as intended to represent a point of convergence for both system customers and system customers the s had seen ibm develop a range of billing inventory control accounts receivable  sales analysis bicarsa  applications for specific industries construction cmas distribution dmas and manufacturing mmas all written in the rpg ii language by the end of the s ibm had almost completely withdrawn from the bicarsa applications marketplace because of developments in the antitrust cases against ibm brought by the us government and european union ibm sales representatives were now able to work openly with application software houses as partners for a period in the early s a rule of three operated which obliged ibm sales representatives if they were to propose a thirdparty application to a customer to also list at least two other thirdparty vendors in the ibm proposal this caused some amusement to the customer who would typically have engaged in intense negotiations with one of the third parties and probably not have heard of the other two vendors noncomputer lines of businessedit ibm has largely been known for its overtaking univacs early s public fame then leading in the computer industry for much of the latter part of the century however it has also had roles some significant in other industries

part due to its strong professional services activities ibms advantage in building software for its own computers eventually was seen as monopolistic leading to antitrust proceedings as a result a complex artificial armslength relationship was created separating ibms computer business from its service organizations this situation persisted for decades an example was ibm global services a huge
