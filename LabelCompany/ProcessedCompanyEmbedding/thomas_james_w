repertoire generates an enormous number of immune receptors that become immune effectors as antibodies because many of the immune receptors produced during b cell development also react with self antigens ie are autoreactive mechanisms are necessary to prevent the emergence of potentially toxic b cell clones and antibodies the mechanisms that maintain this autoreactivity in check are broadly termed â€œimmune toleranceâ€ every immune response must first negotiate checkpoints of immune tolerance before effective host defense can be generated in autoimmune diseases these checkpoints fail and autoagressive clones emerge among these loss of b cell tolerance as manifest by antiinsulin antibodies is a harbinger of autoimmune beta cell destruction in the pancreas that causes type  insulin dependent diabetes to study this event at the cellular and molecular level our laboratory has generated mice that harbor insulin autoantibodies as b cell receptor transgenes td prone nod mice that harbor an ig heavy chain transgene permit us to investigate a population of insulin binding b cells in the repertoire we find that these insulin specific b cells promote td in the nod mouse model in addition we have discovered that some of these b cells invade islets and express receptors that may bind antigens other than insulin capturing the antigen receptors on these b cells provides a means to discover new beta cell autoantigens that are targets in td further a new line of transgenic mice is being generated in which the antiinsulin v regions are targeted to the ig locus studies in these will identify for the first time when and where immune tolerance is lost allowing antiinsulin b cells to undergo class switch recombination and differentiation into antibody producing cells studies in the laboratory investigate how the action of helper and regulatory t cells alter this critical immune response research keywords our laboratory investigates the mechanisms that regulate immune tolerance and why they fail in autoimmune disorders such at type  diabetes publications wan x thomas jw unanue er classswitched antiinsulin antibodies originate from unconventional antigen
