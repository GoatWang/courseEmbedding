printing stereolithography d printing the additivemanufacturing technology charles w hull developed has made rapid prototyping possible and opened up new applications across countless industries the technology could one day become one of the biggest advances in manufacturing since the industrial revolution in the early s charles w hull set out to improve the tedious process of creating small plastic parts for prototyping involved in testing new product designs only one year after he had developed the first model of his d printer hull applied for a patent for his invention a machine that could perform in a matter of minutes what would normally take several weeks of moulding and casting hull who was then working at a company that used uv light to apply thin sheets of plastic veneers onto table tops furniture and paper products realised that if he was able to overlay thousands of these laminate layers on top of each other and etch their shape using uv light he could form threedimensional objects in nearly any conceivable form today stereolithography has become the state of the art for prototyping new models – and an industry in itself societal benefit printers designed by hull’s company d systems have made their way into myriad industrial and commercial uses medicaltechnology companies rely on them to create models of patients’ jaws and facial structures an automotive safety company uses the technology to design “intelligent” crashtest dummies a watchmaker uses d systems’ printers to evaluate designs before final production – and the list goes on from aeroplane wings and architectural models to toys and electric bicycles countless products and prototypes come to life faster and cheaper than ever before economic benefit d systems founded in  became a leader in the d printing industry posting sales of about us  million in  it is now listed on the nasdaq stock exchange and employs more than  people the market for d printers and d printing services was valued at us  billion in  a  increase from  according to current estimates the annual market value will increase to us  billion by  technavio forecasts the global rapidprototyping systems market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of  from  until  originally used for the rapid production of prototypes for form and fit testing d printing is now transitioning towards the manufacture of final products – and the d printing landscape keeps evolving as new uses for the technology are being discovered every day charles w hull charles w hull charles w hull charles w hull charles w hull charles w hull how it works d systems’ software “slices” a threedimensional blueprint model into thousands of digital crosssections each slice corresponds to a layer of the model that will be fabricated and can be as thin as  mm in the highestresolution versions this information is sent to a stereolithograph apparatus which contains a vat filled with uvsensitive liquid photopolymer resin a movable uv laser shines a highintensity beam of light onto the vat and traces the complete shape of the crosssection of the object after the laser has finished its outline the first layer of polymer hardens depending on the size of the object to be produced the process is then repeated several thousands of times layer upon layer until it is completed the inventor in  charles w hull probably didn’t imagine that his idea to speed up prototyping would set off an avalanche that is today  years later still in motion as many as  us  european and  japanese patents have since joined his first and despite his  years hull thinks that his field of work still is too interesting to retire with his recent induction into the national inventors hall of fame in the us hull working actively as executive vice president and chief technology officer of d systems has joined the ranks of figures such as henry ford and steve jobs in other words people who have made a lasting impact on humanity did you know one of the first manufacturing sectors to enjoy the benefits of hull’s innovation was the automotive industry ford motor company conducted a study in the mids that showed hull’s technology could save considerable time and money today the technology has become a mainstay in the automotive sector used to develop everything from highperformance formula  racing engines to forming simple levers and buttons the technology has since taken many more industries by storm quick navigationhomepage alt  skip navigation alt  sitemap alt  accessibility information alt    patent

coined the term “stereolithography” in his us patent  entitled “apparatus for production of threedimensional objects by stereolithography” issued on march   he defined stereolithography as a method and apparatus for making solid objects by successively “printing” thin layers of the ultraviolet curable material one on top of the other in hull’s patent a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light is focused onto the surface of a vat filled with liquid photopolymer the light beam moving under computer control draws each layer of the object onto the surface of the liquid wherever the beam strikes

sharing options share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger close this article is  years old shane hickey in berlin sunday  june   edt first published on sunday  june   edt although measured and deliberate in his responses there is one moment when the softly spoken chuck hull – known as the father of d printing – tells of his surprise about what exactly his creation was capable of achieving in  surgeons at the wilford hall medical centre in texas working to separate a pair of conjoined twins thought that only one would be able to walk after the operation after a model of the girls bone structure was generated using d printing however they found a shared upper leg bone to be bigger than expected and split it successfully resulting in both twins being able to walk hull said this is extremely difficult for surgeons to figure out how they are going to separate the two twins so that you will have two separately living people when some of those surgeries were first done using the help of our technology it was really touching for me now  and still working as chief technology officer of d systems the company he cofounded hull is enjoying some minor celebrity  years after he first printed a small black eyewash cup using a new method of manufacturing called stereolithography now known as d printing at the time he was working for a company that used uv light to put thin layers of plastic veneers on tabletops and furniture like others within the industry he was frustrated that the production of small plastic parts for prototyping new product designs could take up to two months he had an idea that if he could place thousands of thin layers of plastic on top of each other and then etch their shape using light he would be able to form three dimensional objects after a year of tinkering with ideas in a backroom lab after hours he developed a system where light was shone into a vat of photopolymer – a material which changes from liquid to plasticlike solid when light shines on it – and traces the shape of one level of the object subsequent layers are then printed until it is complete after patenting the invention in  he set up d systems in order to commercialise the new method of production and went on the road to secure both funding – eventually getting m £m from a canadian investor – and customers using videotapes to show the equipment the first commercial product came out in  and proved a hit among car manufacturers in the aerospace sector and for companies designing medical equipment soon general motors and mercedesbenz were using d systems technology – the company sold printers materials and software – to build prototypes but it was developments in medicine that stunned him such as when models in advance of surgery could be created that was just startling to me that someone used the technology like that when hull originally came up with his invention he told his wife that it would take between  and  years before the technology would find its way into the home that prediction proved correct as the realistic prospect of widespread commercial d printers has only emerged in recent years the possibilities appear endless – from homeprinted food and pharmaceuticals to suggestions that pictures of ceramics will be able to be taken in shops and then recreated using plans downloaded from the internet hull an unassuming man who has  patents to his name in the us and  in europe says he is humbled by the possibilities but stops short of predicting what his technology could eventually deliver although he is confident printers could soon be in every home its nice to get some recognition it was a lot of hard work but other than that i just keep working he said last week in berlin where he received a european inventor award controversy has arisen with the possibility that guns will be able to be produced using d printing again using blueprints downloaded from the internet a group called defense distributed last year successfully tested a d printed gun in texas hull said my first thought is that people messing with that – i hope they dont hurt themselves building and testing guns of that nature could be dangerous i think the people doing that were trying to make a point i dont know that people are going to be printing guns around the world but in any case our company we are not the government or the police agencies it is more their business and all technology the governments and the police have to be aware of it is not just d printing after finding that retirement was not for him hull returned to the company he cofounded and is now vicepresident as well as chief technology officer and holds shares worth m £m last year d systems brought in revenues of more than m £m and has three bases in the uk in hemel hempstead high wycombe and clevedon new systems of d printing have emerged over the years and various other firms have been added to the d systems stable last week the company launched the ekocycle cube printer in a collaboration with the singer william named chief creative officer in january which is touted as being for everyday use and priced at  £ stepping down is not an option at the moment for hull who declares the products of d printing now including ranges of jewellery as all his children future projects include working with google on the companys next generation phone we always say which room is it going to be in i am not much of a futurist it is really difficult for me to project i sit there and work on the projects i have and i dont have a lot of say on where this is going what can be printed on a small plot in the north of amsterdam architects are building what they hope will be the first dprinted house they are laying blocks that have

electronics show in las vegas showcased printers that could produce foods such as ravioli and chocolate printed patterns while harvard researchers have recently unveiled what they say is the first d printed battery which can be constructed in minutes new in tech this week • will your next phone be d amazons new fire phone uses a system of four cameras to constantly track its users face and makes objects appear d using dynamic perspective – shifting the image around as the user tilts their head users can nod and use other gestures to navigate the phone too which uses amazons own version of the android software but a camera on the back that can instantly recognise objects books art and goods is the killer feature for the online superstore point the phone at a book snap a picture and buy it
