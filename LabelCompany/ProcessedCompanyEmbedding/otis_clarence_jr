by business day ensemble acting in business june   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story this interview of clarence otis jr ceo of darden restaurants was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq what’s the most important leadership lesson you’ve learneda it’s one that i learned early on and it kept getting reinforced and cemented over time with a number of different leaders it’s this notion that leaders really think about others first they think about the people who are on the team trying to help them get the job done they think about the people who they’re trying to do a job for your thoughts are always there first and you think about what’s the appropriate response for whatever that audience is and you think last about “what does this mean for me”the guy who reinforced that most would have been my predecessor here at darden joe lee i was cfo at the time but on sept   after it became clear what had happened we had an allemployee meeting and joe started to talk one of the first things he said was “we are trying to understand where all our people are who are traveling”the second thing he said was “we’ve got a lot of muslim teammates managers in our restaurants employees in our restaurants who are going to be under a lot of stress during this period and so we need to make sure we’re attentive to that” and that was pretty powerful of all the things you could focus on that morning he thought about the people who were on the road and then our muslim colleagues advertisement continue reading the main story q how would you say your leadership style has changed over timea it’s less and less about getting the work done and more and more about building the team — getting the right people in place who have the talent and capability to get the work done and letting them do it continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q anything in your background that looking back prepared you for the art of building a teama the thing that prepared me the most — where the team was front and center — was theater which i did a lot of growing up in high school during college law school and even for a couple of years after law school i would say that probably is the starkest lesson in how reliant you are on others because you’re there in front of an audience it’s all live and everybody’s got to know their lines and know their cues and know their movement and so you’re totally dependent on people doing thatyou could have your piece down but if one person on the team doesn’t you’re in trouble and it’s embarrassing because people aren’t used to seeing errors in theater theater is seamless every nightq how do you hire people a the most important thing to me is you want to see someone who has passion who really gets excited about the world around them and has drive i like people who are energized by what they’re working on i’m comfortable with people who are passionate comfortable with people who are ambitious for the organizations they work in ambitious for the function that they are building a career in and want to make a contributionbeing comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty is a trait i look for because those folks are pretty comfortable with diversity and not knowing how people who have differences might react in a situation doesn’t unmoor them they’re comfortable with it and may even like that those kinds of folks also when they’re faced with ambiguity and uncertainty they’ve got their wits about them so they’re looking as much for the opportunity that’s inherent in that as they are for the riskq how do you find out if somebody is like thata you ask them about the various experiences they have had and you try to probe “where were those circumstances where there wasn’t good direction when it wasn’t clear how things would break” how do they respond to those questions what’s the narrative around how they thought and behaved in those environmentsq are there things that as a leader or manager you’ve learned to do less of over timea i’d say probably less wordsmithing less massaging of the work product more thinking more reflecting and that’s hard because i like to wordsmith with my background in theater and the law i like that kind of stuff and i work on things past the point where it makes any differenceq what are you wordsmithinga i’ll wordsmith press releases wordsmith analyst reports reports to the board you can wordsmith internal employee memos and speeches there are all kinds of things photo clarence otis jr ceo of darden restaurants which include red lobster olive garden and capital grille says his work in theater taught a lesson on how reliant you are on others credit gary bogdon for the new york times q any thoughts on how language is used in the business worlda i think writing in the business world is more functional than elegant i felt that way making the transition from law to business lawyers write much better they spend a lot more time on it in the business world it’s less about how well you say it and more about how efficiently you say it advertisement continue reading the main story i do think language is important in leadership and it’s critically important in oral communication it’s worth thinking about exactly how you’re going to say something it’s important for focusing people it’s important for inspiring them it’s important for directing them the more senior you are the more important it is because your voice is amplified newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a

preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime i did think it was an interesting debate during the presidential democratic primary when they talked about barack obama and how being able to give a good speech was one thing but getting things done was another i think to get a lot of things done you have to be able to give a good speech so i thought that was a specious argumentq are there areas you’re trying to improve as a leadera as i said i really value the passion as a senior leader sometimes you’ve got to harness the passion so you’ve got to give other people the chance to speak voice a point of view some people are passionate but it manifests itself in a different way and so they’re more reflective in conversation and so you’ve got to leave some space for them to fillq do you find looking back over the course of your career there was a certain insight you had that put you on a different trajectorya i went to williams college i went to stanford law school and i loved them both i was a strong student at williams which i needed to be to get into a school like stanford i got to stanford and it was clear that the level of brain power among my student peers had just stepped up several levels it was clear to me pretty quickly that no matter how hard i worked i was not going to do better than a lot of my peers because things came quicker to them than they did to me even though that was not true at williams it was true at stanford but that was fine and i was comfortable with thatwhat i discovered when i started practicing law was that even though others had more intellectual horsepower people still listened to me they cared about what i thought — my peers and the people i worked for and so that was probably the insight that told me at some point i could have a leadership position because people really seemed to care what i thought and they listened to meq was there a particularly good piece of advice somebody gave you about your careera one of the guys i worked for very early on said “as you think about career it’s not about planning it things are too dynamic there’s too much going on there are too many things that’ll pop up good and bad it’s not about planning and career planning it’s about preparation and building skills and if you do that then you’ll recover from the mishaps and you’ll be able to take advantage of the opportunities”q what has surprised you the most about the top joba i would say it’s how amplified everything that you say or do is that was the case at every senior job it’s even more true of this position and so you have to be very intentional about what you say and do if you’re not then something that was just thinking out loud some thought you had some “what if” becomes a directive even though  seconds later in your own mind you dismissed it advertisement continue reading the main story q let’s talk about time management how do you do it a i schedule and block the calendar to have downtime because i do think that in senior leadership positions one of your jobs is to reflect and you have to schedule time to do that i try to leave a few hours a week that are unscheduledq what would you like business schools to teach more of or less ofa i didn’t go to business school i went to law school but my sense is the one thing law school does that business schools could do more of is provide you with social context the broader context within which business operates there are businessandthelaw kinds of courses but sometimes they get pretty transactionali think it would be interesting for business school students to learn constitutional law and comparative law i think the dialogue between the business community and the civic community is hampered by that gap and it’s never been clearer in my mind than now when you’ve got a constitutional law professor as president there’s just a disconnect people don’t get the worldview that he’s coming from but i don’t think he gets the business side as much as he should either there is a framework he’s coming from and it’s as much a foundation to how this country works as the free enterprise system is you’ve got to reconcile the twoq what’s your version of a twominute commencement speecha i would tell them that they’re privileged given the status that they have the fact that they’ve been able to get a higher education and with privilege comes obligations i think one of the most important obligations is for them to provide leadership in whatever area they choose to dedicate their life toprovide leadership — that’s the price of the privilege they’ve been granted so it’s about more than them certainly there are things they want to accomplish but they’ve got to make sure that those things have some payoff for others continue reading the main story
