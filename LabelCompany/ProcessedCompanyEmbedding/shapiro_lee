glassdid you knowtypes of dentiststhe human mouth is a complex biological system and no two individuals have the same oral care needs here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral healthgeneral dentist these dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care if you need your teeth cleaned crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures book an appointment with a general dentist though not as common these dentists will also provide more specialized services including some forms of oral surgery  chief among them root canals and restorative care  fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutritionendodontist to become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school as a result these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work while a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week an endodontist may end up working on  or more in the same timespan your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments which is repeat root canal procedure their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment  especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformitiespediatric dentist proper oral care starts when youre young and thats why pediatric dentists are so important these dentists treat people under the age of  though there are exceptions based on a childs unique dental background pediatric dentists face unique challenges because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeththough cleanings are an integral part of their job pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead that means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite however they also help address more childspecific conditions of thumb sucking and an overreliance on pacifiers as a result pediatric dentists usually require an additional twoyear residency working with infants and childrenoral pathologist pathology refers to the study of disease specifically as it presents in tissue oral pathologists then are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups these experts are considered to be true specialists having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology though oral pathology is rather specialized its a vital component of the oral health industry by analyzing tissue taken from biopsies oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases including leukoplakia cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma among othersperiodontist similar to the endodontist periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school however whereas endodontists study advanced treatments periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis periodontitis which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment and other periodontal diseases periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds those people who require root planing  where dentists clean any infected surfaces  and root debridement or the removal of dead tissue periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health including painful recession and teeth alignmentcosmetic dentist most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and wellbeing of a patients teeth while that is important to cosmetic dentists they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth to begin the average appointment cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned the most popular such treatments are bleaching  where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth  placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth and bonding where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement materialorthodontist orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities which includes everything from misaligned jaws  like an under or overbite  to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues following dental school the wouldbe orthodontist then has another three years of schooling most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program to properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear that includes braces retainers and various facemask configurations though orthodontists work with people of all ages the bulk of patients are young children and teensprosthodontist similar to the field of orthodontics the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school and though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics its primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth prosthodontists have a number of teethreplacing procedures to implement including filling veneers onlays and inlays bridges crowns and complete or partial dentures beyond their work in implant dentistry these experts treat a number of other mouthrelated ailments namely snoring postcancer jaw reconstruction traumatic injuries and pain related to lock jaw and other temporomandibular joint disordersoral and maxillofacial radiologist similar to endodontists these specialists  one of nine such unique fields recognized by the american dental association  utilize machinery to treat and diagnose patients specifically these dentists make use of radiographic imaging to treat those diseases and ailments that impact the teeth mouth and the maxillofacial region which consists of the face and jaw while xrays are a popular option omrs also rely on plain and computed tomography mris ultrasounds and other forms of digital imaging omrs are among the first adaptors of new technology using innovations in the field of imaging to find increasingly effective ways at understanding the impact of oral disease and what that means to patientsoral and maxillofacial surgeon your primary dentist may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon if you experience facial pain or if he or she suspects you have some variety of oral cancer omss are also your primary source when planning most oral surgeries like tooth extractions cyst repairs and removals and dental implants however an oms can also treat a number of other ailments and diseases related to the maxillofacial region for instance malformations in your facial bones can cause sleep apnea and an oms can perform corrective surgery that removes or shapes bone many of these experts are also involved with more cosmetic procedures performing or assisting with facial implants and rhinoplasty in which the nose bone is modifieddental public health clinics these clinics are available in most cities across the us and theyre meant to offer affordable health care to many lowincome families and individuals though it differs depending on the specific clinic the average clinic offers only the most essential oral care services including xrays teeth cleaning basic root canals and repairs and tooth extractions the fees an individual pays depend on a number of different factors and most clinics have a slidingfee that is determined equally by income and family sizemost common oral care issuesthere are several different kinds of dentists each one with his or her own specialty however there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat conditions includetooth decay when your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth improper brushing is often to blame certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay one of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at homebad breath as your teeth fall out or you dont brush

regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwashteeth sensitivity some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold a lack of brushing can also comprise your teeths natural protection the best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teethdry mouth certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit this in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums there are several athome measures you can take to combat dry mouth these include regular hydration chewing sugarfree gum which also hydrates your mouth and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it which dries out your entire mouthteeth grinding for many people grinding their teeth  also known as bruxism  is a subconscious behavior usually the result of stress it can eventually damage your teeth the only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist who will fit you with with

then help develop a specific treatment plan including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwashdiscoloration yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits mainly smoking drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen however if your teeth become worse many dentists will treat with a whitening procedurea guide for dental care basicsproper oral care begins at home the following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy they just may reduce your time spent in your dentists chairremember your angles when brushing your teeth always place the brush at a degree angle that way youre able to hit every surface of each toothdont forget the tongue within your mouth your tongue is the largest source of bacteria be sure to brush it front to back and dont forget the sidesfloss everyday brushing alone isnt enough to keep your mouth healthy and thats why flossing is so important each time you floss be sure to have at least  inches of floss available which is what you should go through if you use proper technique for optimal control hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingerswatch what you eat sugar alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus while some can prove beneficial too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gumskeep in mind the mouthwash though not a requirement mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains however dont overuse mouthwash as it can cause a number of ailmentshow to choose the right dentistproper oral care is an integral component of your greater wellbeing which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical historyfind a recommendation its important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with because thats difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book you should always seek out a recommendation whether its a friend family member or coworker this individual can offer intimate details about a dentists demeanor operating style and approach to patient care be sure to always ask plenty of questionsvet your dentist once you get a recommendation from a friend dont simply book your first cleaning right away instead meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview during this session you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often procedures theyre not as familiar with what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentists scheduleconsider accessibility and other factors perhaps youve met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable not only that but this dentists payment options are suitable for your finances however dont be so quick to make a final decision as other factors may influence your choice is the dentists office nearby or do you have to drive out of your way is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule how much flexibility will the dentists staff offer in booking appointments though seemingly trivial these factors are nonetheless importantcheck with your state board one of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your states dental board dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet these organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentists background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actionspicking the right dental insuranceas with other forms of health care insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible however you dont want to simply buy the first such plan you see here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurancepick your plan there is no such thing as a onesizefitsall dental insurance plan instead most people purchase three main varieties usually through their employers an indemnity or feeforservice plan is just as it sounds and means youll have to pay for annual deductibles and coinsurance payments out of pocket a preferred provider organization is less costly and you choose from a network of dentists however ppos have some limitations and accompanying deductibles similarly a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs however these hmo are usually much less costlyexamine the networks as noted ppo plans and dental hmos work with only a select number of doctors while that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options it also means you dont have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you that doesnt necessarily have to be a bad thing especially if you know who is in the network before purchasing the plan youll receive a list of dentists in each network do research on each doctor  just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise from there you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirementsconsider your coverage sometimes its not just the doctor that you want to consider for many people even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice the reason the coverage is lessthanstellar when picking a plan you need to look at just how much youll pay for each and every service for instance some plans wont cover your fillings or xrays while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction knowing just what youll be responsible for is important as you dont want to be caught offguard by unforeseen charges depending on your employer a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage optionsmake your plan work for you its a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan youve purchased however that doesnt mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere if youre truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available that means potentially deal with costs and other insurancerelated factors that you might have wanted to if need be you might be able to work with the dentists office to address some of the planspecific concerns we just

ddsjason l ratedthere isn’t much more to say about the “dr wei experience” that hasn’t been said already dr wei and staff exceed all the standard requirements of what you want in a dental office and then some of course you get a friendly and courteous staff accurate scheduling i never wait clean office state of the art technology the needle vibrates to mitigate pain watch a movie during dental procedures and very reasonable pricing for the high quality of workbut what makes dr wei a great dentist in addition to his precise craftsmanship and desire for perfection is he is a great person his demeanor and warm personality which can only come naturally literally takes away the entire anxiety of a dentist visit you don’t feel like you are visiting a dentist you are visiting a friend that does dental workadditionally despite his often full schedule his attentiveness always makes me feel like i am his first and only patient on every visit examplesknowing i needed extensive work and that i travel  miles from work for each visit worth the trip he immediately calendared me in for multiple future visits and precisely calculated the procedures he’d perform each visit so to minimize my visits of course each visit went according to planhe knew i had a wedding to attend thus needed my cracked veneer replaced cracked veneer was from a former dentist concerned that the veneer would not be shipped to his office in time dr wei went out of his way on his day off to pick up the veneer from the lab so that i would have it in time for the wedding i am quite confident that none of my previous dentists would have even considered doing thatlastly the customer service provided by the staff is first class as of the very first visit they said that i would receive reimbursement from my dental insurance within  weeks and though i forgot about them i am skeptic with insurance companies it was a pleasant surprise the checks arrived the team is also very diligent with following up the very next day on any procedures performed to ensure i am comfortable they never miss a beatas such my search for a dedicated punctual reliable flexible honest knowledgeable caring pride in their work quality dentist has ended at dr wei and team like others i highly recommend dr wei if you are skeptical just chat with him for yourselfdr michael j wei ddspaula m ratedfirst let me start by saying i am a very honest reviewer and live my life by reviews for everything i do so this is my honest opiniondr wei and his staff are so amazing i went to several dentists to make my decision about who is going to do my veneer procedure as i was so embarrassed of my smile for years for me this was a big decision since it can get very costly depending on your needs after seeing around  different dentists i decided to go with dr wei i did as much research as i could on him and found with his credentials and the way he presented himself at my consolation won me over dr wei has a trusting caring way about him that made me so at ease from my first consultation up to the last day of my veneer procedure he offers different financial options that can help you pay for treatment and he always works with your schedule dr wei is so gentle and makes you feel so calm you wish you would have found him years ago as that is how i feel also amanda his assistant is so wonderful with your needs if i had any needs or concerns they would fit me in the same day with no problem just to make me feel happy and satisfied my new veneers look so beautiful and natural it will really amaze you to see the before and after i am no longer embarrassed to smile as i was or covering my mouth when i talk i am so much more confident and i can really cry when i think of what dr wei corrected that i was most self conscious about i will continue to see dr wei even if my dental insurance wont cover anything  that is how amazing he is if you are having any hesitations with who you should go see please go at least for a consultation with him you will not be disappointed and i know you will love him and he did veneers  cavities cleaning and much much more with the time frame i gave him and finished before my birthday as i asked even with his busy schedule he honestly made me so happy i cant thank him enough thanks dr wei  staffdr michael j wei ddsallie m ratedafter  different dentists botched up my veneers three times i was reluctant to go ahead for the fourth time the time the energy and pain of those three times almost made me throw in the towel and i went to drwei to see what he could do i found drwei online and found him impressive with the many awards and positive reviewsi went in for a consultation and starting from his receptionist to his dental assistant i felt that they were very professional and i was comforted drwei came to go over my teeth and he was very thorough with the exam after the hellish experience of getting veneers done  times i did not want to do veneers again and i asked him about lumineers he advised that it would be better for me to get veneers even though i was insistent that i get lumineers while he was understanding about my previous experiences he explained to me the reasons why he would redo the veneers our conversation gave me the confidence that it will be okay and i went ahead with the veneers im so glad i diddrwei is a perfectionist he does not want you to look anything but fabulous he is very caring about his patients and his work my case was quite difficult because i had missing teeth but the end result is positively amazing it looks natural but very nice i had headphones the whole time and i wasnt in pain at all drwei does a thorough job but hes quick so i didnt feel like it was taking forever honestly ive never felt so comfortable at a dental office beforeon top of all of this his prices are very reasonable you would think for such an in demand dentist in a prime location it would cost an arm and a leg to do veneers

dental insurance cigna with pleasure dr marks has a fun manner and friendly manner in the way he approaches his work and this is very welcome for me the implant work is flawless the crowns are flawless zero complications dr marks even fitted me with  veneers and color matched them to my natural teeth perfectly no one can tell the difference he could have easily recommended that i veneer the

three years of schooling most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program to properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear that includes braces retainers and various facemask configurations though orthodontists work with people of all ages the bulk of patients are young children and teensprosthodontist

recommendation whether its a friend family member or coworker this individual can offer intimate details about a dentists demeanor operating style and approach to patient care be sure to always ask plenty of questionsvet your dentist once you get a recommendation from a friend dont simply book your first cleaning right away instead meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview during this session you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often procedures theyre not as familiar with what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentists scheduleconsider accessibility and other factors perhaps youve met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable not only that but this dentists payment options are suitable for your finances however dont be so quick to make a final decision as other factors may

varieties usually through their employers an indemnity or feeforservice plan is just as it sounds and means youll have to pay for annual deductibles and coinsurance payments out of pocket a preferred provider organization is less costly and you choose from a network of dentists however ppos have some limitations and accompanying deductibles similarly a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs however these hmo are usually much less costlyexamine the networks as noted ppo plans and dental hmos work with only a select number of doctors while that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options it also means you dont have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you that doesnt necessarily have to be a bad thing especially if you know who is in the network before purchasing the plan youll receive a list of dentists in each network do research on each doctor  just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise from there you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirementsconsider your coverage sometimes its not just the doctor that you want to consider for many people even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice the reason the coverage is lessthanstellar when picking a plan you need to look at just how much youll pay for each and every service for instance some plans wont cover your fillings or xrays while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction knowing just what youll be responsible for is important as you dont want to be caught offguard by unforeseen charges depending on your employer a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage optionsmake your plan work for you its a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan youve purchased however that doesnt mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere if youre truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available that means potentially deal with costs and other insurancerelated factors that you might have wanted to if need be you might be able to work with the dentists office to address some of the planspecific concerns we just
