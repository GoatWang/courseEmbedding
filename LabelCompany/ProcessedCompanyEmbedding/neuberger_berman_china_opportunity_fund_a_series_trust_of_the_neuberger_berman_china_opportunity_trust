neuberger funds june   larry swedroe in this installment of our continuing series on the ability of actively managed fund families to generate alpha well evaluate the recent performance of equity funds managed by neuberger berman to determine if the firm adds value for its investors regardless of whether it actually delivers on its promise it seems neuberger bermans active riskdisciplined strategies are attracting investors in droves morningstar reports that as of may   the firm had  billion in assets up from about the  billion it had at the end of  background on neuberger berman according to its website neuberger berman has been actively observing and investing in the global markets for over seven decades the firm goes on to state the strength of our investment culture derives in part from our emphasis on original thinking and fundamental research complemented by our embrace of a diversity of investment strategies to help our clients achieve their unique investment objectives it then continues our research is proprietary conducted and disseminated for the exclusive use of our  portfolio management teams for the benefits of our clients in  we hosted over  meetings with companies in our offices alone … the firm remains relevant to our clients because we remain committed to finding opportunities both traditional and nontraditional in todays marketplace and finally our experienced managers and our longterm outlook help define and motivate our approach and our decisionmaking … managing risk is a central function in our culture at neuberger berman famously articulated by our eponymous founder as the mission of preserving our clients hardearned capital the firm employs a rigorous welldefined risk management framework staffed by dedicated operational risk professionals separate from our portfolio managers but are the funds managed by neuberger berman a better choice than passively managed alternatives active vs passive as is our practice well compare the performance of neuberger bermans actively managed funds to similar offerings in the same asset classes from two prominent providers of passively managed funds dimensional fund advisors dfa and vanguard full disclosure my firm buckingham recommends dfa funds in constructing client portfolios to keep the comparison to a manageable number of funds as well as to make sure we examine longterm results through full economic cycles our analysis will cover the year period from april  through march  in addition when more than one class of fund is available for the full period well use the lowestcost shares in cases where neuberger berman has more than one fund in an asset class we will use the average return of the applicable funds the table below shows the performance of eight neuberger berman funds in six asset classes      april  to march  fund symbol annualizedreturn  expenseratio  us large blend        neuberger berman focus investor class nbssx

cap growth investor class nbmix   neuberger berman average     vanguard small cap growth index investor class visgx       following is a synopsis of the most important takeaways from the data in the table above while the neuberger berman funds outperformed the dfa funds in two of the three asset classes in which comparable funds were available a neuberger berman portfolio equalweighted in those three asset classes returned  percent underperforming a comparable portfolio from dfa which returned  percent in the two asset classes where neuberger berman funds outperformed the average outperformance was  percentage points in the asset class where the neuberger berman fund underperformed the gap was  percentage points this is consistent with the overall evidence on active management which shows that when active funds do outperform the outperformance tends to be relatively small on the other hand when they underperform the gap tends to be greater also the average expense ratio for the neuberger berman portfolio was  percent versus just  percent for the dfa portfolio note that the underperformance of the neuberger berman portfolio was more than fully explained by the difference in average expense ratio  percentage points   including vanguard in the comparison in the six asset classes for which comparable vanguard funds were available an equalweighted portfolio of neuberger berman funds returned  percent the portfolios average expense ratio was  percent a vanguard portfolio equalweighted in those same six asset classes returned  percent a full  percentage points more than the neuberger berman portfolio in the two asset classes where neuberger berman funds outperformed the average outperformance was  percentage points in the four asset classes where neuberger berman funds underperformed the gap was  percentage points once again we see evidence that when active management outperforms that outperformance tends to be smaller than the level of active management underperformance when it occurs the average expense ratio for the vanguard portfolio was  percent in this case the higher expenses of the neuberger berman funds explained more than  percent of the difference in returns     factor analysis well now take another look at the performance of neuberger berman funds using the analytical tools and data available at portfolio visualizer   ive added two additional neuberger berman funds to this list the reason they werent included in the prior analysis is because there are no comparable funds from either vanguard or dfa that were available for the full year period   the following table shows the results of the threefactor beta size and value fourfactor adding momentum and sixfactor adding quality and low beta analysis for the firms

positive annual alphas the average annual alpha was  percent only one funds alpha was statistically significant at the  percent level and its alpha was  percent   when we look at results from the fourfactor analysis we also find that five of the  neuberger berman funds generated positive annual alphas the average annual alpha was  percent two funds produced alphas that were statistically significant at the  percent level and they were both negative   when we include all six factors we find that just three of the  funds generated positive alphas the average alpha was  percent which is slightly less than the average expense ratio of the neuberger berman funds none of the alphas was statistically significant at the  percent level   its worse than it looks before summarizing there are two additional important points to consider first all of the data above is based on pretax results for investors holding these funds in taxable accounts the active management of neuberger berman almost certainly would have produced greater negative tax consequences than the passively managed alternatives of either dfa or vanguard second morningstar data unfortunately contain survivorship bias thus its possible there were neuberger berman funds that had performed poorly in the past and were either merged into betterperforming funds or closed if that were the case the data will overstate returns earned by the firms investors   while neuberger bermans website states that … the firm remains relevant to our clients because we remain committed to finding opportunities both traditional and nontraditional in todays marketplace … the analysis demonstrates that its efforts at finding opportunity have not translated into superior returns for investors   in the cases comparing to both dfa and vanguard funds neuberger bermans funds were subtracting value and thats even before considering the important issues of survivorship bias and for taxable investors taxes   but letting alone those two important considerations in terms of the factor analysis there was no evidence that neuberger bermans fund managers were able to persistently exploit market inefficiencies larry swedroe is the

morningstar has rated its risk above the th percentile when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics
