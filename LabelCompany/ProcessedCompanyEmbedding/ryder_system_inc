exclude  of nonoperating pension cost and  in pensionrelated adjustments our second quarter results were above the highend of our forecast range of  to  due to better than expected performance in our contractual lease and maintenance product lines as well as in commercial rental outperformance in these areas was partially offset by lower than expected results in used vehicle sales due to valuation adjustments taken to better position the fleet for future sale and in supply chain due to lower than planned automotive volumes dedicated performance was in line with our expectations operating revenue which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation increased by  to a record  billion for the second quarter and was higher in all business segments despite rental revenue being down by  excluding the impact of foreign exchange operating revenue increased by  total revenue increased by  reflecting higher subcontracted transportation driven by new business and increased operating

from last year return on capital was negative  basis points down from a  basis points positive spread in the prior year driven by lower performance in used vehicle sales and commercial rental ill turn now to page  and discuss some key trends that we saw in the business segments during the quarter fleet management solutions operating revenue which excludes fuel was just slightly up from the prior year as growth in the contractual choicelease and selectcare products was offset primarily by lower commercial rental revenue and foreign exchange choicelease revenue increased by over  due to fleet growth second quarter revenue comparisons were adversely impacted by fleet mix foreign exchange and high mileage activity in the prior year we continue to expect fullyear choicelease revenue growth of  the lease fleet excluding uk trailers decreased by  vehicles sequentially but increased by  vehicles yeartodate adjusting for a reduction this quarter in an elevated number of vehicles being prepared for sale which provides a more relevant comparison to our forecast the lease fleet grew by approximately  vehicles sequentially and  vehicles yeartodate we remain on track to achieve our fullyear growth forecast of around  vehicles  will represent our sixth consecutive year of organic lease fleet growth choicelease continues to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends as well as sales and marketing initiatives so far this year more than  of our new lease sales came from customers new to outsourcing up from the prior two years selectcare revenue increased  as higher growth in selectcare full service and selectcare preventive contract business was partially offset by flat billings for ancillary maintenance services which is also reported in this line item were pleased with the fleet growth were seeing in our selectcare full service and preventive product lines the fleet grew by  vehicles yeartodate an increase by  vehicles sequentially representing significant new customer wins

average rental fleet decreased  yearoveryear the ending rental fleet was down by  or  vehicles yearoveryear while it was up slightly sequentially as we enter the seasonally stronger demand period as a result of these fleet rightsizing actions as well as modestly better than expected rental demand utilization on power units was  up  basis points yearoveryear representing significantly improved utilization comparisons versus the first quarter vehicles redeployed into other applications were up by  yeartodate redeployment activity reduced the amount of capital needed to fulfill new customer contracts which benefited cash flow lease extensions increased by approximately  vehicles or  yeartodate primarily reflecting activity with a large customer on a fleet of trailers used vehicle results for the quarter were down year over year due to a weak used vehicle environment and higher valuation adjustments ill discuss those results separately in a few minutes overall fms earnings decreased due to lower used vehicle and commercial rental results partially offset by higher choicelease and selectcare results accelerated depreciation of  million and higher maintenance cost on certain older model year vehicles also negatively impacted results earnings before tax in fms decreased  fms earnings as a percent of operating revenue were  down  basis points from the prior year ill turn now to dedicated transportation on page  total dts segment revenue grew  while operating revenue was up by  this quarter inline with our initial fullyear forecast reflecting new business were seeing stronger growth this year with dedicated services provided as part of multiservice solutions which is reported in our supply chain segment dedicated operating revenue within our reported supply chain segment grew by  for the second quarter and  yeartodate our sales team remains focused on upselling our current lease customers to dedicated additionally we continue to target prospects who are new to outsourcing which has recently represented about half of this segments growth earnings in the dedicated segment decreased  primarily due to higher maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles and higher insurance premiums reflecting insurance market conditions segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were  down  basis points from the prior year ill turn now to supply chain solutions on page  total revenue grew by  and operating revenue grew by  due to new business increased volumes and higher pricing supply chain earnings before taxes however were down  primarily due to the startup phase of certain new accounts segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were  for the quarter down  basis points from the prior year at this point ill turn the call over to our cfo art garcia to cover several items including capital spending art a garcia  ryder system inc thanks robert turning to page  yeartodate gross capital expenditures totaled over  million down around  million from the prior year this decrease primarily reflects lower planned investments in the lease fleet partially offset by higher planned investments to refresh the rental fleet we realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue earning equipment of  million down  million from the prior year the decrease reflects lower sales pricing and volumes net capital expenditures decreased by  million to  million fullyear  gross capital expenditures are now expected to be down by  million from our initial forecast this primarily reflects a greater use of used equipment to fulfill new lease contracts turning to the next page we generated cash from operating activities of  million yeartodate down  the decrease was driven primarily by increased working capital requirements partially offset by lower pension contributions we generated  million of total cash yeartodate down  million from the prior year cash payments for capital expenditures decreased by around  million to  million yeartodate the companys free cash flow was positive  million yeartodate versus the prior year of negative  million reflecting lower capital expenditures we are maintaining our fullyear  forecast for free cash flow of positive  million as lower operating cash flow is offset by lower capital expenditures page  addresses our debttoequity position total debt of  billion is basically flat with yearend  debttoequity at the end of the second quarter decreased to  from  at the end of  the company has a longterm debttoequity target which is focused on achieving a competitive cost of capital while maintaining a solid investmentgrade credit rating the target range is periodically reviewed based on a combination of factors based on our most recent review weve revised the target range from  to  to a range of  to  this revised range is consistent with the longstanding historical target range that was in place prior to mid our forecast for balance sheet leverage at yearend remains unchanged at  which would place us somewhat below the revised target range equity at the end of the quarter was just over  billion up  million from yearend  primarily due to earnings and foreign exchange partially offset by share repurchase and dividends at this point ill hand the call back over to robert to provide an asset management update robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thanks art page  summarizes key results in our asset management area used vehicle inventory held for sale was  vehicles at quarterend this excludes the elevated number of vehicles being prepared for sale that i mentioned earlier a more relevant comparison which includes these vehicles would result in used vehicle inventory of approximately  units down  vehicles year over year and unchanged sequentially we sold  used vehicles during the quarter down  from the prior year and down  sequentially proceeds per vehicles sold were down  for tractors and down  for trucks compared to a year ago from a sequential standpoint tractor pricing was down  and truck pricing was down  as i mentioned earlier pricing was better than expected especially for trucks as compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter of  overall used prices were down  we continue to sell a higher than normal number of vehicles through our wholesale channel although the retail mix improved to  in the second quarter versus  in the first quarter the higher than normal use of wholesaling this year is part of our plan to move inventory levels to the midpoint of our target range of  to  vehicles by yearend which will better position the used fleet as we go into  ill turn now to page  to cover our outlook during the second quarter we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of a challenging environment in used vehicle sales and rental while growing our contractual businesses our contractual products choicelease dedicated and supply chain all generated revenue growth during the quarter and will provide the majority of the companys earnings during  as these products generally represent  to year contractual revenue streams growing this portfolio helps to mitigate cyclical volatility from used vehicle sales and rental and positions us well for when these transactional businesses stabilize and recover our overall earnings outlook for the balance of the year remains on track with our prior expectations as a modestly better outlook for fms is offset by a somewhat lower expected results in supply chain and dedicated in choicelease we grew the fleet by approximately  vehicles yeartodate after adjusting for an elevated number of used vehicles being prepared for sale considering the timing of new sales and vehicle deliveries we remain on track to achieve our fullyear lease fleet growth of around  vehicles were also pleased that the percentage of new leased vehicles from customers new to outsourcing is above  up from the prior two years selectcare full service and preventive are also benefiting from strong sales activity with fleet growth of  vehicles yeartodate in rental yearoveryear utilization comparisons improved significantly as a result of somewhat better than expected rental demand and our timely actions to align the fleet size and mix with market demands looking ahead were anticipating normal secondhalf seasonality for rental and expect the balance of the year performance to be in line with our prior expectations since weve appropriately rightsized the rental fleet for the current environment we anticipate that utilization will remain within the target range with flat yearoveryear pricing for the second half of the year in used vehicle sales the environment continues to be challenging but somewhat stabilizing with high levels of class  inventory still in the market we now expect used vehicle pricing to decline between  and  on a fullyear yearoveryear basis which is slightly reduced from the prior forecast during the quarter we prepared a higher than normal number of vehicles for sale and also made additional valuation adjustments in order to reflect market conditions and better position the inventory for sale we continue to expect inventory of around  vehicles by yearend which is at the midpoint of the longterm target range in supply chain balance of the year results are expected to be slightly below the prior expectations due to lower automotive volumes at select plants and higher investments in technology particularly impacting the third quarter as new business ramps up in the fourth quarter supply chain margins will benefit and be more normalized dedicated is expected to see some more modest additional secondhalf earnings impact from higher insurance cost reflecting insurance market conditions given the higher than expected second quarter earnings and an unchanged outlook for the balance of the year were raising our fullyear comparable eps forecast range to  to  from  to  our third quarter comparable earnings per share forecast of  to  versus the prior year of  third quarter forecast reflects earnings comparisons that are still down yearoveryear but improved from those in the second quarter we anticipate positive yearoveryear earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter the seasonality of earnings in the third and fourth quarters is somewhat different than historical comparisons primarily due to supply chain earnings in the third quarter supply chain earnings will be impacted by lower auto volumes and higher it investments while supply chain earnings in the fourth quarter will benefit from the rampup of signed new business in addition used vehicle results and accelerated depreciation are also impacting quarterly results versus historical years on a fullyear basis although earnings are projected to be down this year as compared to two years ago the quality of the earnings is much higher with  of our earnings expected to come from contractual businesses versus approximately  in  that concludes our prepared remarks this morning at this time ill turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions in order to give everyone an opportunity please limit yourself to one question and one related followup if clarification is needed if you have additional questions youre welcome to get back in the queue and well take as many calls as we can questionandanswer session operator well pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions and well take our first question from ben hartford with baird ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc hey good morning everybody i guess robert lets start on the supply chain side in the auto exposure and some of the headwinds here  of that business is tied to auto is it – could you talk a little bit about the sources of the weakness there is it from any particular oem with which you do business or is it just broader pressure to usr  in particular thats one and then two within that segment youre somewhat underrepresented in healthcare and perhaps retail you talk about new business wins but what is the opportunity to be able to offset some of the headwinds in auto cyclically through sales efforts on – within these other verticals going forward to kind of drive to that midsingledigit type operating revenue target that youve talked about historically in that segment robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i – ben ill tell you that we cant comment on specific accounts but i think if you listen to whats going on in the auto industry where youre having some slowdown certainly in certain models across a lot of the different oems i think its just consistent with that but the offset to that is the sales that were seeing really in supply chain across all verticals i would say even including in auto with some new businesses were picking up so thats why were talking about the fourth quarter really earnings coming back stronger versus the third quarter and also revenue and thats really from  some of the new growth so steve if you want to add some additional color j steven sensing  ryder system inc yeah ben i would say that if you think about the diversity we deal with a number of oems and across those plants youve got a good diverse model portfolio as well so really its around a rampup of new volume associated in the quarter and as you think about q youve got some model year changeover so theres a little softness there as well so – but i think as robert commented on the portfolio were seeing good healthy pipeline across all verticals good strong growth so we expect that to be pretty even across the verticals as we go into the back half ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc okay good and then switching gears on the commercial rental side robert could you talk about the trends through the quarter kind of uniformly on the broader truckload side spot activity did firm up in june slightly above seasonal want to see if that was your experience as well what are you experiencing in july and what is the outlook in terms of rental utilization relative to expectations in the back half of the year from a demand point of view how much of the improvement in utilization is the supply reductions that youve talked about versus perhaps some recent improvement in underlying demand thanks robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i think ben we did see almost i would say consistent with what you heard from the truckload guys we did see improvement in the second quarter better than what we had expected id say slightly better than seasonal so we have some of that built into the balance of the year and were expecting to get as you can see some improvement in utilization as a result of that so we didnt quite bring the fleet down as much as we had originally expected i think because of we saw better than expected utilization so now were looking to really see that continue through the balance of the year so dennis i dont know if you want to give more detail dennis c cooke  ryder system inc i would say that february and march were tough as we shared before from a demand point of view and we expected it to perform seasonally after that and as robert said it performed slightly better and as a result we didnt defleet as much as we had originally planned and so we did see some strengthening in demand robert e sanchez  ryder system inc in july were seeing really consistent with  q dennis c cooke  ryder system inc consistent yeah ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc consistent with q so above seasonal in july and then it sounded like youre expecting slightly above seasonal trends here to finish out the year is that right robert e sanchez  ryder system inc slightly above slightly ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc okay okay thank you operator and well take our next question from justin long with stephens justin long  stephens inc thanks and good morning art a garcia  ryder system inc good morning robert e sanchez  ryder system inc good morning justin justin long  stephens inc so robert i think you mentioned in your comments that used truck sales were about  retail in the quarter and im curious was that number a little bit higher than what you were expecting and as we look at the guidance going forward what are you baking in in terms of that split between retail and wholesale in the back half of the year robert e sanchez  ryder system inc ill let dennis dennis c cooke  ryder system inc yeah justin it was basically in line with what we had forecast and going forward were projecting it to be slightly below as we continue to get the amount of units in the utc down so but basically in line as we were forecasting previously justin long  stephens inc okay and slightly below im guessing like maybe  retail  wholesale something in that ballpark robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i think it was a little higher than that i think were expecting the fullyear to end right around  right about  for the fullyear justin long  stephens inc okay thats helpful and then secondly i wanted to ask about  robert e sanchez  ryder system inc im sorry justin let me just mention one thing justin long  stephens inc sure robert e sanchez  ryder system inc i think on the call i mentioned that truck pricing sequentially was down  truck pricing was actually up  sequentially so i wanted to make that correction justin long  stephens inc okay thats helpful to clarify and secondly i wanted to ask about fsl i think youve talked historically about targeting a return of  to  basis points above your cost of capital just curious where that spread stands today and going forward do you think that target of  to  basis points is still achievable if the used truck market doesnt recover robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i think were in that range were not going to get – i wont get into a lot of detail but if you look at return on capital spreads across our business i mean leases continue to be strong obviously the challenge has been that we went from used vehicle gains of  million now to slightly down so but we really priced this business with breakeven at the end on the gain side so i would say that the lease pricing should still remain very competitive even given what weve seen so far on the used truck side justin long  stephens inc okay thats helpful ill leave it at that appreciate the time robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thank you justin operator well take our next question from todd fowler with keybanc capital markets todd c fowler  keybanc capital markets inc great thanks good morning i was hoping you could help us understand just the expectations for used vehicle gains or losses in the back half of the year are you expecting to continue to have losses on used vehicle sales it looks like yeartodate the line is about a  loss and i think the original guidance was around  so whats the expectation for gains or losses on used vehicle sales into the back half and if you can also help us understand maybe whats in the third quarter guidance that could be helpful robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah were expecting a breakeven so id say flat for the balance of the year obviously we had i think it was  loss in q and that was primarily driven by the valuation adjustments that we took in the second quarter were not forecasting to need to take those in q and q so thats why youre seeing that change so i would say its the pricing environment similar to what we had said prior maybe a little bit better just because we didnt see it – we saw it firming up a little bit but still obviously challenge is going into the second half todd c fowler  keybanc capital markets inc okay that helps and then well probably see this in the q but what was the exact dollar amount of the valuation allowances this quarter art a garcia  ryder system inc for the quarter it was  million todd gains of  million valuation of  million gets you to the negative  million todd c fowler  keybanc capital markets inc perfect that helps art okay and then just for my followup what is the age of the lease fleet currently and what was it in the first quarter and what was it in the year ago if you have that robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i think dennis has that dennis c cooke  ryder system inc yeah todd its  months and it was  months in the first quarter in the second quarter of  it was  months so its one month older todd c fowler  keybanc capital markets inc great okay thanks for the help this morning and good job turning things around from q robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thank you todd art a garcia  ryder system inc thanks todd operator well take our next question from scott group with wolfe research scott h group  wolfe research llc hey thanks morning guys so want to stick on the used vehicle side so since you accelerated some depreciation in the second quarter are you raising your expectations for third and fourth quarter gains on sales i know you just said you think theyre kind of breakeven i dont know if thats a change thats better than what you were previously expecting art a garcia  ryder system inc yeah the net is probably up a little bit because obviously we did a good job in the second quarter of bringing in more units than we had anticipated so some of those units there was a pl impact that was in our prior guidance so the uvs results are a little bit better than what they were before scott h group  wolfe research llc so i guess if we have better used vehicle and better rental im not sure why youre not – i understand supply chain is a little weaker but thats a much smaller part of the business i guess im not entirely sure why youre not raising the outlook for the second half of the year robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i think scott it was – its really – supply chain is obviously being impacted by the lower auto volumes and investments were making in technology so those are the – thats really the biggest driver of the offset and then weve also got some additional investments were making in other areas of the business that are helping to offset it but yeah thats how the numbers are falling out scott h group  wolfe research llc okay and then if i can just ask just on – staying on used vehicles so like if the pricing was a little bit better than you thought in the second quarter why are you doing the accelerated depreciation and is that something that youre going to – you plan to do more of going forward and then how does that impact residual value for  do you think thats a positive or negative kind of earnings in  residual value art a garcia  ryder system inc yeah i mean pricing was modestly above where we thought i dont want you to think it was significantly above to begin with so well have to just look at it obviously increasing price is always going to help us from an accelerated depreciation but i mean for the quarter it wasnt a big impact to the process of what were trying to get done with that so i think from that sense i dont think its going to have a big impact well have to wait and see as we get further down to the year to decide around accelerated depreciation scott h group  wolfe research llc and then just thoughts on residual value for next year art a garcia  ryder system inc yeah the residual values i mean remember it was only up modestly so i dont think it has a big effect on where we are so our views about the residual impact is still there its what we think were going to have some additional headwind next year around some residual value changes so that really hasnt changed scott h group  wolfe research llc okay all right thank you guys art a garcia  ryder system inc okay operator and well take our next question from david ross with stifel david ross  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes good morning gentlemen just continuing on the choicelease side the higher maintenance costs that were talked about in the quarter on older vehicles you talked about it on the last call as well were they i guess as expected higher or were they higher than you had expected them to be and what does the tail look like on these older vehicles robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah these are – they were inline with what we had expected i would argue maybe slightly – actually maintenance costs were little bit better than what we had expected but these are units that are going to be really exiting the fleet within the next id call it  months so youre really talking about through  so these are the more challenging units were going to be replacing those during that period of time so thats – those are the vehicles – thats the item that were mentioning david ross  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay so this is still the  problem child had there been any other issues that have popped up since kind of the  model years where maintenance costs have been higher than you expected when you wrote the contracts robert e sanchez  ryder system inc no no were seeing relatively good performance really on all the vehicles after those david ross  stifel nicolaus  co inc and then last question on the lease side relates actually more to the maintenance under fms the vehicles that are under ondemand maintenance still seeing good growth there but is the profitability tracking as expected robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah it is it is as weve mentioned before obviously the growth – it hasnt grown to the level that we want it to grow yet its growing slower but certainly it gives us an opportunity to tap into a different market than we have historically and also give us more flexibility around some of the selectcare and choicelease offerings dennis c cooke  ryder system inc david its dennis i would just add to that as robert was saying that we thought this would be a dooropener to as an entrée for a lot of customers an onramp if you will where once theyve come in and experienced our maintenance were able to sell them up to other selectcare and even choicelease products david ross  stifel nicolaus  co inc a door opener but not loss leader robert e sanchez  ryder system inc correct no no dennis c cooke  ryder system inc no no absolutely not profitability is in line robert e sanchez  ryder system inc profitability is in line with our earlier expectation david ross  stifel nicolaus  co inc excellent thank you operator well take our next question from jeff kauffman with aegis capital jeffrey kaufman  aegis capital corp thank you very much hi everyone robert e sanchez  ryder system inc morning jeffrey kaufman  aegis capital corp a couple questions here one having to do with fleet size so if im thinking about what youre saying correctly were going to add about  i guess  vehicles to full service lease before the end of the year and then i think we were originally thinking the rental fleet may be sized down but it sounds like youre saying were going to be around that  vehiclecount in rental can you kind of tell me whether im barking up the right tree or heading in the wrong direction robert e sanchez  ryder system inc were going to be – i know youre – on the choicelease side youre exactly right were on our original plan on the rental dennis youve got  dennis c cooke  ryder system inc rental will take it down slightly but thats just what we do seasonally but as we said the demand is slightly stronger than what we had originally projected so we wont be taking the fleet down as much as we originally planned jeffrey kaufman  aegis capital corp and thats based on the  utilization rate thats just saying we shouldnt reduce it by that much okay and then a followup question youve raised your targeted leverage range and i know historically weve said when we get below the range we start to consider things like share buyback in excess of antidilutive so does that logic still hold as you plan to be below the range toward the end of year art a garcia  ryder system inc yeah no our position hasnt changed were committed to staying within our target leverage range but as we talked about before its always predicated on the views of what our organic growth opportunities are what ma is out there things like that as a way to first – be the first call on capital if you will so our view hasnt changed and well continue to look at it as we go forward were only slightly below by the end of the year as it is jeffrey kaufman  aegis capital corp okay fair point and then finally you had talked about how the realization on some of the vehicle sales has been a little bit better than what you anticipated can you give us a little more context as to whether or not its a particular kind of geography a particular kind of vehicle type and kind of how have you been surprised and how is this changing your view on where we go with used vehicle sales robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah id say its modestly better and its really – its been trucks if i had to say one of them trucks have come in a little better – came in a little better in the second quarter than we expected tractors its hard to tell if theyre better the decline certainly yearoveryear has subsided some so theres some talk out there that maybe the prices are bottoming out right now theres still a lot if inventory in the market so were still focused on moving those units out i wouldnt say its really changed our outlook much yet obviously wed have to see several quarters of stabilization of pricing and then continued volumes moving out so our inventories come down before we change our view jeffrey kaufman  aegis capital corp okay well congratulations and thank you robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thank you jeff art a garcia  ryder system inc thanks jeff operator and well take our next question from brian ossenbeck with jpmorgan brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question so you talked about the scs already in auto i wanted to ask what youre seeing on the retail side obviously there is – they argue  theres more disruption than just some retooling and production that youre seeing in auto you do see a broader push into omnichannel and finalmile broadly speaking so just wondering if you could give us some thoughts on that vertical and if youre seeing any trouble finding the right sort of staffing levels operating locations as more and more focus tends to be on getting the warehouse the fulfillment centers in general closer to the end consumer j steven sensing  ryder system inc no brian i think that as you look at the quarter we had nice growth in retail cpg at  so were seeing again a consistent healthy pipeline in that book of business the teams focused on several initiatives which is just as you described to get product closer to our customers and to continue to buildout our finalmile solutions so very focused in that area and i think the omnichannel ecommerce is going to really impact positively all verticals as we look out in the far term so were excited about that and i think positioned well brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc okay and any trouble finding labor force in an area that youre expanding in or just flatout finding the space i know oftentimes you get a lease with a contract so just some thoughts on how thats progressing in the last quarter and how you think thats going to pan out for rest of the year j steven sensing  ryder system inc yeah our head count is up yearoveryear about  i would say that our time to fill is pretty consistent over last year so not really seeing any negative impact to that space remains available in key markets certainly youre going to go into some zip codes and have pressure there but there is a lot of new construction in these key areas as well we just recently opened up a brand new  million square foot for a customer up in the northeast so you may see some compression but right now we havent seen anything to speak of brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks and on the used vehicle side obviously a lot has been talked about already i was just wondering if youve done any work and have some historical context just about shadow inventory if we do get stabilization to actually improvement in pricing in the markets do you have a sense of just how much additional supply could come to the market if we get a sort of stable to increasing path here i dont know if you could size it relative to what you have currently or just maybe some broader comments would be helpful robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah look when we kind of determined our view of this we build that into our view right so as we look at what we think we assume used vehicle pricing is going to remain soft at least through middle of next year that is assuming that there is clearly – theres always been a shadow inventory out there thats kind of waiting for pricing to come up so it could come to market so were expecting thats out there and thats going to – that would continue to kind of create some pressure so i would argue – i would tell you thats kind of – thats already built into our view brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc okay and just a quick followup on that do you have just a rough sense of how big how wide the shadow has cast if its – like you say theres always something there but just some way to think about it relative to i dont know this time last year or at the trough of the last cycle would be helpful robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i think – look i think youve seen some of the stuff we had last year come to market already as vehicles continue to depreciate with carriers and with shippers that are out – i mean with fleets that are out there so youve seen some of that already coming to market and i think as pricing comes back up and vehicles continue to appreciate theres still more to be at because there was a lot of vehicles built in  and  and into  so those vehicles will cycle through as pricing comes up brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for your time robert e sanchez  ryder system inc all right thanks brian operator well take our next question from casey deak with wells fargo casey s deak  wells fargo securities llc thank you just wanted to touch a little bit on the asset management and specifically with things getting a little better here in the rental and some of the pricing on used vehicle sales does your strategy change at all or when youre looking at shifting assets around or would your ability to do that shift at all going into the back half of the year do you still have runway to move rental – or to move older lease vehicles into rental if you must and if thats going to help the overall operation dennis c cooke  ryder system inc yeah casey this is dennis were always looking at vehicles that come off lease and still have more mileage left and well look at bringing them into rental if it makes sense so were constantly looking at that from an asset management point of view and on the other hand were always looking at opportunities to take rental vehicles and move them into longer term lease commitments and so we continue to do that nothing has changed there robert e sanchez  ryder system inc so there is still some opportunity id say to the back end of your question is that we have opportunity for the balance of the year there is some i mean obviously its not an infinite number but theres opportunity if demand comes a little higher to bring some additional vehicles into the rental fleet casey s deak  wells fargo securities llc okay and kind of on top of that the capex comments around rental being a little higher proportion of what youre doing there in the capex is that generally going to be just replenishment youre not looking because you are taking you said a little bit down on the overall fleet number so whats like the percentage of the fleet there that you think you have to turn over on an annual basis or this year robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah its all replacement really were going to spend  million this year  million to  million were going to spend in rental and thats really all replacement replacement spend for us is probably around  million so were even sub our normal replacement where last year we only spent  million so weve really had two years of subreplacement level which as we move into the next few years youll probably see some of that come up casey s deak  wells fargo securities llc okay understood thank you robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thank you operator well take our next question from kevin sterling with seaport global securities kevin sterling  seaport global securities llc thank you good morning gentlemen robert e sanchez  ryder system inc good morning kevin kevin sterling  seaport global securities llc so robert you talked about the greater use of used equipment to fulfill lease contracts maybe you can give us some perspective is this higher than historical norms and maybe what is the average age of used equipment youre putting on a lease now so maybe just you could put in some historical context for us like i said is this typical is this higher than typically youve seen in the past and then lastly how much of a discount does a customer get on a lease price by taking a piece of used equipment if any robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah it is higher than historical norms there is some discount we dont really get into that but its just in some cases a slight discount to take a somewhat older vehicle in terms of the age of what were redeploying dennis c cooke  ryder system inc yeah i would say kevin it would be in the range of two years to three years in that range and customers who are looking for used equipment its a nice option and then if we see strong rental demand well backfill it with a new unit so this is one of the ways to keep the rental fleet refreshed or to downsize the rental fleet when youre seeing soft demand so were open for business when it comes to as we call it rental to lease options kevin sterling  seaport global securities llc yeah and i imagine and correct me if im wrong you guys have probably gotten good traction with this because of your superior maintenance program and customers understand that is that a fair statement dennis c cooke  ryder system inc yeah i think customers look at the uptime that we provide with our maintenance and its viewed favorably and the equipments that theyre buying the used equipments they know its taken care of very well kevin sterling  seaport global securities llc and so last along those lines you guys had mentioned – robert you talked about getting vehicles ready for sale that seems to be little bit higher than i think historical norms from what i can remember and with some of the engine complexities and everything does it cost more to get these vehicles ready for sale than historically maybe a couple years ago robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thats a good question just to give you the background we had plenty of vehicles to sell several quarters ago we started slowing down a little bit the process of getting them outserviced and at the end of the first quarter we had i think  vehicles above normal if you will in that process of getting ready for sale so we really bit into that pretty well this year we took a nice chunk out of it we are down to  vehicles now over the normal and plan to be at normal levels by the end of the year so yes there is some cost to doing that i would tell you because of the technology that cost would naturally go up however were very pleased that dennis and his team have done a great job of focusing on streamlining some of that work and actually bringing those costs down over the last year to two years so yes it naturally would go up but id say the initiatives that weve put in place and denniss team have put in place and executed have really helped to bring those costs down kevin sterling  seaport global securities llc well great thanks for your time today i really appreciate it take care robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thank you art a garcia  ryder system inc thanks kevin operator well take our next question from john cummings with copeland capital john r cummings  copeland capital management llc hi good morning i just wanted to ask about the deceleration youve seen in the choicelease business over the past few quarters in terms of revenue going from sort of the midsingle digit range to now  and it sounds like thats consistent with your expectations but can you just talk about whats driving that maybe in terms of market share or competition or just general trends towards outsourcing robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i would tell you that the  was in line with our expectation it just has to do with the timing of when sales happen when customers want vehicles were really on track for our  number for the full year and in terms of the slowdown you would argue from  versus the   that we saw last year its really been a result of just the lower oem production youve got fewer opportunities to go after as fewer trucks are being built so even though were still getting more than our fair share of it with the trends towards outsourcing youre just not seeing as many opportunities as we did just a couple of years ago with oem production being down so dennis you want to add a little color dennis c cooke  ryder system inc yeah robert what id add to it is when you look at the mix of new versus used as weve been redeploying more units youve got used equipment that doesnt get as high a price but more revenue – less revenue than we would see with new equipment so another piece robert robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thats a good point yeah the elevated levels of redeployment we have do impact that revenue growth some too so those are probably the two biggest factors john r cummings  copeland capital management llc okay thanks and then just a followup in terms of pricing of leasing contracts how does a potential increase in interest rates affect the pricing and then maybe what interest rates are the most important the shortterm or longterm robert e sanchez  ryder system inc well we price our vehicles really based on our mediumterm notes which is really how we fund how we fund the fiveyear notes so thats how we fund the assets so the way that our pricing works is as interest rates change we immediately make the change in our pricing model and the next vehicle that we buy is going to be bought with the – and we price is going to be priced with the higher interest rate john r cummings  copeland capital management llc okay thanks thats helpful robert e sanchez  ryder system inc thank you art a garcia  ryder system inc thank you operator and well take a followup question from ben hartford with baird ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc hi thanks since we havent exhausted the used equipment pricing discussion enough yet the us dollar is weakened by almost  yeartodate and globally it seems like endmarkets are generally improving are we near enough given the combination of both particularly that dollar weakness yeartodate where some of the offshoring opportunities with regard to these tractors is beginning to open up and if were not close yet is there a sense as to how much further depreciation of a dollar we need before those export opportunities that window may open back up robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah i think its still hard to tell there was reports of some additional exports to vietnam id say it was pretty concentrated with one oem but beyond that i think obviously dollar going down is good for exports but we havent – and ill let dennis comment if weve seen anything recently in terms of improvement in that export market dennis c cooke  ryder system inc yeah not really we keep looking at it and as weve written assets down we look at whether or not a market like vietnam starts to make sense so the answer ben is were constantly evaluating it but there is no real change at this point in time ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc okay and then a followup for art on the longterm – the raising of the longterm debttoequity target you obviously kept the yearend target the same any reason why not to raise the yearend target in conjunction with the raising of the longterm target and i guess thats one question and then in a related vein when do you expect any decisions to be made as to how quickly you do deploy capital to push you into that longerterm range do you expect that decision during the back half of this year or is that something that as you get through the budgeting process for  and you make a decision toward  or more liquidity or something at that point in time art a garcia  ryder system inc yeah thats it ben so i think our view is the yearend number at  was unchanged is based on the business outlook whats happening were going to as we complete our business plan look out for the next year thats probably when well make some decision as to what do we think leverage is going to do and how we react to that so its more probably a yearend kind of decision ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc and what changed during this quarter to give you confidence to reengage that prior  longerterm target again art a garcia  ryder system inc yeah its a combination of factors as we look at our business metrics how were reviewed by the agencies and the like all that factors into our view as to completing our outlook for a few years as to what we think the metrics are going to do and if we were comfortable raising it back to that target ben j hartford  robert w baird  co inc okay thats great thanks for the time guys operator and well take our last question from scott group with wolfe research scott h group  wolfe research llc hey guys thanks appreciate it so just a last couple things the increase in extensions whats driving that and what does that tell you about the leasing market robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah that – the increase in extensions that you see is a pretty big spike up its primarily one customer that had a significant number of trailers that we extended on that lease so i wouldnt read a lot into that big increase scott h group  wolfe research llc okay good do you by any chance have utilization for rental or demand for rental on a monthly basis including july robert e sanchez  ryder system inc weve got – i know weve got through june we got to – digging it up here scott h group  wolfe research llc and maybe while – go ahead dennis c cooke  ryder system inc scott its – were seeing in july for power is in the  range im sorry robert e sanchez  ryder system inc april may june dennis c cooke  ryder system inc april may june so it was again for power utilization was call it  in april may  and june  and in the  range right now scott h group  wolfe research llc and would you say thats – im guessing it typically falls from june to july robert e sanchez  ryder system inc yeah dennis c cooke  ryder system inc seasonally yes scott h group  wolfe research llc okay and then just last thing – and sorry one more on the gains on sales line can you just help frame how we should think about  so youve done some accelerated depreciation hopefully some more retail versus wholesale next year prices may be stabilizing should we – any kind of initial thoughts on directionally gains on sales losses on sales magnitude of gains on sales for next year any color you have or thoughts robert e sanchez  ryder system inc scott theres still a lot to play out this year but i would if you just think about what we see right now assuming uvs doesnt take another big step down or do anything different i would say you probably want to plan for kind of a neutral uvs yearoveryear were going to have some additional headwinds in depreciation we talked about insurance premiums also being a headwind next year but then the offsets are really the growth in the contractual businesses the rental we expect rental – while theres not a big dropoff in demand again rental should be a positive yearoveryear and then obviously cost takeouts as we do every year i think thats going to be – those are going to be generally the positives in the puts and takes and again uvs is still a lot to play out so its early to really start to put a stake in the ground but well see that play out over the balance of the year weve got a lot of work to do over the balance of the year too scott h group  wolfe research llc thats all very helpful and just so im clear youre saying neutral yearoveryear including this years accelerated depreciation or are you excluding that dennis c cooke  ryder system inc no we were talking just uvs robert e sanchez  ryder system inc no were talking about just uvs gains scott h group  wolfe research llc okay robert e sanchez  ryder system inc uvs net impact what i would tell you the accelerated depreciation we mentioned it on the last call i think were saying that that could be  or  million additional when you look at  art a garcia  ryder system inc for next year robert e sanchez  ryder system inc for next year yeah scott h group  wolfe research llc okay all right thank you guys appreciate it operator at this time there are no additional questions id like to turn the call back over to mr robert sanchez for closing remarks robert e sanchez  ryder system inc all right well were just past the top of the hour i think hopefully weve got everybodys questions answered and well be out and meeting with several of you im sure over the next few weeks so look forward to seeing you then and stay safe thank you operator this concludes todays call thank

utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our assetbased product lines the variety of debt financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper longterm and mediumterm public and private debt assetbacked securities bank term loans leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and mediumterm public debt our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is impacted by both our shortterm and longterm debt ratings these ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets a significant downgrade of our shortterm debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper and likely require us to rely on alternative funding sources a significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility

repatriate these foreign amounts to fund our us operations we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the public unsecured bond market commercial paper market and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in the public unsecured debt market or the commercial paper market would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all if we cease to have access to

provides useful information to investors operating revenue measures operating revenue operating revenue is defined as total revenue for fms operating revenue ryder system inc or each business segment fms dts dts operating revenue and scs respectively excluding any  fuel and  scs operating revenue subcontracted transportation we believe operating fms ebt as a  of fms revenue provides useful information to investors as we operating revenue use it to evaluate the operating performance of our dts ebt as a  of dts core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at operating revenue the consolidated level for ryder system inc as well scs ebt as a  of scs as for each of our business segments we also use operating revenue segment ebt as a percentage of segment operating revenue for each business segment for the same reason note fms ebt dts ebt and scs ebt our primary measures of segment performance are not nongaap measures fuel we exclude fms dts and scs fuel from the calculation of our operating revenue measures as fuel is an ancillary service that we provide our customers which is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices and the costs are largely a passthrough to our customers resulting in minimal changes in our profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices however profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs subcontracted transportation we also exclude subcontracted transportation from the calculation of our operating revenue measures as these services are also typically a passthrough to our customers and therefore fluctuations result in minimal changes to our profitability while our dts and scs business segments subcontract certain transportation services to third party providers our fms business segment does not engage in subcontracted transportation and therefore this item is not applicable to fms comparable earnings measures comparable earnings before comparable ebt comparable earnings and comparable eps income tax ebt are defined respectively as gaap ebt earnings and comparable earnings eps all from continuing operations excluding  comparable earnings per nonoperating pension costs and  any other diluted common share eps significant items that are not representative of our business operations we believe these comparable earnings measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better yearoveryear comparison of operating performance nonoperating pension costs our comparable earnings measures exclude nonoperating pension costs which include the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement benefit costs we exclude nonoperating pension costs because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business other significant items our comparable earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations these other significant items vary from period to period and in some periods there may be no such significant items in the three and six months periods ended june   we exclude the following other significant items from our comparable earnings measures in this form q  restructuring in the second quarter of  we recorded restructuring credits related to the gains on sale of certain uk facilities  operating tax adjustment in the first quarter of  we recorded a onetime charge of  million related to operating tax expenses that had not been recognized in prior period earnings  pensionrelated adjustments in the second quarter of  it was determined that certain pension benefit improvements made in  were not fully reflected in our projected benefit

provision for income taxes income tax effects of nongaap adjustments are calculated based on the statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which the nongaap adjustments relate   item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued cash flow measures total cash generated we consider total cash generated and free cash flow to free cash flow be important measures of comparative operating performance as our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment total cash generated total cash generated is defined as the sum of  net cash provided by operating activities  net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment  net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment  collections on direct finance leases and  other cash inflows from investing activities we believe total cash generated is an important measure of total cash flows generated from our ongoing business activities free cash flow we refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions from continuing operations as free cash flow we calculate free cash flow as the sum of  net cash provided by operating activities  net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment  net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment  collections on direct finance leases and  other cash inflows from investing activities less  purchases of property and revenue earning equipment we believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited   item
