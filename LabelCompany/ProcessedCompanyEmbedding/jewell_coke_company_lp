coke annually by jewell from january   through  under a new pricing formula id at ¶  the parties based the amended purchase agreement pricing formula on the price of coke sold to arcelormittal cleveland  indiana under the  haverhill coke agreement id at ¶  in the related litigation also before the court arcelormittal cleveland  indiana allege that the new pricing formula in the amended purchase agreement contains an error which is causing them to pay a  premium for jewell coke arcelormittal cleveland inc v jewell coke co lp  wl  nd ohio sept   in that action arcelormittal cleveland  indiana claim that a multiplier in the new pricing formula was inverted — a mistake that the plaintiffs in that suit calculate already cost them  million with a total amount over the life of the contract of more than  billion id arcelormittal cleveland  indiana seek to have the amended purchase agreement reformed or rescinded due to unilateral or mutual mistake id the court denied jewells motion to dismiss in that suit and discovery is currently ongoing id in  defendant arcelormittal usa was ordered by the united states department of justice to sells its facility at sparrows point for antitrust reasons doc  at  at that time sparrows point llc was also a party to the previously discussed amended purchase agreement id in connection with the sale of sparrows point llc plaintiff jewell and defendant arcelormittal usa entered into a letter agreement guaranty agreement in which both jewell and haverhill consented to sparrows points withdrawal from the amended purchase agreement doc  at ¶  as a condition for allowing the withdrawal arcelormittal usa guaranteed the obligations of arcelormittal cleveland  indiana under the amended purchase agreement id at ¶¶  the guaranty agreement currently remains in force on september   jewell filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment ruling that in the event that the amended purchase agreement between jewell and arcelormittal cleveland  indiana is reformed or rescinded that arcelormittal usa is still required to guarantee payment under the amended purchase agreements original terms doc  at ¶  jewell also brings a claim of negligent misrepresentation alleging that arcelormittal usa was aware that arcelormittal cleveland  indiana believed that the amended purchase agreement contained a mistake in  when the guaranty agreement was signed and that the defendant purposely withheld this information from jewell id at ¶¶  the defendant arcelormittal usa says that this court should dismiss this action under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted specifically the defendant argues that  the guaranty agreement specifically prohibits jewell from bringing the current suit  the declaratory judgment claim does not currently present a justiciable case or controversy and  the negligent misrepresentation claim fails to state a valid cause of action doc  at   ii

atlantic v twombly  us    the plausibility requirement is not a probability requirement but requires more than a sheer possibility that the defendant has acted unlawfully id federal rule of civil

conclusions iqbal  s ct at  citations removed in deciding a motion to dismiss under rule b a court should assume the veracity of wellpleaded factual allegations but need not accept a plaintiffs conclusory allegations as true iqbal  s ct at  iii analysis iiia declaratory judgment the defendant makes two related arguments for why the plaintiffs cause of action seeking a declaratory judgment must be dismissed first the defendant says that the court should dismiss this action since the guaranty agreement specifically prohibits jewell from bringing the current suit doc  at  second the defendant says that the declaratory judgment claim does not currently present a justiciable case or controversy because it is not yet ripe id at  the court finds both of these arguments persuasive and grants the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs declaratory judgment action without prejudice i suit barred by contractual provision first on the contract issue the court finds that the guaranty agreement specifically prohibits suit until there is a default on the underlying obligation section  of the guaranty agreement reads notwithstanding any other provisions in this guaranty no action shall commence against the guarantor unless and until written notice of default is first made upon the applicable guarantors affiliate and guarantor pursuant to the requirements set forth in the haverhill contract or as applicable the jewell contract and such guarantors affiliate or the guarantor fails to cure such default within the applicable cure period doc  at  issues of contract interpretation are generally matters of law and therefore are suitable for disposition on a motion to dismiss pb americas v continental cas co  fsuppd   sdny  quotation omitted the interpretation of a contract of suretyship is governed by the same standards which govern the interpretation of contracts in general general authority for supply commodities cairo egypt v insurance co of na  fsupp  sdny  citing general phoenix corp v cabot  ned   ny  additionally it is a basic contract principle that when the parties set down their agreement in a clear complete document that their writing should be enforced according to its terms vermont teddy bear co inc v  madison realty co  ned   ny  the plain language of the guaranty agreement prohibits suit against the guarantor arcelormittal usa until written notice of default is first made upon the applicable guarantors affiliate doc  at  however no allegation is made by jewell that arcelormittal cleveland  indiana defaulted on the underlying obligation or that any sort of written notice was given to those companies indeed jewell admits in its complaint that arcelormittal cleveland  indiana have continued to pay under the jewell coke supply agreement and have not refused the shipments of coke by jewell doc  at ¶  the plaintiff attempts to circumvent this provision of the contract by saying that the provision does not apply to this action because jewell does not sue to enforce the defendants liability to pay any amount owed rather jewell seeks a declaration of the defendants obligations under the guaranty doc  at  however this argument is belied by the plain language of the contract which states that no action shall commence    unless and until written notice of default is first made doc  at  a suit for declaratory judgment is an action that will determine legal rights and obligations under the guaranty agreement and any natural reading of this provision would include a declaratory judgment action within its reach essentially jewell is improperly attempting to amend this provision to read that only actions brought specifically to collect on the guaranty are limited the court rejects this position since the plain language of this contract prohibits suit against the defendant until there is a default on the amended purchase agreement this action is premature pursuant to the contract this action may be appropriately be filed at a later date therefore the court finds that the plaintiffs claim seeking a declaratory judgment should be dismissed without prejudice ii actual case or controversy although this cause of action is disposed of by the finding that the plain terms of the contract bars suit the court will also consider the defendants argument that this suit is not yet ripe federal courts may only adjudicate actual cases and controversies us const art iii §  this constitutional limitation applies to cases brought under the declaratory judgment act aetna life ins co v haworth  us     usc §  under article iii of the constitution a suit is not a justiciable case or controversy if it is not yet ripe ripeness is a question of timing city communications inc v detroit  fd   th cir  and a claim is not amenable to judicial process when it is filed too early sch dist v secy of the united states dept of educ  fd   th cir  citations omitted when a controversy depends on a future or contingent event a court must carefully analyze whether the dispute is ripe to determine whether an action is ripe courts in the sixth circuit consider  the likelihood that the alleged harm will come to pass  whether the factual record is sufficiently developed to produce a fair adjudication on the merits and  the hardship to the parties if judgment is withheld until after the harm occurs adult video assn v united states doj  fd   th cir  the court will consider each of these factors in turn on the first factor the court finds that the particular harm alleged is speculative at best although arcelormittal cleveland  indiana have challenged their obligation to pay the amount owed under the amended purchase agreement those parties have continued to pay under the agreement and have not given any indication that a default is likely doc  at ¶  moreover the alleged harm — the failure to pay on the amended purchase agreement as currently written — is entirely contingent upon the outcome of the pending litigation in arcelormittal cleveland inc v jewell coke co lp no cv nd ohio thus for the harm to materialize defendant jewell must first be unsuccessful in that suit a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated or indeed may not occur at all wignet v jp morgan chase bank na  fd   th cir  citing cooley v granholm  fd   th cir  therefore the court finds that this factor weighs in favor of finding that the action is not yet fit for review beck v gannett satellite informational network inc  fed appx   th cir  the court finds that the second factor — whether the factual records is sufficiently developed to produce a fair adjudication on the merits — weighs slightly in favor of the plaintiff this suit will largely turn on the intent of the parties in drafting the guaranty agreement specifically whether arcelormittal usa must guaranty the original terms of the amended purchase agreement even if the amended purchase agreement is reformed or rescinded doc  at  doc  at  the factual record likely could be developed if this claim proceeded to allow the court to make these determinations the third factor — the hardship to the parties if judgment is withheld until after the harm occurs — weighs in favor of the defendant jewell alleges that its business operations will be jeopardized should there be any gap in payment on the amended purchase agreement doc  at  however this harm is speculative indeed the plaintiff will suffer no harm unless they are unsuccessful in the underlying lawsuit the plaintiff is really alleging that they are faced with great uncertainty because arcelormittal cleveland  indiana may in the future default on the amended purchase agreement nebraska pub power dist v midamerican energy co  fd   th cir  stating harm may validly include uncertainty in this case however the uncertainty does not rise to the level of undue hardship see norton v ashcroft  fd   th cir  specifically under the express terms of the guaranty agreement the plaintiff contractually agreed not to bring suit to enforce payment against arcelormittal usa until a notice of default is first filed doc  at  thus at all times under this contract jewell faced the risk of a gap in payment because it agreed not to bring suit until a default occurred the prospect of having to wait for a default before adjudicating rights under the guaranty agreement is not an unexpected risk and is therefore not an undue hardship although jewell undoubtedly prefers to adjudicate its legal rights without waiting for a potentially harmful gap in payment — an insurance policy of sorts — in reality jewell currently faces no greater risk of harm than is normally associated with a longterm business contract the court finds that no irreparable harm or substantial hardship will result should the court delay adjudication of the rights of the parties under the guaranty agreement accordingly after considering whether this action for declaratory judgment is fit for judicial resolution the court finds that the action is not yet ripe first arcelormittal cleveland  indiana did not default or even threaten to default on the underlying contract second the need for judicial resolution of the exact nature of the payment guaranteed by the guaranty agreement is entirely contingent on outcome of other pending litigation and third the plaintiff does not currently face any greater risk of harm than is normally associated with a business contract thus the action is not yet ripe and the court must dismiss the action without prejudice winget  fd at  iiib negligent misrepresentation the plaintiff also asserts a claim alleging that the defendant possessed knowledge in  when the guaranty agreement was signed that arcelormittal cleveland  indiana believed that the underlying amended purchase agreement contained a mistake in its pricing formula doc  at ¶¶  the plaintiff says that the defendant concealed this information inducing the plaintiff to enter into the guaranty agreement id as a preliminary matter the parties agree that new york state law controls with respect to the guaranty agreement doc  at ¶  doc  at  doc  at  the guaranty agreement provides that this guaranty and the rights and obligations of haverhill jewell and guarantor shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the state of new york    doc  at  although the parties agree that new york law should apply to the claim of negligent misrepresentation the language of the contract does not necessarily suggest such a broad construction when a court exercises diversity or supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims the choiceoflaw rules of the forum state    govern the determination whether to enforce the    selection of    law wallace hardware co v abrams  fd   th cir  citing klaxon co v stentor elec mfg co  us   banek inc v yogurt ventures usa inc  fd   th cir  in this case the forum state is ohio so ohio choice of law rules govern in deciding whether this court will apply new york law as per the choice of law provision in the guaranty agreement the ohio supreme court has adopted the restatement second of conflict of laws which provides the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue unless either a the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties choice or b application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which under the rule of §  would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties telesave merch co  fd at  in this case the restatement factors favor the application of the parties choice of law provision applying new york law would not be adverse or repugnant to ohio public policy and ohio does not have a materially greater interest in this suit than does new york having determined that the choice of law provision is valid the court must now turn to determining the provisions precise scope the sixth circuit has held that similar provisions apply not only to claims arising under a contract but also to related tort claims in banek inc v yogurt ventures usa inc the sixth circuit held that a choice of law provision which stated that georgia law was to govern all rights and obligations pertaining to a franchise agreement was sufficiently broad so as to cover the plaintiffs fraud and misrepresentation claims as well  fd   th cir  the court based its holding on the fact that the fraud and misrepresentation claims were directly and not tangentially related to the franchise agreement id similarly in baumgardner v bimbo food bakeries distribution inc  fsuppd  nd ohio  the court held that a choice of law provision which stated that the validity performance and interpretation of this agreement shall be controlled and construed in accordance with the laws of new york was broad enough to apply to claims of tortious interference with contract and unjust enrichment  f supp d at  the court in baumgardner noted that while these tort claims were not explicitly covered by the contract they were nevertheless not tangential but rather closely related to performance of the agreement id at  see also moses v bus card express inc  fd   th cir  holding choice of law provision applicable to fraud and misrepresentation claims when plaintiffs were not asserting claims that arose incidentally of the contractual relationship but rather claims that put the validity of the contract in issue in the instant case the plaintiffs claim of negligent misrepresentation is not explicitly covered by the choice of law provision but it is closely related to the performance and underlying negotiation of the contract therefore the court finds that this claim is subject to the parties choice of law provision and as a result the court will apply new york law to the claim proceeding to the merits the plaintiff alleges that the defendant possessed knowledge in  when the guaranty agreement was signed that arcelormittal cleveland  indiana believed the underlying amended purchase agreement contained a mistake in its pricing formula doc  at ¶¶  the plaintiff says that the defendant concealed this information inducing the plaintiff to enter into the guaranty agreement and causing resultant damages id the defendant argues that the court should dismiss the plaintiffs claim of negligent misrepresentation under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the applicable new york law doc  at  under new york law the elements for a negligent misrepresentation claim are that  the defendant had a duty as a result of a special relationship to give correct information  the defendant made a false representation that he or she should have known was incorrect  the information supplied in the representation was known by the defendant to be desired by the plaintiff for a serious purpose  the plaintiff intended to rely and act upon it and  the plaintiff reasonably relied on it to his or her detriment hydro investors inc v trafalgar power inc  fd   d cir  under the first element of the cause of action a party must demonstrate that the person making the misrepresentation possessed specialized or unique experience or the persons involved are in a special relationship of confidence and trust such that reliance on the negligent misrepresentation is justified salesian socy inc v nutmeg partners ltd  add   ny app div  citing kimmell v schaefer  ned   ny  establishing a special relationship under this element requires showing a fiduciary relationship or some other closer degree of trust beyond an ordinary business relationship see hr project associates inc v city of syracuse  add   ny app div  the plaintiff here does not allege that any special relationship existed between the parties new york courts have consistently held that in the absence of a special relationship an action alleging negligent misrepresentation must be dismissed murphy v kuhn  ned   ny  dallas aerospace inc v cis air corp  fd   d cir  stewart v jackson  nash  fd   d cir  here jewell and arcelormittal usa were commercial parties engaged in an arms length transaction and nothing in the complaint suggests that a special relationship existed between them see eg lasalle bank v citicorp real estate  wl  at  sdny mar  holding that no special relationship existed between a mortgage loan seller and purchaser where duty to provide accurate information about financial status of companies subject to mortgage arose solely from the operative purchase agreement kimmell  ned at  professionals such as lawyers and engineers by virtue of their training and expertise may have special relationships of confidence and trust with their clients and in certain situations we have imposed liability for negligent misrepresentation when they have failed to speak with care the plaintiff alternatively attempts to satisfy this element of the offense by alleging that arcelormittal usa possessed specialized knowledge since it was uniquely situated to attest to what its affiliates would have known of their business affairs doc  at ¶  this argument is not persuasive all that jewell really alleges is that arcelormittal usa possessed superior knowledge of its own internal affairs and the affairs of its affiliates than did jewell however basing a claim of negligent misrepresentation on this sort of knowledge would transform every contract dispute into a negligent misrepresentation claim jp morgan chase bank v winnick  fsuppd   sdny  borrowers will almost always have specialized knowledge of the particulars of their businesses and indeed of the facts underlying any misrepresentations made in support of desired loan    lasalle  wl  at  no duty arose from sellers unique knowledge or access to information about mortgage status accordingly the court finds that the plaintiff fails to plead allegations sufficient to meet the first element of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation the defendant also argues that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege facts that would constitute the fifth element of the claim of negligent misrepresentation — reliance resulting in detriment doc  at  specifically the plaintiff says that there is no reliance because the sale of sparrows point was mandated by court order and that no damages were suffered because there has been no default on the underlying amended purchase agreement the court finds the defendants argument persuasive as to damages as already set forth in this opinion any cause of action that jewell might possess should the underlying amended purchase agreement be reformed or rescinded is premature likewise any claim of detriment arising out of this guaranty agreement is also premature and speculative since the plaintiffs pleadings fail to allege a claim of negligent misrepresentation the plaintiffs claim must be dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted iv conclusion for the foregoing reasons court grants the defendants motion to dismiss and dismisses all claims against the defendant the court dismisses count i declaratory judgment without prejudice the court dismisses count ii negligent misrepresentation with prejudice it is so ordered footnotes  prior to the merger of mittal steel usa and arcelor sa in  arcelormittal cleveland  indianas predecessor companies were isg cleveland and isg indiana harbor however for the sake of simplicity the court refers to these companies as arcelormittal cleveland  indiana both prior to and after the merger which resulted in their current names  the courts iqbal and twombly interpretation of rule b has been correctly criticized as contrary to many of the values underlying the federal rules and that the courts preoccupation with defense costs is misplaced and its belittlement of case management as a way of cabining those costs is unpersuasive arthur miller from conley to twombly to iqbal a double play on the federal rules of civil procedure  duke lj     the court finds that the choiceoflaw provision in the guaranty agreement is valid under ohio choiceoflaw principles telesave merch co v consumers distrib co ltd  fd   th cir the court will apply new york law to the terms of the contract  the court also notes that it leaves the issue of whether it would be justified in declining jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act unresolved  usc §  the declaratory judgment act states that a court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking this declaration  usc §  the supreme court has repeatedly characterized the declaratory judgment act as an enabling act which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant wilton v seven falls co  us    see also scottsdale ins co v flowers  fd   th cir  however since the court already found that this suit must be dismissed because express terms of the contract bar the current suit and because the suit is not yet ripe the court need not decide this issue  the court need not decide the reliance issue since the plaintiffs claim already fails to state this element due to a lack of damages comment your

restated and amended coke supply agreement the amended purchase agreement doc  at  the amended purchase agreement extended the original  agreement through  additionally the parties also contracted for the sale of  tons of coke annually from january   through  under a new pricing formula doc  at  the parties based their amended purchase agreement pricing formula on the price of coke sold to arcelormittal under the  haverhill coke agreement doc  at  the plaintiffs allege that the pricing formula for coke in the amended purchase agreement contains an error doc  one component of the sale price for the jewell coke is a coal cost per ton of coke figure the coal cost per ton of coke for jewell coke is calculated in the amended purchase agreement by multiplying the current months coal cost per ton for haverhill coke by a multiplier the pricing multiplier or jewell multiplier is calculated by dividing the weighted average of the coal cost per ton of coke actually paid in haverhill coke agreement during  by the sum of another calculation doc  at ¶ doc  at  thus in the amended purchase agreement the  weighted average of haverhill coke is in the numerator of the jewell multiplier doc  at  the product of this calculation is the coal cost per ton for jewell coke which is used to calculate the total sale price of jewell coke in the amended purchase agreement the plaintiffs allege however that the haverhill coal cost per ton of coke  weighted average is actually supposed to be in the denominator of the jewell multiplier and that the multiplier was inverted during the drafting process doc  at ¶  because of the inversion the plaintiffs calculate that they are now paying a  premium for jewell coke over the price of haverhill coke instead of paying a discount—a discount plaintiffs claim should have been part of the contract on january   the allegedly incorrect pricing term for jewell coke went into effect doc  at  the plaintiffs calculate the current total overcharge at  million with the total amount at issue through the remainder of the contract at over  billion id arcelormittal says that during the negotiations of the amended agreement the defendant provided an illustration illustration detailing the pricing formula doc  at  this illustration arguably sought to explain the complex pricing formula in the amended purchase agreement id in the illustration the  weighted average of haverhill coke is placed in the denominator of the jewell multiplier whereas in the actual contract this figure is placed in the numerator of the multiplier doc  at  the plaintiffs allege that the multiplier in the illustration was the actual intent of the parties and that jewell coke was to be purchased at a discount from the haverhill coke doc  at  the defendant however says that the pricing formula in the amended purchase agreement is correct doc  thus this dispute turns on whether the  weighted average of haverhill coke belongs in the numerator or the denominator of the

mutual and unilateral mistake must be dismissed since the plaintiffs do not allege a plausible mistake doc  at  specifically the defendant argues that the plaintiffs fail to allege any facts that substantiate the claim that the pricing formula in the amended purchase agreement is in error and that the jewell coke was supposed to be priced at a discount to haverhill coke doc  at  in contract law a mistake is a belief that is not in accord with the facts restatement second of contracts §  a mistake can be grounds for rescission or reformation of a contract see reilley v richards  ned    galehouse constr co inc v winkler  ned    mason v swartz  ned    here the court is presented with two plausible stories regarding the jewell pricing multiplier the plaintiffs allege that during the course of negotiations with sun the parent company of both jewell and haverhill that sun and the plaintiffs agreed jewell coke would be sold at a discount relative to haverhill coke doc  at ¶  in their complaint the plaintiffs present a narrative of several years of negotiations between arcelormittal and sun that explains why jewell coke was supposed to be discounted in the amended purchase agreement this narrative is adequate to clear the plausibility requirement of iqbal and twombly according to the plaintiffs in july —prior to the initial  contract with jewell for the purchase of coke—the plaintiffs and sun discussed the possibility of building a coke facility in haverhill ohio dedicated solely to the plaintiffs id at ¶  negotiations between the plaintiffs and sun continued for several months in the interim the plaintiffs and jewell reached a separate contract in  for the sale of  tons of jewell coke id at ¶  in december  plaintiff say sun proposed a contract for the sale of  tons of coke per year the contract would maintain the supply of  tons of jewell coke and would augment this total with another  tons annually from the haverhill plant id at ¶  over the course of several meetings in april  the plaintiffs voiced concern about paying the same price for jewell coke as for haverhill coke id at ¶¶   the plaintiffs say that the concern resulted from the claimed lower quality of jewell coke which allegedly has a higher ash content than does haverhill coke id at ¶  based upon these concerns the plaintiffs rejected the combined offer id at ¶  in late  sun and arcelormittal revisited the earlier proposal and the two companies agreed upon a pair of contracts the first contract was for the sale of  tons of coke annually from the proposed haverhill facility id at ¶  the second contract the amended purchase agreement was for  tons of coke annually and was an amendment to the  purchase contract between jewell and arcelormittal the amended purchase agreement retained the  price term through  but then replaced the price term with the disputed pricing formula for the period between  and  id at ¶  thus the result of this negotiation was a pair of related contracts between sun and arcelormittal—the first for the purchase of haverhill coke and the second for the purchase of jewell coke allegedly at a relative discount the plaintiffs present several other reasons beyond high ash content to explain the discount price of jewell coke relative to haverhill coke including  the jewell coke plant is adjacent to captive mines owned and operated by a jewell affiliate while haverhill must obtain its coal on the open market  the haverhill coke is priced at a premium to help recoup the expense of building the new haverhill facility and  haverhills operations are unionized while jewells are not id at ¶¶  in the narrative the plaintiffs also explain why the coal cost per ton of jewell coke was to be based on the haverhill figure since the jewell coke plant received its supply of coal from sunowned captive mines its costs of production are nonpublic and sun refused to disclose these prices during negotiations id at ¶  the parties allegedly decided to use the public market rates paid by the haverhill plant as a costofproduction baseline and then discount the price using the disputed jewell multiplier to account for the lower production costs of the jewell coke id at ¶  the defendant disputes this story claiming that the plaintiffs description of the purpose of the multiplier is simplistic makes little business sense and that the underlying claim that jewell coke was supposed to be discounted is implausible and is not supported by the evidence doc  at  however regardless of whether jewell coke was actually supposed to be discounted under the jewell multiplier the plaintiffs allege sufficient facts in their complaint to support the claim of mistake the plaintiffs allege based upon the negotiations of the contract that jewell coke was supposed to be priced at a discount and that the final amended purchase agreement mistakenly priced jewell coke at a premium thus the plaintiffs plead the circumstances constituting mistake with a sufficient degree of particularity to satisfy the heightened requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b iiib claims of mistake barred due to negligence jewell also says that arcelormittals claims of both unilateral and mutual mistake are barred because arcelormittal negligently failed to earlier discover the allegedly erroneous multiplier doc  at  the defendant argues that ohio contract law precludes a negligent party from recovering based on mistake and that the plaintiffs fail to specifically plead that it was not negligent and that it exercised good faith and fair dealing id at  in determining whether a partys fault will bar recovery due to mistake ohio courts adopted the standard set forth in the second restatement of contracts see state ex rel walker v lancaster city sch dist bd of educ  ohio std   ned    adopting second restatement standard under the restatement a mistaken partys fault in failing to know or discover the facts before making the contract does not bar him from avoidance or reformation  unless his fault amounts to a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing restatement second of contract §  see also general tire inc v mehlfeldt  wl  at  ohio ctapp jun   stating that only gross negligence bars rescission of a contract based on mistake gartrell v gartrell  ohio appd   ned   ohio ctapp  stating that ordinary negligence does not bar rescission of contract based on mistake haven house manor ltd v gabel  wl  at   ohio app lexis  at  ohio app dec   remedy based on mistake not precluded unless fault amounts to a failure to act in good faith thus arcelormittal is correct in stating that something more than ordinary negligence is required under ohio law to bar its claims of mistake doc  at  here arcelormittal particularly alleges facts in their complaint that if accepted as true establish that they were not grossly negligent or acting in bad faith admittedly the plaintiffs will have a difficult time at trial explaining how they did not notice the allegedly inverted jewell multiplier until such a late date indeed by its discovery the alleged mistake was repeated in a december  amendment to the amended purchase agreement a  guaranty agreement and was used to calculate the payment of several invoices doc  at  but for the purposes of a motion to dismiss arcelormittals claim that it did not notice the mistake despite acting at all relevant times in the exercise of due care will suffice id at ¶  arcelormittal says that it did not notice the allegedly inverted pricing formula in the amended purchase agreement because of the illustration provided by the defendant during negotiations the defendant supplied the illustration to explain the disputed pricing formula the illustration reverses the numerator and denominator from the actual contract and arcelormittal claims that it relied upon this formula and did not notice the reversal of the terms in the final amended purchase agreement id at ¶  this pleading satisfies the good faith and fair dealing requirement under ohio law and the court rejects the argument that negligence bars the plaintiffs claims as a matter of law iiic mutual mistake the defendant says that the plaintiffs claim of mutual mistake must be dismissed since the plaintiffs fail to allege a mutual mistake and instead allege only a scriveners error doc  at  defendants further contend that the plaintiffs claim of a scriveners error fails as a matter of law because the error occurred across multiple documents id at  the plaintiffs concede that they plead a scriveners error but state that this is a form of mutual mistake and that multiple occurrences of such mistake does not bar relief as a matter of law doc  at  an erroneous belief as to the contents or effect of a writing that expresses an agreement is  a mistake restatement second of contract §  cmt a it is a mistake where the parties to a contract reach an agreement but then fail to correctly reduce that agreement to writing restatement second of contracts §  ctm a this type of mistake often typographical is generally referred to as a scriveners error the first restatement of contracts explicitly describes this error as one of mutual mistake restatement first of contracts §  restatement second of contracts §  reporters note adopting §  of the first restatement ohio courts have adopted the restatement formulation and a scriveners error is considered a type of mutual mistake see castle v daniels  ohio appd   ned    describing a typographical error as a mutual mistake harvey v harvey  ohio appd   ned    same music v sash  storm inc  wl  at  ohio ctapp mar   same corbin on contracts §  describing various scriveners errors as mutual mistakes under ohio law a mutual mistake can be grounds for either reformation or rescission of a contract a court may reform an instrument where due to mutual mistake the instrument does not express the actual intention of the parties castle  ned at  mason  ned at  a mutual mistake is a proper basis for rescinding a contract when the mistake relates to a material aspect of the parties agreement reilley  ned at  state ex rel walker  ned at  however where the mutual mistake is one of expression as in the case of a scriveners error rescission is generally only appropriate where reformation will not adequately protect the interests of the parties restatement second of contracts §  cmt b to succeed on a claim of mutual mistake a court must find by clear and convincing evidence that the parties were mutually mistaken regarding the contents of the contract stewart v gordon  ohio st   ne    harvey  ned at  swartz  ned at  arcelormittal pleads that  the haverhill coal cost per ton of coke  weighted average was supposed to be in the denominator of the jewell pricing multiplier and  that the multiplier was inverted during the drafting process and then subsequently recopied into a number of different documents doc  at ¶¶  taken as true these allegations make out a prima facie case of mutual mistake further these allegations are pled with sufficient particularity to satisfy the heightened pleading requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b for claims of mistake thus arcelormittal sufficiently pleads mutual mistake and the court denies the defendants motion to dismiss this claim under federal rule of civil procedure b iiid unilateral mistake jewell also requests that the court dismiss the plaintiffs claim of unilateral mistake under federal rule of civil procedure b jewell says that arcelormittal fails to adequately plead the elements of unilateral mistake specifically jewell argues that arcelormittal fails to plead facts alleging that jewell was aware of the error doc  at  a unilateral mistake occurs when one party recognizes the true effect of an agreement while the other does not general tire inc v mehlfeldt  ohio appd   ned    a court may rescind a contract on the basis of a unilateral mistake ohio courts apply section  of the second restatement of contracts to determine whether to rescind a contract due to unilateral mistake faivre v dex corp northeast  ohio appd   ned    thus under ohio law the party seeking rescission must show by clear and convincing evidence  that it made a mistake at the time the contract was entered into  that the mistake had a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that was adverse to the mistaken party and  that the other party knew or should have known of that mistake aviation sales inc v select mobile homes  ohio appd   ned    applying restatement second of contracts §  gartrell  ned at  generally a court will not reform a contract in the case of a unilateral mistake galehouse  ned at  however where the mistake occurred due to a drafting error by one party and the other party knew of the error and took advantage of it the trial court may reform the contract id faivre  ned at  to reform a contract based on unilateral mistake a plaintiff must prove mistake by clear and convincing evidence galehouse  ned at  here arcelormittal pleads the elements of unilateral mistake with a sufficient degree of particularity first arcelormittal pleads that the haverhill coal cost per ton of coke  weighted average was supposed to be in the denominator of the jewell pricing multiplier but that the multiplier was accidentally inverted during the drafting process doc  at ¶¶   second arcelormittal pleads that the inversion resulted in a significant overpayment for jewell coke which potentially could result in over  billion in overpayments over the full term of the contract id at ¶  if true this is undoubtedly a material mistake finally arcelormittal alleges that the defendant knew or should have known of the error the plaintiffs allege that the defendant drafted the contract provided an illustration with the pricing multiplier in an inverted position engaged in negotiations where the discounted price was discussed and agreed upon and then later accepted the steeply inflated payments id at ¶¶      these allegations if taken as true would prove unilateral mistake under ohio law and would justify either reformation or rescission of the contract the allegations also satisfy the heightened pleading requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b for claims of mistake thus the court denies the defendants motion to dismiss this claim under federal rule of civil procedure b iiie unjust enrichment and restitution the defendant also requests that this court dismiss the plaintiffs claim for unjust enrichment count ii because ohio law does not allow recovery under an unjust enrichment theory where an express contract covers the same subject matter doc  at  the defendant says because the jewell multiplier is an express contractual term on point that a claim of unjust enrichment is barred as a matter of law id although ohio law does not permit recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment where an express contract governs randolph v new england mut life ins  fd   th cir ohio law does allow a party to plead unjust enrichment in the alternative when the validity of the contract is in dispute resource title agency inc v morreale real estate services inc  fsuppd   ndohio  stating that under ohio law unjust enrichment may be pled in the alternative where the contract is in dispute cheers sports bar  grill v directv inc  fsuppd   ndohio  same thus since the validity of the amended purchase agreement is in dispute arcelormittal may validly plead unjust enrichment to succeed on a claim for unjust enrichment a plaintiff must prove  that a benefit was conferred by the plaintiff on the defendant  the defendants knowledge of the benefit and  the improper retention of the benefit cheers  fsuppd at  citing metz v am elec power co  ohio appd   ned   arcelormittal says  that payments were made under the allegedly erroneous pricing formula resulting in a  million overpayment  that jewell had reason to know of the error since it inserted the mistake into the amended purchase agreement and  that jewell retained the overpayments doc  at ¶¶   taken as true these allegations make out a prima facie case of unjust enrichment accordingly arcelormittal sufficiently pleads a claim for unjust enrichment and the court denies the defendants motion to dismiss this claim under federal rule of civil procedure b iv conclusion for the foregoing reasons the court denies the defendants motion to dismiss it is so ordered footnotes  in december  the parties amended the coke purchase agreement again this final amended agreement made minor changes to the amended purchase agreement and also contains the disputed coke pricing formula doc  at   the actual formula for the jewell multiplier in the amended purchase agreement is the weighted average of the coal cost per ton of coke from january   through december   as determined in accordance with the haverhill agreement ÷ the initial coke price in effect as of december  —fixed cost per ton of coke  variable cost per ton of coke doc  at   as a math refresher the numerator of a fraction is the upper portion and the denominator is the bottom portion thus in the fraction  the three is the numerator and the four is the denominator  the court also rejects the defendants argument that arcelormittal should be equitably barred from bringing its mistake claims due to unreasonable delay in bringing suit doc  at  the claims of mutual and unilateral mistake were brought within the applicable statute of limitations and a determination of whether the delay was reasonable is a factual matter not yet ripe for determination ohio revised code §§    §  reformation for mutual mistake except as stated in §§  and  where both parties have an identical intention as to the terms to be embodied in a proposed written conveyance assignment contract or discharge and a writing executed by them is materially at variance with that intention either party can get a decree that the writing shall be reformed so that it shall express the intention of the parties if innocent third persons will not be unfairly affected thereby restatement first of contracts §   it is not necessary for the court to decide at this juncture whether reformation or rescission would be most appropriate  jewell argues that where a scriveners error is repeated across multiple documents that the claim must be dismissed as a matter of law however there is no rule precluding a suit based on mistake where the error is repetitious in nature the only support for this point cited by the defendant is an ohio appellate decision affirming a trial courts ruling that a scriveners error is unlikely to be replicated in three different deeds see zwaryz v wiley  wl  at  ohio ctapp aug   although an error is more likely to occur in a single document it does not preclude arcelormittal from pleading a repeated scriveners error  §  when mistake of one party makes a contract voidable where a mistake of one party at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which he made the contract has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to him the contract is voidable by him if he does not bear the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in §  and a the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable or b the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake restatement second of contracts §   the defendant also argues that the claim of unilateral mistake should be dismissed since the plaintiffs fail to show that jewell bore the risk of such mistake doc  at  however this argument misstates the law of unilateral mistake under the second restatement of contracts a party who bears the risk of mistake is barred from recovering for unilateral mistake restatement second of contracts §  ohio courts have applied this exception as an affirmative defense to a claim of mistake see mehlfeldt  wl  at  in re simonin  br   bankrndohio  thus since burden of risk is an affirmative defense it is not necessary for arcelormittal to plead who bore the risk of mistake comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the
