biotechnology company focused on the advancement of respiratory therapeutics with diseasemodifying potential today announced that the european medicines agency ema has granted the company’s lead product candidate cg an orphan drug designation for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd an orphan drug designation allows products receiving a marketing authorization from the ema to have up to ten years of market exclusivity in the european union eu therabron previously secured an orphan designation for the prevention of bpd from the us food and drug administration fda “orphan designations granted by regulatory bodies like the fda and ema are important because it encourages research and product development for underserved patient populations that can benefit from innovative solutions to otherwise overlooked healthcare conditions we are proud to be recognized for our efforts to help physicians address bpd in premature infants” stated thomas f miller president and chief operating officer at therabron “the orphan designations granted by both the us and eu give significant meaning to the current cg phase  clinical trial currently underway as our experience to date suggests this product candidate has the potential to be a viable therapeutic option to prevent chronic respiratory morbidities that are common in preterm infants” the cg product candidate is a potentially transformative biologic drug that consists of a recombinant human club cell kd protein rhcc a secretory protein that is believed to play an important protective role in the lung via maintenance of airway epithelia and through immunomodulatory mechanisms last year therabron announced the initiation of its second clinical trial in preterm infants which is a phase  study to evaluate cg for the prevention of chronic respiratory morbidities in premature infants this phase  study is supported by a m grant from the fda’s office of orphan product development about therabron

new name therabron therapeutics inc the new name is derived from the words therapy and bronchioles a type of structure in the lungs similar to branches on a tree thus incorporating the company’s mission to develop novel protein therapeutics for the treatment of respiratory diseases “our board of directors decided to change the name to mark the companys escalation into the clinical phase in which multiple clinical trials will be performed” said dr aprile pilon founder and ceo of therabron therapeutics “we think this new name will serve us well as we move forward in developing products to provide longterm improvement in a wide range of respiratory diseases” therabron’s lead product candidate recombinant human cc protein rhcc is a synthetic version of the native cc protein a potent antiinflammatory factor that is deficient in many respiratory diseases rhcc has completed two phase  clinical trials in which it was shown to be safe in infants and adults it showed potent antiinflammatory activity and significant longterm benefit in premature infants who are known to lack sufficient native cc in their lungs therabron is currently conducting a phase  randomized trial of cg rhcc in preterm infants who are at great risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd a chronic lung disease ranging in severity from mild asthma to lifethreatening pulmonary fibrosis the trial is over  percent enrolled and is projected to take another  months to complete enrollment of a total of  very premature infants therabron plans to initiate a second trial for its cg drug

the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome bos  we are pleased to have received orphan drug designation from the ema to treat patients diagnosed with bos following lung transplantation this is an extremely serious and potentially deadly complication of lung transplantation which generally manifests between  months to four years after the procedure the condition is unfortunately refractory to most forms of interventions and therefore represents the most common cause of death for this patient population we believe that cg holds promise as a potentially important therapeutic option and we look forward to working with the ema as we progress clinical development for this indication stated vinzenz ploerer chief executive officer of therabron in addition to cg therabrons lead product candidate cg in development for the prevention of chronic respiratory morbidity crm in premature infants has also been granted orphan drug designation by both the us food  drug administration and the ema  about bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome bos bos is a distinct complication following lung transplantation it leads to fibrosis of airways in transplanted lungs followed by significant functional loss obliteration of the terminal airways and eventually death diagnosis of bos is one of exclusion it is made after other potentially treatable causes of obstructive lung disease have been ruled out such as infection or acute graft rejection in bos the terminal airways become increasingly obstructed eventually being destroyed and lost the onset of bos varies from months to years posttransplant with most patients developing the condition between  months and four years after the procedure regardless the outcome remains universally grim the latest international society of heart and lung transplantation ishlt statistics reflect the lack of meaningful advancement in the survival outcomes for those undergoing lung transplantation with an estimated fiveyear survival of only  making it one of the poorest survival outcomes among all solid organ transplantations performed worldwide today bos remains the most common cause of death in lung transplant recipients who survive beyond the initial posttransplant period slowing the loss of lung function associated with advancing bos could ultimately impact survival time in these patients about european union eu orphan drug designation the european commission grants orphan drug designation status to provide incentives to develop medicinal products to treat prevent or diagnose diseases or conditions that affect no more than five in  persons in the european union the orphan drug designation provides therabron with potential incentives and benefits in the eu including protocol assistance reduced fees and protection from market

designation from the us food and drug administration fda for the prevention of chronic lung disease related to premature birth and has been granted orphan designations by both the us and eu health authorities completion of enrollment in this phase  trial represents the achievement of a significant milestone for therabron and an important step toward evolving the standard of care for preterm infants to our knowledge this is the first interventional phase  trial undertaken to address the issue of neonatal crm a condition for which there is substantial unmet medical need considerable cost of care and currently no available therapeutic options we look forward to completing patient followup continued discussions with the fda and other health agencies and the prospect of advancing cg into phase  clinical development stated dr alan cohen svp and chief medical officer of therabron therapeutics the multicenter randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled doseescalation trial has fully enrolled as planned with  preterm infants between  weeks gestational age who received positive pressure mechanical ventilation for the management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome the trial continues to assess the safety and efficacy of a single intratracheal dose of cg the primary endpoint of interest is infant survival without crm through  months corrected age with specific objectives of  the reduction in respiratory rehospitalizations signs and symptoms of respiratory disease unscheduled doctors visits and use of respiratory medications in cg treated infants vs placebo  the planned unblinding of the phase  trial dataset is expected to occur in mid  this phase  trial was supported in part by a grant from the us fda office of orphan product development about cg cg therabrons intratracheal dosage form of rhcc is a recombinant version of a naturally occurring and highly conserved secretory protein that is believed to play an important protective role in the lung via maintenance and repair of airway epithelia and modulation of inflammation in a large variety of respiratory diseases cg has the potential to improve longterm clinical outcomes in preterm infants and significantly reduce the economic burden beyond the infants inpatient stay in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu about chronic respiratory morbidities in preterm infants more than four million infants are born in the us each year  of these annual live births more than ten percent of newborns are delivered prematurely or before  weeks of gestation  many of these preterm infants require admission to the nicu and critical care management in the first weeks and months of life  preterm infants that survive their nicu stay through discharge are at high risk for development of crm through the first year of life postdischarge these infants typically experience repeated hospitalizations for respiratory complications have persistent coughing and wheezing with the need for numerous respiratory medications and frequent doctor visits throughout their infancy and childhood  additionally these infants are predisposed to longer term potentially lifethreatening respiratory infections and airway disorders such as asthma  an estimated  billion is spent annually in the us on medical issues related to prematurity and the emotional cost to families impacted by having a preterm child is
