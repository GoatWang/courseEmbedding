a highly efficient seawater scrubbing system for marine exhaust gases envimarine™ is a seawater scrubbing system that uses the patented enviclean™ scrubbing head to provide a highly interactive turbulent zone between seawater and the marine exhaust gases the turbulent zone provides the energy and residence time to remove so and a significant portion of particulate matter in a compact and flexible footprint the international maritime organisation and european community have established harmonized regulations in sulphur emission control areas that require lower sulphur emissions as can be delivered by the envimarine™ seawater scrubbing system technical description the envimarine™ system has three areas of interaction – the quench zone the patented turbulent scrubbing head and the pack bed media the system functions by using the natural alkalinity of seawater to absorb so emissions produced by marine engines post treatment discharge of neutralized sulphur into sea using caustic soda naoh as a supplemental reagent when transiting areas with low seawater alkalinity the system has a flexible layout allowing for potential for component separation able to configure footprint to fit space available compact footprint   estimated payback on capital cost aframax   days suezmax   day system operating modes the envimarine™ system is designed to operate in three modes open closed and hybrid depending on the sea’s alkalinity and the effluent emission regulations of the waters in which the ship is located open mode – single pass raw seawater  seawater returned to sea following treatment closed mode – water is recirculated with naoh added to neutralize sulphur no discharge while in port solution is processed and contaminants are stored for disposal ashore hybrid mode –  naoh is added to segments of open system to maintain so removal efficiency in areas of low alkalinity removal efficiency is directly related to thoroughness of interaction and residence time of exhaust gas

designed to remove a broader range of contaminants with very high efficiency as required by waste to energy wte and biomass power plants the envipure™ system is a refined version of the enviclean™ system which has been designed to remove a broader range of contaminants with very high efficiency as required by waste to energy wte and biomass power plants the envipure™ emission system combines the enviclean™ highly effective wet scrubbing technology with an innovative wet electrostatic precipitator wesp and a granular activated carbon absorber to remove particulate matter acid gases regulated metals dioxins and vocs from the flue gas to levels significantly below those required by strictest international regulations with further reductions pending envipure™ offers a longterm solution for use within the waste to energy industry technical description the envipure™ system can be designed to remove up to  of targeted species from waste combustion because of its modular approach envipure™ provides a level of future proofing unavailable to date within the marketplace enhanced approach to pollutant removal captures particulate matter acid gases regulated metals dioxins and vocs in a single pass system reagent management control system minimizes the use of consumables to significantly reduce operating costs design allows the flue gas to transit the entire crosssectional area of the scrubber resulting in a smaller footprint and lower capital cost scrubber footprint can be adjusted to fit the space available making the system an ideal candidate for retrofit applications non hazardous waste water can be processed and reused within the system or for other plant processes such as ash cooling or waste input moisture control multicyclone turbulent wet scrubber and wesp combine to remove particulate to detection limits insuring capacity to meet future regulations with today’s system acid gases are virtually eliminated activated carbon removes dioxins vocs and vapor phase mercury to levels significantly less than the most restrictive regulations each combustorboiler needs to be equipped with its own air pollution abatement system to reduce particulate emission concentrations at the stack to below regional and national air quality standards such as environmental protection agency epa  usa waste incineration directive aka widippc allowable limits for particulate acid gases and other regulated combustion byproducts  uk and eu acid gases the envipure™ system with its multihead turbulent scrubber provides more contact time for more complete removal of acid gases  costs are controlled by using lower cost reagents on the first head while polishing to greater than  efficiency on the second head with more reactive reagents particulate the use of a multicyclone turbulent wet scrubber and wesp in combination provides particulate removal to detection limits  the envipure™ system meets tomorrow’s stricter limits today water use and waste the envipure™ system produces sludge and wastewater that can be used in various ways wastewater is suited for ash quenchingcooling and feed moisture conditioning after dewatering the sludge is suitable for landfill nonstructural concrete stabilization products or combination with bottom ash typical equipment for an envipure™ system includes the following major components a multicyclone for coarse particulate removal an induced draft id fan to provide the flow and pressure boost a gas conditioning chamber gcc for cooling and conditioning of the flue gas a wet scrubber with two heads for highlyinteractive turbulent scrubbing of particulate and acid gases a wet esp for removal of fine particulate to low levels activated carbon adsorber for voc dioxin and vapor phase
