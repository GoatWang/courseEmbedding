frequently asked mortgage questions below what is the difference between preapproval and prequalification the preapproval process is much more complete than prequalification for prequalification the loan officer asks you a few questions and provides you with a prequal letter preapproval includes all the steps of a full approval except for the appraisal and title search preapproval can put you in a better negotiating position much like a cash buyer when does it make sense to refinance usually people refinance to save money either by obtaining a lower interest rate or by reducing the term of the loan refinancing is also a way to convert an adjustable loan to a fixed loan or to consolidate debts the decision to refinance can be difficult since there are several reasons to refinance however if you are looking to save money try this calculation calculate the total cost of the refinance calculate the monthly savings divide the total cost of the refinance  by the monthly savings  this is the break even time if you own the house longer than this you will save money by refinancing since refinancing is a complex topic consult a mortgage professional what is a rate lock a rate lock is a contractual agreement between the lender and buyer there are four components to a rate lock loan program interest rate points and the length of the lock what is the difference between a mortgage broker and a lender a mortgage broker counsels you on the loans available from different wholesalers takes your application and usually processes the loan which involves putting together the complete file of information about your transaction including the credit report appraisal verification of your employment and assets and so on when the file is complete but sometimes sooner the lender underwrites the loan which means deciding whether or not you are an acceptable risk will i save money going directly to a mortgage lender not necessarily in fact if you are a reasonably astute shopper you will probably do better dealing with a mortgage broker mortgage brokers do not add any net cost to the lending process because they perform functions that would otherwise have to be done by employees of the lender furthermore because mortgage brokers deal with multiple lenders  in a typical case  to  sometimes more  they can shop for the best terms available on any given day in addition they can find the lenders who specialize in various market niches that many other lenders avoid such as loans to applicants with poor credit ratings loans to borrowers who do not intend to occupy the property loans with minimal or no down payment and so on what is a full documented loan both income and assets are disclosed and verified and income is used in determining the applicants ability to

verified and must meet an adequacy standard stated assets or no asset verification assets are disclosed but not verified income is disclosed verified and used to qualify the applicant no asset assets are not disclosed but income is disclosed verified and used to qualify the applicant no incomeno assets neither income nor assets are disclosed what is a good faith estimate it is the list of settlement charges that the lender is obliged to provide the borrower within three business days of receiving the loan application what is a conforming loan a loan eligible for purchase by the two

simple steps questions call us at  loan process prequalification mortgage programs and rates the application the loan estimatethe intent to proceedprocessingrequired documents credit reports appraisal basicsunderwritingclosing disclosureclosingsummationprequalification prequalification starts the loan process once a lender has gathered information about a borrowers income and debts a determination can be made as to how much the borrower can pay for a house since different loan programs can cause different valuations a borrower should get prequalified for each loan type the borrower may qualify forin attempting to approve homebuyers for the type and amount of mortgage they want mortgage companies look at two key factors first the borrowers ability to repay the loan and second the borrowers willingness to repay the loanability to repay the mortgage is verified by your current employment and total income generally speaking mortgage companies prefer for you to have been employed at the same place for at least two years or at least be in the same line of work for a few yearsthe borrowers willingness to repay is determined by examining how the property will be used for instance will you be living there or just renting it out willingness is also closely related to how you have fulfilled previous financial commitments thus the emphasis on the credit report andor your rental payment historyit is important to remember that there are no rules carved in stone each applicant is handled on a casebycase basis so even if you come up a little short in one area your stronger point could make up for the weak one mortgage companies could not stay in business if they did not generate loan business so it is in everyones best interest to see that you qualifyback to topmortgage programs and rates to properly analyze a mortgage program the borrower needs to think about how long he plans to keep the loan if you plan to sell the house in a few years an adjustable or balloon loan may make more sense if you plan to keep the house for a longer period a fixed loan may be more suitablewith so many programs from which to choose each with different rates points and fees shopping for a loan can be time consuming and frustrating an experienced mortgage professional can evaluate a borrowers situation and recommend the most suitable mortgage program thus allowing the borrower to make an informed decisionback to topthe application the application is the next step of the loan process with the aid of a mortgage professional the borrower completes the application and provides all requested documentationa loan application is not considered complete until you have given us at least the following information  your name  your income  your social security number and authorization to check your credit  the address of the home you plan to purchase or refinance  an estimate of the homes value and  the loan amount you want to borrowback to topthe loan estimatea loan estimate is a threepage form that you receive after applying for a mortgage the loan estimate tells you important details about the loan you have requested we will deliver this to you with in  days of your fully completed loan application the loan estimate provides you with important information including the estimated interest rate monthly payment and total closing costs for the loan the loan estimate also gives you information about the estimated costs of taxes and insurance and how the interest rate and payments may change in the future in addition the loan estimate will also indicate if the loan has special features that you will want to be aware of like penalties for paying off the loan early a prepayment penalty or increases to the mortgage loan balance even if payments are made on time negative amortization the form uses clear language and is designed to help you better understand the terms of the mortgage loan you’ve applied for all lenders are required to use the same standard loan estimate form this makes it easier for you to compare mortgage loans so that you can choose the one that is right for you when you receive a loan estimate it does not mean that your loan has been approved or denied the loan estimate shows you what loan terms we can offer you if you decide to move forwardback to topthe intent to proceedafter you receive your loan estimate it is up to you to decide whether to move forward with us or not if you decide not to proceed with an application for a particular loan you don’t need to do anything further if you do intend to proceed with us you must take the next step and tell us in writing or by phone that you want to move forward with the application for that loan all lenders are required to honor the terms of the loan estimate for  business days so if you decide to move forward more than  business days after you receive a loan estimate please realize that market conditions may make it necessary to revise the terms and estimated costs and provide you with a revised loan estimateback to topprocessing once the application has been submitted the processing of the mortgage begins the processor orders the credit report appraisal and title report the information on the application such as bank deposits and payment histories are then verified any credit derogatories such as late payments collections andor judgments require a written explanation the processor examines the appraisal and title report checking for property issues that may require further investigation the entire mortgage package is then put together for submission to

addition to the above documents to provide a copy of your first mortgage note and deed of trust these items will normally be found in your mortgage closing documentsback to topcredit reports most people applying for a home mortgage need not worry about the effects of their credit history during the mortgage process however you can be better prepared if you get a copy of your credit report before you apply for your mortgage that way you can take steps to correct any negatives before making your applicationa credit profile refers to a consumer credit file which is made up of various consumer credit reporting agencies it is a picture of how you paid back the companies you have borrowed money from or how you have met other financial obligations there are five categories of information on a credit profileidentifying informationemployment informationcredit informationpublic record informationinquiriesnot included on your credit profile is race religion health driving record criminal record political preference or incomeif you have had credit problems be prepared to discuss them honestly with a mortgage professional who will assist you in writing your letter of explanation knowledgeable mortgage professionals know there can be legitimate reasons for credit problems such as unemployment illness or other financial difficulties if you had problems that have been corrected reestablishment of credit and your payments have been on time for a year or more your credit may be considered satisfactorythe mortgage industry tends to create its own language and credit rating is no different bc mortgage lending gets its name from the grading of ones credit based on such things as payment history amount of debt payments bankruptcies equity position credit scores etc credit scoring is a statistical method of assessing the credit risk of a mortgage application the score looks at the following items past delinquencies derogatory payment behavior current debt levels length of credit history types of credit and number of inquiresby now most people have heard of credit scoring the most common score now the most common terminology for credit scoring is called the fico score this score was developed by fair isaac  company inc for the three main credit bureaus equifax beacon experian formerly trw and empirica transunionfico scores are simply repository scores meaning they only consider the information contained in a persons credit file they do not consider a persons income savings or down payment amount credit scores are based on five factors  of the score is based on payment history  on the amount owed  on how long you have had credit  percent on new credit being sought and  on the types of credit you have the scores are useful in directing applications to specific loan programs and to set levels of underwriting such as streamline traditional or second review however they are not the final word regarding the type of program you will qualify for or your interest ratemany people in the mortgage business are skeptical about the accuracy of fico scores scoring has only been an integral part of the mortgage process for the past few years since  however the fico scores have been used since the late s by retail merchants credit card companies insurance companies and banks for consumer lending the data from large scoring projects such as large mortgage portfolios demonstrate their predictive quality and that the scores do workthe following items are some of the ways that you can improve your credit scorepay your bills on timekeep balances low on credit cardslimit your credit accounts to what you really need accounts that are no longer needed should be formally cancelled since zero balance accounts can still count against youcheck that your credit report information is accuratebe conservative in applying for credit and make sure that your credit is only checked when necessarya borrower with a score of  and above is considered an a borrower a loan with this score will be put through an automated basic computerized underwriting system and be completed within minutes borrowers in this category qualify for the lowest interest rates and their loan can close in a couple of daysa score below  but above  may indicate underwriters will take a closer look in determining potential risk supplemental documentation may be required before final approval borrowers with this credit score may still obtain a pricing but the loan may take several days longer to closeborrowers with credit scores below  are not normally locked into the best rate and terms offered this loan type usually goes to subprime lenders the loan terms and conditions are less attractive with these loan types and more time is needed to find the borrower the best ratesall things being equal when you have derogatory credit all of the other aspects of the loan need to be in order equity stability income documentation assets etc play a larger role in the approval decision various combinations are allowed when determining your grade but the worstcase scenario will push your grade to a lower credit grade late mortgage payments and bankruptciesforeclosures are the most important credit patterns such as a high number of recent inquiries or more than a few outstanding loans may signal a problem since an indication of a willingness to pay is important several late payments in the same time period is better than random latesback to topappraisal basicsan appraisal of real estate is the valuation of the rights of ownership the appraiser must define the rights to be appraised the appraiser does not create value the appraiser interprets the market to arrive at a value estimate as the appraiser compiles data pertinent to a report consideration must be given to the site and amenities as well as the physical condition of the property considerable research and collection of data must be completed prior to the appraiser arriving at a final opinion of valueusing three common approaches which are all derived from the market derives the opinion or estimate of value the first approach to value is the cost approach this method derives what it would cost to replace the existing improvements as of the date of the appraisal less any physical deterioration functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence the second method is the comparison approach which uses other bench mark properties comps of similar size quality and location that have recently sold to determine value the income approach is used in the appraisal of rental properties and has little use in the valuation of single family dwellings this approach provides an objective estimate of what a prudent investor would pay based on the net income the property producesback to topunderwritingonce the processor has put together a complete package with all verifications and documentation the file is sent to the lender the underwriter is responsible for determining whether the package is deemed an acceptable loan if more information is needed the loan is put into suspense and the borrower is contacted to supply more information andor

curriculumseries information synopsis what is truth philosophical explorations have merely presupposed truth rather than define it the inscrutable nature of truth is a recognition of human finitude which is both socratic the recognition that one does not know and nonsocratic the recognition that truth has to be given from without this opens the way to locating truth outside the individual which can be appropriated only when the condition to recognize it is given for kierkegaard the incarnation of christ is the point when both revelation and the condition to recognize it are given however incarnation being historical raises the question of objectivity and evidence this book explores what truth implies for the individual and examines the value of historical research for christian faith endorsements john admirably balances the claims of rational truth and historical experience through a close reading of kierkegaard in doing so he has successfully reoriented christian apologetics to a postcolonial mission in an asian turn to apologetics he contrasts western intellectual and spiritual hubris with the humility of the devout idolater rendering the cultural crossroad of india contemporary with the new testament richard nelson author of aesthetic frontiers a big part of the challenge varughese john takes on in the present volume is to sort out the various aspects of confusion over subjective truth to my mind he carries off the investigation very well what fascinates me especially about professor johns approach moreover is the way he draws upon key aspects of the classical and contemporary traditions of india up to now the names of figures such as ram nuj and amartya sen for example have appeared all too rarely on the pages of discussions of kierkegaards works but with this study as a model one may hope that they will appear more and more frequently in the future from the foreword by andrew j burgess professor of philosophy university of new mexico concerned with the vital question of the nature of truth from a christian perspective truth and subjectivity history and faith represents a significant dialogue with kierkegaards thought at the intersection of eastern and western culture hindu thought and christian faith the result is a careful and illuminating exposition of kierkegaards thought and its relevance in an indian context    this book marks a significant moment in the widening impact of kierkegaard studies around the world and the intercultural engagement of christian theology with other religions myron bradley penner
