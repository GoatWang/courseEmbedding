if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and

accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements      contents   magnalab inc and subsidiary notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited note   basis of presentation and consolidation the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx for smaller reporting companies and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap”  the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of magnalab inc and its wholly owned subsidiary cardiac mri inc collectively the “company” and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation  all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation have been included  these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more complete information and the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended february    the operating results for the three and nine months ended november   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending february   note   discussion of the companys activities and going concern consideration company activities  the company is focused on engaging in a “reverse merger” transaction with an unrelated business that would benefit from the company’s public reporting status  additional activities have included preserving cash making settlements with creditors attempting to raise capital and continuing the company’s public reporting the company was previously engaged in research development and commercialization activities until it ceased such activities during the period september  through march   the company’s efforts to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic arrangement in order to complete commercialization of its cardiac diagnostic illuminator products and development of its artery view product or to seek other means to realize value through sale license or otherwise have been unsuccessful going concern consideration  as indicated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements at november   the company had approximately  of cash and approximately  in negative working capital and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations  for the nine months ended november   the company had a net loss of approximately  and utilized approximately  of cash in operating activities  further losses are continuing subsequent to november    these factors among others indicate that the company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on march    the company’s plans to deal with this uncertainty are described above in “company activities”  management’s plans to raise capital enter into a strategic arrangement or sell or merge with an unrelated business have not been successful to date and there can be no assurance that management’s plans can be realized at all  while a shareholder provided the company with additional loans subsequent to november   note  such amounts are not sufficient to continue operations for the coming twelve months and the company has no commitment for further financing  these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern  no adjustments have been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities which could result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern note  – net loss per common share the company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of us gaap with respect to computing its net loss per common share  net loss per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of class a common and class b common shares outstanding basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period  diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity  since there are no options warrants or derivative securities outstanding basic and diluted loss per share were the same for the three and nine month periods ended november   and       contents   note  – notes payable – related party notes payable include  unsecured notes payable to the company’s principal stockholder magna acquisition llc “mallc” in the aggregate principal amount of  plus approximately  of interest accrued  such notes become due  days after issuance and as such approximately  principal amount of such notes are overdue at november    the notes that are overdue bear interest at  per year subsequent to their maturity date on june   mallc loaned an additional  to the company on the same terms as above the company intends to make a proposal to this principal stockholder to convert all amounts outstanding to them including overdue amounts into common stock of the company subsequent to november   mallc loaned the company an additional  note  – accounts payable and accruals approximately  of accounts payable relates to intellectual property counsel fees and costs including approximately  of which that has been paid by and is therefore due to the company’s chairman and president for payments he has made on the company’s behalf to preserve certain intellectual property rights this officer ceased making such payments several years ago and as such the underlying intellectual property became compromised accrued expenses and other current liabilities includes approximately  payable to a third party guaranteed by our principal stockholder for amounts paid to an account payable in october  on our behalf  this amount was repayable if the proposed merger transaction with this party was not completed  this party subsequently merged with a third party and abandoned its possible transaction with the company however there has not been a demand for repayment of this amount   the company believes it would be entitled to an offset for recovery of certain costs from this third party associated with that proposed transaction pursuant to understandings between the parties some of the amounts recorded as accounts payable may have passed the statute of limitations for purposes of the vendor seeking recovery of such monies  the company has not undertaken a formal study to evaluate recorded payables past the statute of limitations for purposes of possible writeoff of such payables  see also notes  and  to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended february   for other information on outstanding liabilities and related matters there was no activity in the restructuring accrual for the pre activities during the three and nine months ended november   or   the company periodically adjusts the remaining accrual based on the status of the matters and activity given the passage of time note  – stockbased compensation in accordance with gaap the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards  stock awards to consultants and other nonemployees are accounted for based on an estimate of their fair value at the time of grant  the fair value of each option or warrant grant under gaap is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes option pricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions risk free interest rate of  no dividend yield expected option lives of five to nine years and expected volatility in excess of  in april  the board of directors agreed to reserve  shares of class a common stock for issuance to directors and management in the event that their efforts result in board approval of a merger or financing transaction    the criteria for recognition of this share compensation was met on july   and the company recorded stockbased compensation expense of approximately  reflecting the fair value of the  shares at the date of entry into the agreement at the closing bid price of the company’s stock  because of cash constraints the company has not been able to issue such shares  however for accounting purposes the company has accounted for such shares as though they have been issued      contents   note  – effect of recent accounting pronouncements management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements      contents   item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   forward looking statements   some of the statements contained in this report discuss our plans and strategies for our business or state other forwardlooking statements as this term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of   statements that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements  the words anticipate believe estimate expect plan intend should seek will and similar expressions are intended to identify these forwardlooking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying them  these forwardlooking statements reflect the current views of our management  however various risks uncertainties and contingencies could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements   see our form k for the year ended february   for a discussion of certain known risks also see part ii item a overview background and history we are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company  we no longer have any fulltime employees and our chief executive and chief financial officers serve on a parttime consulting basis prior to march  our business had been focused on prerevenue development and commercialization of disposable medical devices designed to enhance the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in detection and diagnosis of heart disease  due to the unavailability of funding beginning in the fall of  we essentially ceased all of our operations including product development and commercialization activities  our efforts to realize value for our prior business and mri technology have been unsuccessful  as a result we view our most viable option to be merging with an unrelated operating company that would benefit from our status as a reporting company in a socalled “reverse merger” transaction  entering into a “reverse merger” would likely involve very substantial dilution to the existing stockholders  it would however provide an opportunity to return some value to stockholders  while we have identified and explored merging with a number of candidates over the past few years and entered into definitive agreements with one candidate which agreement was subsequently terminated we have no commitments to merge with any company at the present time in order to raise cash to continue our efforts to pursue a reverse merger on october   the company consummated a stock purchase agreement with magna acquisition llc “mallc” which resulted in a change of control of our company  under the agreement we sold  shares of class a common stock to mallc for gross proceeds of  before expenses  contemporaneous with the new investment mallc purchased from our former principal stockholder  shares of the company’s class a common stock representing all the shares of our common stock owned by that stockholder  two of our directors and our chief financial officer serve as sole managers of mallc with the ability to vote and dispose of the shares of our company owned by mallc by majority vote  these directors have assumed a lead role with management in pursuing financing and merger candidates and operating matters mallc has been responsible for substantially all of our funding since october   during the period from october  to november   mallc loaned us an aggregate  under a series of promissory notes payable that mature  days from issuance  at november   approximately  face amount of such notes were beyond their maturity date and therefore due on demand  the notes bear interest at  per year increasing to  per year for periods beyond maturity  on june   mallc loaned the company an additional  on the same terms as above  the company intends to make a proposal to mallc to convert all of the amounts outstanding to them including overdue amounts into common stock of the company subsequent to november   mallc loaned the company an additional  while we have reduced our expenditures very significantly we do not have sufficient cash to continue our activities for the coming twelve months  we currently do not have any commitments for new funding      contents   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital resources  at november   the company had approximately   cash and approximately  in negative working capital and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations  for the nine months ended november   the company had a net loss of approximately  and utilized approximately  of cash in operating activities  further losses are continuing subsequent to november    although our principal investor loaned us an additional  subsequent to november   this is not sufficient for our operations for the next twelve months and we have no commitments for future funding  these factors among others indicate that the company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on march    these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern our plan of operations for the coming twelve months is to pursue our “reverse merger” strategy by seeking evaluating and negotiating with merger candidates and to continue to take actions to preserve our cash and continue our public reporting  we do not have the cash resources to continue our plan for the coming twelve months even at our reduced expenditure levels  as such we may have to take further measures or cease activities altogether including terminating our public reporting status we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures results of operations – during the three and nine months ended november   our net loss was approximately  and  respectively compared to a net loss of approximately  and  respectively in the three and nine months ended november    the increase in the loss is due higher consulting and professional costs in  as well as higher interest costs as a result of higher debt levels and higher default interest in the three and nine months ended november   our expenses particularly professional and consulting fees can increase significantly if we are actively engaged in negotiations for a merger transaction or other activities  there can be no assurance that any of our activities will result in any transaction  our interest expenses are increasing with additional outstanding borrowings which are increasingly at default interest rates  off balance sheet arrangements  the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital resources or capital expenditures critical accounting principles – we have identified critical accounting principles that affect our condensed consolidated financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments as well as considering newly adopted principals  they are use of estimates going concern consideration –  our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we are a “going concern”  we are in need of immediate substantial additional capital or a strategic business arrangement in order to continue our planned activities  there can be no assurance that our plans to address this need can be realized   as such we may be unable to continue operations as a going concern  no adjustments have been made in the condensed consolidated financial statements that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income or loss to changes in interest rates foreign exchanges commodity prices equity prices and other market driven rates or prices  we are not presently engaged in any substantive commercial business  accordingly the risks associated with foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices are not significant  our debt obligations contain interest rates that are fixed and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes      contents   item t controls and procedures a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  the company’s senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms  disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   the company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and our chief financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this report  based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective    b  changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules af under the exchange act during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   there are inherent limitations in any system of internal control a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that its objectives are met further the design of a control system must consider that resources are not unlimited and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgment in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls    part ii  other information item a risk factors any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk   some of these many known risks that affect an investment in our company there can be others include     · we have incurred significant net losses in the past and unless we receive additional financing we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our company   · we may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to raise capital and to complete a business combination which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership   · if we merge with an unrelated business we would likely divest of any of our remaining cardiac mri technology partly in connection with or in anticipation of a merger with an unrelated business or such technology may remain with the company and not receive any priority in allocation of any funding that may be available   · if we merge with an unrelated business it is likely that our current officers and directors may resign upon consummation of a business combination   · because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities we may not be able to consummate a business combination with suitable growth potential      contents     · we may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations andor growth of the target business   · we have no full time employees and are substantially dependent on the efforts of parttime management and members of the board of directors working for perdiem or no cash compensation none of whom are bound by term employment agreements and   · our significant stockholders and executive officers and directors currently are able by virtue of their position as managers of magna acquisition llc a

article  of regulation sx for smaller reporting companies and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of magnalab inc and its wholly owned subsidiary cardiac mri inc collectively the “company” and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation have been included these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more complete information and the company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended february   the operating results for the three months ended may   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending february   all dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars   note   discussion of the companys activities and going concern consideration   company activities  the company is focused on engaging in a “reverse merger” transaction with an unrelated business that would benefit from the company’s public reporting status additional activities have included preserving cash making settlements with creditors attempting to raise capital and continuing the company’s public reporting   the company was previously engaged in research development and commercialization activities until it ceased such activities during the period september  through march  the company’s efforts to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic arrangement in order to complete commercialization of its cardiac diagnostic illuminator products and development of its artery view product or to seek other means to realize value through sale license or otherwise have been unsuccessful and therefore in january  the company sold such technology to its president and ceo in exchange for relief from certain liabilities   going concern consideration  as indicated in the accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements at may   the company had approximately  of cash and approximately  in negative working capital and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations for the three months ended may   the company had a net loss of approximately  and utilized approximately  of cash in operating activities further losses are continuing subsequent to may   these factors among others indicate that the company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on march   the company’s plans to deal with this uncertainty are described above in “company activities” management’s plans to raise capital enter into a strategic arrangement or sell or merge with an unrelated business have not been successful to date and there can be no assurance that management’s plans can be realized at all while a shareholder provided the company with an additional loan subsequent to may   note  such amounts are not sufficient to continue operations for the coming twelve months and the company has no commitment for further financing these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern no adjustments have been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities which could result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note  – net loss per common share   the company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of us gaap with respect to computing its net loss per common share net loss per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of class a common and class b common shares outstanding     contents    basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to

additional  to the company on the same terms as above   note  – accounts payable and accruals   accrued expenses and other current liabilities includes approximately  payable to a third party guaranteed by our principal stockholder for amounts paid to an account payable in october  on our behalf this amount is repayable if the proposed merger transaction with this party was not completed this party subsequently merged with a third party and abandoned its possible transaction with the company however there has not been a demand for repayment of this amount the company believes it would be entitled to an offset for recovery of certain costs from this third party associated with that proposed transaction pursuant to understandings between the parties   some of the amounts recorded as accounts payable may have passed the statute of limitations for purposes of the vendor seeking recovery of such monies the company has not undertaken a formal study to evaluate recorded payables past the statute of limitations for purposes of possible writeoff of such payables see also notes  and  to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the company’s annual report on form k

of approximately  reflecting the fair value of the  shares at the date of entry into the agreement at the closing bid price of the company’s stock because of cash constraints the company has not been able to issue such shares however for accounting purposes the company has accounted for such shares as though they have been issued     contents    note  – effect of recent accounting pronouncements   management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements     contents    item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   forward looking statements   some of the statements contained in this report discuss our plans and strategies for our business or state other forwardlooking statements as this term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  statements that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements the words anticipate believe estimate expect plan intend should seek will and similar expressions are intended to identify these forwardlooking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying them these forwardlooking statements reflect the current views of our management however various risks uncertainties and contingencies could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements see our form k for the year ended february   for a discussion of certain known risks also see part ii item a   overview background and history   we are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company we no longer have any fulltime employees and our chief executive and chief financial officers serve on a parttime consulting basis   prior to march  our business had been focused on prerevenue development and commercialization of disposable medical devices designed to enhance the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in detection and diagnosis of heart disease due to the unavailability of funding beginning in the fall of  we essentially ceased all of our operations including product development and commercialization activities our efforts to realize value for our prior business and mri technology have been unsuccessful as a result we view our most viable option to be merging with an unrelated operating company that would benefit from our status as a reporting company in a socalled “reverse merger” transaction entering into a “reverse merger” would likely involve very substantial dilution to the existing stockholders it would however provide an opportunity to return some value to stockholders while we have identified and explored merging with a number of candidates over the past few years and entered into definitive agreements with one candidate which agreement was subsequently terminated we have no commitments to merge with any company at the present time   in january  the company’s president and chief executive officer the “ceo” entered into an asset purchase agreement the “purchase agreement” with the company under the purchase agreement the ceo purchased all of the intellectual property rights any and all physical assets any and all permits and all nonfinancial books records files design specification software and other data related to the company’s magnetic resonance imaging technology in exchange for purchased assets the ceo a assumed all liabilities of the company related exclusively to the purchased assets and b agreed to forgiveness of all indebtedness owing from the company totaling approximately  including intellectual property counsel fees and costs  of which had been paid by and is therefore due to the ceo for payments he has made on the company’s behalf in prior years in an attempt to preserve certain intellectual property rights at that time the ceo ceased making such payments several years ago and as such the underlying intellectual property became compromised   in order to raise cash to continue our efforts to pursue a reverse merger on october   the company consummated a stock purchase agreement with magna acquisition llc “mallc” which resulted in a change of control of our company under the agreement we sold  shares of class a common stock to mallc for gross proceeds of  before expenses contemporaneous with the new investment mallc purchased from our former principal stockholder  shares of the company’s class a common stock representing all the shares of our common stock owned by that stockholder two of our directors and our chief financial officer serve as sole managers of mallc with the ability to vote and dispose of the shares of our company owned by mallc by majority vote these directors have assumed a lead role with management in pursuing financing and merger candidates and operating matters   mallc has been responsible for substantially all of our funding since october  during the period from october  to may   mallc loaned us an aggregate  under a series of promissory notes payable that mature  days from issuance at may   approximately  face amount of such notes were beyond their maturity date and therefore due on demand the notes bear interest at  per year increasing to  per year for periods beyond maturity in june  mallc loaned the company an additional  on the same terms as above the company intends to make a proposal to mallc to convert all of the amounts outstanding to them including overdue amounts into common stock of the company     contents    while we have reduced our expenditures very significantly we do not have sufficient cash to continue our activities for the coming twelve months we currently do not have any commitments for new funding   financial condition liquidity and capital resources  at may   the company had approximately  cash and approximately  in negative working capital and stockholders’ deficit and negative cash flows from operations for the three months ended may   the company had a net loss of approximately  and utilized approximately  of cash in operating activities further losses are continuing subsequent to may   although our principal investor loaned us an additional  in june  this is not sufficient for our operations for the next twelve months and we have no commitments for future funding these factors among others indicate that the company is in need of additional financing or a strategic arrangement in order to continue its planned activities for the fiscal year that began on march   these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue operations as a going concern   our plan of operations for the coming twelve months is to pursue our “reverse merger” strategy by seeking evaluating and negotiating with merger candidates and to continue to take actions to preserve our cash and continue our public reporting we do not have the cash resources to continue our plan for the coming twelve months even at our reduced expenditure levels as such we may have to take further measures or cease activities altogether including terminating our public reporting status   we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures   results of operations – during the three months ended may   our net loss was approximately  compared to a net loss of approximately  in the three months ended may   the increase in the loss is due principally to the higher debt levels and higher default interest in the three months ended may   that resulted in an increase in interest expense as well as certain costs associated with exploring a merger candidate   our expenses particularly professional and consulting fees can increase significantly if we are actively engaged in negotiations for a merger transaction there can be no assurance that any of our activities will result in any transaction our interest expenses are increasing with additional outstanding borrowings which are increasingly at default interest rates    off balance sheet arrangements    the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital resources or capital expenditures   critical accounting principles –   we have identified critical accounting principles that affect our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments as well as considering newly adopted principals they are   going concern consideration – our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we are a “going concern” we are in need of immediate substantial additional capital or a strategic business arrangement in order to continue our planned activities there can be no assurance that our plans to address this need can be realized as such we may be unable to continue operations as a going concern no adjustments have been made in the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern   our other accounting policies which we do not consider critical accounting policies are contained in note  to the consolidated financial statements at february   contained in our form k     contents    item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   market risk is the sensitivity of income or loss to changes in interest rates foreign exchanges commodity prices equity prices and other market driven rates or prices we are not presently engaged in any substantive commercial business accordingly the risks associated with foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices are not significant our debt obligations contain interest rates that are fixed and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes   item t controls and procedures   a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  the company’s senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   the company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and our chief financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective   b changes in internal control over financial reporting there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules af under the exchange act during our most recently completed fiscal quarter which is the subject of this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   there are inherent limitations in any system of internal control a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that its objectives are met further the design of a control system must consider that resources are not unlimited and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgment in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls    part ii  other information   item a risk factors   any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk some of these many known risks that affect an investment in our company there can be others include   ·we have incurred significant net losses in the past and unless we receive additional financing we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our company   ·we may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to raise capital and to complete a business combination which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership   ·if we merge with an unrelated business we would likely divest of any of our remaining cardiac mri technology partly in connection with or in anticipation of a merger with an unrelated business or such technology may remain with the company and not receive any priority in allocation of any funding that may be available     contents    ·if we merge with an unrelated business it is likely that our current officers and directors may resign upon consummation of a business combination   ·because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities we may not be able to consummate a business combination with suitable growth potential   ·we may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations andor growth of the target business   ·we have no full time employees and are substantially dependent on the efforts of parttime management and members of the board of directors working for perdiem or no cash compensation none of whom are bound by term employment agreements and   ·our significant stockholders and executive officers and directors currently are able by virtue of their position as managers of magna acquisition llc a  stockholder of the company to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders   for a more complete listing and description of these and other risks
