title heavenly prince tian wang during his reign of the chinesedi state former qin under whose rule assisted by his able prime minister wang meng the former qin state reached its greatest glory—destroying former yan former liang and dai and seizing jins yi province  modern sichuan and chongqing posturing to destroy jin as well to unite china until he was repelled at the battle of fei river in  for a variety of reasons the former qin state soon collapsed after that defeat and fú jiān himself was killed by his former subordinate yao chang the founding emperor of later qin in  contents  early life  reign with the assistance of wang meng  after wang mengs death  battle of fei river  after the battle of fei river  era names  personal information  references early lifeedit fú jiān was born in  when the family name was still pu  to fu xiong 雄 and his wife lady gou his grandfather pu hong 洪 was a di chieftain and a major general for later zhao serving under the violent emperor shi hu who did however accord pu great respect later during later zhaos collapse pu hong changed his name to fu hong and planned a conquest of the guanzhong region but was poisoned by the general ma qiu  he was succeeded by his son fú jiāns uncle fu jiàn who did advance west and conquer the guanzhong region and the surrounding provinces in this he was ably assisted by fú jiāns father fu xiong whom he created the prince of donghai in  while on a campaign fu xiong died as the son of fu xiongs wife fú jiān inherited the title of prince of donghai even though he had at least one older brother fu fa 法 who was created the prince of qinghe fú jiān developed the reputation of being filial and farsighted as well as being knowledgeable and able as fú jiān grew older he received some military responsibilities under his cousin fu sheng who succeeded fu jiàn after his death in  in  when yao xiang  a major qiang chief attacked former qin hoping to conquer it fú jiān was one of the generals who fought him and defeated him capturing and executing him on the battlefield yao xiangs brother yao chang surrendered initially the lead general fu huangmei 黃眉 the prince of guangping wanted to put yao chang to death but fú jiān interceded and yao chang was spared fu shengs reign was one filled with violence caprice and cruelty as he killed official after official in his administration all of the nobles and officials became fearful of being the next target a number of officials tried to persuade fú jiān to overthrow fu sheng and it was in the planning stages that fú jiān under the introduction of the official lü polou  met wang meng with whom he immediately developed a friendship fú jiān planned to act against fu sheng but hesitated since fu sheng was a powerful warrior however after news leaked that fu sheng had planned to kill fú jiān and his brother fu fa fú jiān and fu fa took immediate action and attacked the palace while fu sheng was in a drunken stupor fu shengs guards surrendered without a fight and fú jiān put fu sheng to death and took over the throne he did not however take imperial title as fu sheng had but claimed the title heavenly prince tian wang he posthumously honored his father fu xiong as an emperor and he honored his mother lady gou as an empress dowager his wife lady gou was created empress reign with the assistance of wang mengedit at the start of fú jiāns reign in addition to wang meng he had several other top advisors—his brothers fu fa and fu rong the duke of yangping his son fu pi the duke of changle and his mother empress dowager gous lover li wei  it was with lis support that wangs position became increasingly important eventually becoming one of prime minister status this was particularly the case when around new year  empress dowager gou apprehensive of fu fas growing authority forced him to commit suicide senior officials mostly of di ethnicity were often jealous of wang but whatever conflict they engaged with wang always resulted in wangs prevailing over them since wang was favored by fú jiān wang with fú jiāns support established rule of law throughout the empire and he even executed the founding emperor fu jiàns honored but corrupt brotherinlaw qiang de  despite fú jiāns desire to pardon qiang it was described that the empire was ruled efficiently and justly during this period fú jiān was also recorded as having the cruel laws of fu shengs reign and the extravagance he also encouraged his officials to recommend talented people for posts and rewarded or punished them based on whether the people they recommended performed their jobs well it was described that former qin officials were therefore all highly competent and responsible in  fú jiān conferred titles on zhang tianxi the nominal jin vassal who was the ruler of former liang making him a former qin vassal as well in late  however zhang tianxi disavowed that status and cut off relations with former qin later in  fu shengs brother fu teng the duke of runan rebelled but was captured and executed wang concerned about four other brothers of fu sheng fu you 幼 the duke of huainan fu liu 柳 the duke of jin fu sou 廋 the duke of wei and fu wu 武 the duke of yan suggested to fú jiān to have all of them killed fú jiān refused late in  fú jiān tried to restore the early jin system by permitting the dukes—his brothers sons and cousins—to commission their own assistants however he cancelled the plans when some of the dukes retained rich merchants to serve as their assistants purely on account of their wealth in  after the former yan regent murong ke captured the important jin city of luoyang he postured as if about to attack former qin fú jiān personally readied his troops to face murong ke but no attack from murong ke actually occurred late in  xiongnu chiefs cao gu  and liu weichen  rebelled together and fú jiān personally attacked them capturing liu and forcing caos surrender—but in the first instance of such actions that would lead to disaster decades later allowed cao and liu to continue to command their troops later that year fu you rebelled but was killed in battle by li who had stayed at the capital changan with fú jiāns crown prince fu hong 宏 note different character than fú jiāns grandfather in  after murong kes death and replacement by the far less capable murong ping fú jiān began plans to conquer former yan he would soon however have to contend with the possibility that his empire would be the one so conquered as in winter of that year fu liu at puban 阪 in modern yuncheng shanxi fu sou at shancheng  in modern sanmenxia henan fu wu at anding  in modern pingliang gansu and fú jiāns brother fu shuang 雙 the duke of zhao at shanggui  in modern tianshui gansu rebelled together offering to submit to former yan and seeking former yan aid however murong ping refused assistance fú jiān sent forces to attack the four rebellious dukes separately fu wu and fu shuang were quickly defeated and killed followed by fu liu and fu sou in  the paramount jin general huan wen launched a major attack against former yan reaching fangtou  in modern hebi henan in the vicinity of former yans capital yecheng in panic former yan sought assistance from former qin promising that if former qin launched troops to assist it would cede the luoyang region to former qin most former qin officials opposed but wang advised fú jiān that he had to make sure that huan would not conquer former yan—because former qin would not be able to stand up to jin if jin destroyed former yan fú jiān thus launched troops which arrived after former yans general murong chui had already dealt huan one defeat but the former qin forces in conjunction with former yan did deal huan another major defeat however former yan reneged on its promise to cede the luoyang region and fú jiān put wang in charge of a men force against former yan wangs campaign seemed even more promising after murong chui fearful of murong pings jealousy and the emperor murong weis mother empress dowager kezuhuns hatred toward him defected to former qin in spring  wang first advanced on luoyang and forced its surrender he then advanced on hu pass  in modern changzhi shanxi defeating all former yan resistance on the way he then captured jinyang  in modern taiyuan shanxi murong ping led a men strong force against wang but apprehensive of wang he stopped at lu river  in modern changzhi as well wang soon arrived to prepare to face off against him meanwhile murong ping made the worst display of his corruption at this time—keeping guards at forests and streams disallowing commoners and even his own soldiers from cutting firewood or fishing unless they paid a usage fee in either money or silk he soon had a stash of wealth but completely lost the morale of his soldiers murong wei hearing this sent a messenger to rebuke him and ordering him to distribute the wealth to the soldiers but the damage was done in winter  the armies engaged and despite the numerical advantage that murong ping had wang crushed him and murong ping fled back to yecheng by himself murong wei abandoned yecheng and tried to flee to the old capital helong  in modern jinzhou liaoning but was captured on the way fú jiān pardoned him but had him formally surrender with his officials ending former yan initially fú jiān put wang meng in charge of all of the conquered former yan territory as viceroy he relocated murong wei and his clan as well as a large number of his xianbei people to the guanzhong region in the heart of former qin in  he summoned wang back to the capital to resume his post as prime minister while putting fu rong in charge of the eastern empire wangs authority was described to be so great that fú jiān himself had little need to worry about the affairs of state fú jiān continued to carry out campaigns that were intended to eventually unite all of china in  he launched a campaign against jins western region conquering modern sichuan chongqing and southern shaanxi meanwhile many former qin officials including wang became concerned about the large number of xianbei people that he placed in the heart of the empire and how many xianbei officials including those of former yans imperial murong clan he put in charge of important posts and they largely urged him to reduce the authority of xianbei officials he refused in  wang became gravely ill and he on his death bed suggested to fú jiān to stop the campaigns against jin while not trusting the xianbei and qiang officials as much as he has done after wang died however fú jiān did not agree with his last words and continued to bestow authority on the xianbei and qiang officials after wang mengs deathedit after wang mengs death fú jiān continued to carry out his campaigns to try to unite the empire these campaigns while largely successful were according to historical resources draining on the resources of the empire and of the people and wore out his troops further fú jiān who was known for thrifty living in his early years began to spend somewhat extravagantly on palace designs further one of wangs focus areas—to keep the governmental officials honest and competent—appeared to have been ignored as one began to see false governmental reports in historical records for example in  former qin suffered a major locust infestation that required a failed extermination effort throughout you  modern beijing tianjin and northern hebei qing  modern central and eastern shandong ji  modern central hebei and bing  modern shanxi provinces—and yet the governmental records paradoxically recorded that these provinces except you province received large yields on their crop fields and that the locusts did not infest the hemp and bean plants a fairly impossible scenario this suggested that government officials were no longer reporting statuses of their provinces honestly but were only making reports that pleased fú jiān and the high level officials this might be because fú jiān after wangs death felt that he had to personally oversee everything and was burdening himself with too many tasks as evidenced in an edict that he issued in  indicating that his workload was burdening him so much that half of his hair turned white in fall  fú jiān launched a major attack against former liang after its ruler zhang tianxi refused to show submission by visiting the former qin capital changan and further killed fú jiāns messengers zhangs generals who were displeased with the young favorites that he had installed in the regime either surrendered or were defeated easily and in less than a month zhang was forced to surrender and former liangs territory modern central and western gansu northern qinghai and eastern xinjiang were annexed to former qin just two months later fú jiān launched another major campaign against dai and in light of the recent assassination of its prince tuoba shiyijian by his son tuoba shijun  conquered it as well although he permitted tuoba shiyijians grandson tuoba gui to remain under the care of tribal chief liu kuren  and be the eventual heir presumptive to the dai throne in  fú jiān sent fu pi murong wei and gou chang  to attack the important jin border city of xiangyang  in modern xiangfan hubei at gous suggestion fu pi ordered that xiangyang be surrounded to force it into submission at minimal losses but fú jiān unhappy at his sons slow pace in capturing the city ordered fu pi to either capture the city by spring  or commit suicide fu pi therefore launched a major assault on the city capturing it in spring  weixing  in modern ankang shaanxi also fell at the same time however another army sent by fú jiān commanded by peng chao  after capturing pengcheng  in modern xuzhou jiangsu was defeated by the jin general xie xuan and forced to abandon pengcheng in  fú jiāns cousin fu luo 洛 the duke of xingtang who felt slighted by not being sufficiently rewarded for his victories against dai in  and believed that fú jiān had worn out his troops rebelled he was however crushed by the general lü guang and captured but fú jiān did not kill him but only exiled him this was heavily criticized by historians who believed that fú jiān by not executing fu luo and several others in similar situations encouraged future rebellions that eventually brought down his empire also in  fú jiān carried out a historically controversial decision to distribute his di people—a small minority in his empire—to various regions of the empire under the command of his sons and other generals he probably intended to have them serve as a stabilizing force throughout the empire but the shortterm result was that the heart of the empire guanzhong was left with few di and filled with xianbei and qiang which would eventually cause a destabilizing effect he also summoned his brother fu rong back to the capital and take over posts previously held by wang meng fu pi replaced fu rong in his responsibilities as viceroy over the eastern empire in late  fú jiān again planned to conquer jin most of the important officials opposed—including the prime minister fu rong however the campaign was supported by murong chui and yao chang and fú jiān became intent to carrying it out and when an official raised the point that the yangtze river was difficult to cross he made the remarks we have so many soldiers that if they threw down their whips it would be enough to stop the flow of the yangtze in  fú jiān sent lü on a campaign to xiyu  modern xinjiang and former soviet central asia where some of the kingdoms had submitted to former qin as vassals but some had not lüs campaign would last several years and be quite successful—but by the time it was complete fú jiān would be dead and former qin would be near destruction battle of fei riveredit main article battle of fei river in  fú jiān launched the campaign under fu rongs command despite fu rongs opposition after initial victories capturing the jin city of shouyang  in modern luan anhui the former qin advance troops would suffer some losses at the hands of xie xuan and liu laozhi  and the armies would be stalemated at the fei river which no longer exists but likely flowed through modern luan near the huai river with the former qin forces to the west of the river and the jin forces to the east xie xuan suggested to fu rong that he retreat west to allow jin forces to cross and fú jiān and fu rong agreed but as the retreat started the former qin forces panicked and could not be stopped fu rong trying to calm the troops suddenly had his horse fall under him and he was killed by jin forces which further led to a complete collapse of former qin forces fú jiān himself was hit by a stray arrow and was forced to flee to murong chui whose army was one of the few that did not collapse murong chuis son murong bao and brother murong de tried to persuade him to kill fú jiān and reestablish yan but murong chui refused escorting fú jiān safely back to luoyang after the battle of fei riveredit murong chui while not willing to resort to murder due to fú jiāns earlier kindness to him did decide however to try to reestablish yan under the pretense of wanting to calm the people of the eastern empire he persuaded fú jiān to allow him to lead an army northeast despite opposition by quan yi  as murong chui arrived at yecheng he and fu pi suspected each other but each ruled out suggestions by their respective subordinates to ambush the other as at this time the dingling chief zhai bin  rebelled against former qin with assistance with murong chuis nephew murong feng  and attacked luoyang and fu pi sent murong chui south to relieve luoyang with the di general fu feilong 飛龍 as his assistant on the way to luoyang murong chui ambushed fu feilong and slaughtered his di soldiers but still wrote an explanation to fú jiān in spring  however murong chui would join zhai and claim the title prince of yan establishing later yan he soon captured many cities in the eastern empire although yecheng and luoyang held out against him meanwhile murong chuis nephew and murong weis brother murong hong upon hearing news of murong chuis uprising gathered some xianbei soldiers and started his own rebellion within guanzhong claiming his old former yan title of prince of jibei and starting western yan fú jiān sent his brother fu rui 叡 the duke of julu assisted by yao chang against murong hong murong hong in fear was about to leave guanzhong and fu rui was intent on cutting off his escape route despite yaos suggestion to let the xianbei leave instead murong hong forced into combat defeated and killed fu rui when yao sent messengers to the capital to report the defeat fú jiān for reasons unknown got so angry that he killed yaos messengers—causing yao to panic and flee with qiang soldiers yao then declared himself the prince of qin of ten thousand years  establishing later qin meanwhile murong hong advanced on changan and he was joined by another brother murong chong he demanded that fú jiān escort murong wei to him and murong wei while pledging allegiance to fú jiān secretly send messengers to murong hong urging him to attack changan although murong hong was then murdered by his own generals and replaced with murong chong who claimed the title of crown prince meanwhile fú jiān himself led an army against yao but was unsuccessful fú jiāns son fu hui 暉 the duke of pingyuan then abandoned luoyang to come to changans aid and all of the eastern empire was lost except for yecheng meanwhile jin also launched campaigns and would recapture the modern chongqing sichuan and southern shaanxi region by early  as well as capturing much of the former qin territory south of the yellow river although jin forces under xie xuan would at times be in temporary alliance with fu pi against later yan as well in late  murong wei tried to kill fú jiān at a feast and after this was discovered fú jiān put him and the other xianbei inside changan to death murong chong upon hearing this news declared himself emperor in early  he would continue to deal fu hui defeats and fu hui in anger over the defeats and fú jiāns rebukes in light of the defeats committed suicide with murong chong surrounding changan changan fell into a terrible famine fú jiān decided that he would lead an army out of the city to try to capture food supplies and he left his crown prince fu hong in charge of the city but as soon as he left the city fell and fu hong fled to jin meanwhile fú jiān himself took his army to wujiang mountain  in modern baoji shaanxi but was surrounded and captured by later qin forces and taken to xinping  in modern xianyang shaanxi and imprisoned there with his concubine consort zhang his son fu shen 詵 the duke of zhongshan and his daughter fu bao 寶 and fu jin 錦 yao chang tried to persuade him to ceremonially pass the throne to him but fú jiān angry at yaos betrayal refused he also killed fu bao and fu jin reasoning that he did not want to let yaos followers humiliate them in fall  yao sent his soldiers to strangle fú jiān consort zhang and fu shen committed suicide even later qin soldiers mourned fú jiān however and yao in order to pretend as if he did not put fú jiān to death posthumously honored him as heavenly prince zhuanglie  although that posthumous name would not be

henan in the vicinity of former yans capital yecheng in panic former yan sought assistance from former qin promising that if former qin launched troops to assist it would cede the luoyang region to former qin most former qin officials opposed but wang advised fú jiān that he had to make sure that huan would not conquer former yan—because former qin would not be able to stand up to jin if jin destroyed former yan fú jiān thus launched troops which arrived after former yans general murong chui had already dealt huan one defeat but the former qin forces in conjunction with former yan did deal huan another major defeat however former yan reneged on its promise to cede the luoyang region and fú jiān put wang in charge of a men force against former yan wangs campaign seemed even more

led a men strong force against wang but apprehensive of wang he stopped at lu river  in modern changzhi as well wang soon arrived to prepare to face off against him meanwhile murong ping made the

either money or silk he soon had a stash of wealth but completely lost the morale of his soldiers murong wei hearing this sent a messenger to rebuke him and ordering him to distribute the wealth to the soldiers but the damage was done in winter  the armies engaged and despite the numerical advantage that murong ping had wang crushed him and murong ping fled back to yecheng by himself murong wei abandoned yecheng and tried to flee to the old capital helong  in modern jinzhou liaoning but was captured on the way fú jiān pardoned him but had him formally surrender with his officials ending former yan initially fú jiān put wang meng in charge of all of the conquered former yan territory as viceroy he relocated murong wei and his clan as well as a large number of his xianbei people to the guanzhong region in the heart of former qin in  he summoned wang back to the capital to resume his post as prime minister while putting fu rong in charge of the eastern empire wangs authority was described to be so great that fú jiān himself had little need to worry about the affairs of state fú jiān continued to carry out campaigns that were intended to eventually unite all of china in  he launched a campaign against jins western region conquering modern sichuan chongqing and southern shaanxi meanwhile many former qin officials including wang became concerned about the large number of xianbei people that he placed in the heart of the empire and how many xianbei officials including those of former yans imperial murong clan he put in charge of important posts and they largely urged him to reduce the authority of xianbei officials he refused in  wang became gravely ill and he on his death bed suggested to fú jiān to stop the campaigns against jin while not trusting the xianbei and qiang officials as much as he has done after wang died however fú jiān did not agree with his last words and continued to bestow authority on the xianbei and qiang officials after wang mengs deathedit after wang mengs death fú jiān continued to carry out his campaigns to try to unite the empire these campaigns while largely successful were according to historical resources draining on the resources of the empire and of the people and wore out his troops further fú jiān who was known for thrifty living in his early years began to spend somewhat extravagantly on palace designs further one of wangs focus areas—to keep the governmental officials honest and competent—appeared to have been ignored as one began to see false governmental reports in historical records for example in  former qin suffered a major locust infestation that required a failed extermination effort throughout you  modern beijing tianjin and northern hebei qing  modern central and eastern shandong ji  modern central hebei and bing  modern shanxi provinces—and yet the governmental records paradoxically recorded that these provinces except you province received large yields on their crop fields and that the locusts did not infest the hemp and bean plants a fairly impossible scenario this suggested that government officials were no longer reporting statuses of their provinces honestly but were only making reports that pleased fú jiān and the high level officials this might be because fú jiān after wangs death felt that he had to personally oversee everything and was burdening himself with too many tasks as evidenced in an edict that he issued in  indicating that his workload was burdening him so much that half of his hair turned white in fall  fú jiān launched a major attack against former liang after its ruler zhang tianxi refused to show submission by visiting the former qin capital changan and further killed fú jiāns messengers zhangs generals who were displeased with the young favorites that he had installed in the regime either surrendered or were defeated easily and in less than a month zhang was forced to surrender and former liangs territory modern central and western gansu northern qinghai and eastern xinjiang were annexed to former qin just two months later fú jiān launched another major campaign against dai and in light of the recent assassination of its prince tuoba shiyijian by his son tuoba shijun  conquered it as well although he permitted tuoba shiyijians grandson tuoba gui to remain under the care of tribal chief liu kuren  and be the eventual heir presumptive to the dai throne in  fú jiān sent fu pi murong wei and gou chang  to attack the important jin border city of xiangyang  in modern xiangfan hubei at gous suggestion fu pi ordered that xiangyang be surrounded to force it into submission at minimal losses but fú jiān unhappy at his sons slow pace in capturing the city ordered fu pi to either capture the city by spring  or commit suicide fu pi therefore launched a major assault on the city capturing it in spring  weixing  in modern ankang shaanxi also fell at the same time however another army sent by fú jiān commanded by peng chao  after capturing pengcheng  in modern xuzhou jiangsu was defeated by the jin general xie xuan and forced to abandon pengcheng in  fú jiāns cousin fu luo 洛 the duke of xingtang who felt slighted by not being sufficiently rewarded for his victories against dai in  and believed that fú jiān had worn out his troops rebelled he was however crushed by the general lü guang and captured but fú jiān did not kill him but only exiled him this was heavily criticized by historians who believed that fú jiān by not executing fu luo and several others in similar situations encouraged future rebellions that eventually brought down his empire also in  fú jiān carried out a historically controversial decision to distribute his di people—a small minority in his empire—to various regions of the empire under the command of his sons and other generals he probably intended to have them serve as a stabilizing force throughout the empire but the shortterm result was that the heart of the empire guanzhong was left with few di and filled with xianbei and qiang which would eventually cause a destabilizing effect he also summoned his brother fu rong back to the capital and take over posts previously held by wang meng fu pi replaced fu rong in his responsibilities as viceroy over the eastern empire in late  fú jiān again planned to conquer jin most of the important officials opposed—including the prime minister fu rong however the campaign was supported by murong chui and yao chang and fú jiān became intent to carrying it out and when an official raised the point that the yangtze river was difficult to cross he made the remarks we have so many soldiers that if they threw down their whips it would be enough to stop the flow of the yangtze in  fú jiān sent lü on a campaign to xiyu  modern xinjiang and former soviet central asia where some of the kingdoms had submitted to former qin as vassals but some had not lüs campaign would last several years and be quite successful—but by the time it was complete fú jiān would be dead and former qin would be near destruction battle of fei riveredit main article battle of fei river in  fú jiān launched the campaign under fu rongs command despite fu rongs opposition after initial victories capturing the jin city of shouyang  in modern luan anhui the former qin advance troops would suffer some losses at the hands of xie xuan and liu laozhi  and the armies would be stalemated at the fei river which no longer exists but likely flowed through modern luan near the huai river with the former qin forces to the west of the river and the jin forces to the east xie xuan suggested to fu rong that he retreat west to allow jin forces to cross and fú jiān and fu rong agreed but as the retreat started the former qin forces panicked and could not be stopped fu rong trying to calm the troops suddenly had his horse fall under him and he was killed by jin forces which further led to a complete collapse of former qin forces fú jiān himself was hit by a stray arrow and was forced to flee to murong chui whose army was one of the few that did not collapse murong chuis son murong bao and brother murong de tried to persuade him to kill fú jiān and reestablish yan but murong chui refused escorting fú jiān safely back to luoyang after the battle of fei riveredit murong chui while not willing to resort to murder due to fú jiāns earlier kindness to him did decide however to try to reestablish yan under the pretense of wanting to calm the people of the eastern empire he persuaded fú jiān to allow him to lead an army northeast despite opposition by quan yi  as murong chui arrived at yecheng he and fu pi suspected each other but each ruled out suggestions by their respective subordinates to ambush the other as at this time the dingling chief zhai bin  rebelled against former qin with assistance with murong chuis nephew murong feng  and attacked luoyang and fu pi sent murong chui south to relieve luoyang with the di general fu feilong 飛龍 as his assistant on the way to luoyang murong chui ambushed fu feilong and slaughtered his di soldiers but still wrote an explanation to fú jiān in spring  however murong chui would join zhai and claim the title prince of yan establishing later yan he soon captured many cities in the eastern empire although yecheng and luoyang held out against him meanwhile murong chuis nephew and murong weis brother murong hong upon hearing news of murong chuis uprising gathered some xianbei soldiers and started his own rebellion within guanzhong claiming his old former yan title of prince of jibei and starting western yan fú jiān sent his brother fu rui 叡 the duke of julu assisted by yao chang against murong hong murong hong in fear was about to leave guanzhong and fu rui was intent on cutting off his escape route despite yaos suggestion to let the xianbei leave instead murong hong forced into combat defeated and killed fu rui when yao sent messengers to the capital to report the defeat fú jiān for reasons unknown got so angry that he killed yaos messengers—causing yao to panic and flee with qiang soldiers yao then declared himself the prince of qin of ten thousand years  establishing later qin meanwhile murong hong advanced on changan and he was joined by another brother murong chong he demanded that fú jiān escort murong wei to him and murong wei while pledging allegiance to fú jiān secretly send messengers to murong hong urging him to attack changan although murong hong was then murdered by his own generals and replaced with murong chong who claimed the title of crown prince meanwhile fú jiān himself led an army against yao but was unsuccessful fú jiāns son fu hui 暉 the duke of pingyuan then abandoned luoyang to come to changans aid and all of the eastern empire was lost except for yecheng meanwhile jin also launched campaigns and would recapture the modern chongqing sichuan and southern shaanxi region by early  as well as capturing much of the former qin territory south of the yellow river although jin forces under xie xuan would at times be in temporary alliance with fu pi against later yan as well in late  murong wei tried to kill fú jiān at a feast and after this was discovered fú jiān put him and the other xianbei inside changan to death murong chong upon hearing this news declared himself emperor in early  he would continue to deal fu hui defeats and fu hui in anger over the defeats and fú jiāns rebukes in light of the defeats committed suicide with murong chong surrounding changan changan fell into a terrible famine fú jiān decided that he would lead an army out of the city to try to capture food supplies and he left his crown prince fu hong in charge of the city but as soon as he left the city fell and fu hong fled to jin meanwhile fú jiān himself took his army to wujiang mountain  in modern baoji shaanxi but was surrounded and captured by later qin forces and taken to xinping  in modern xianyang shaanxi and imprisoned there with his concubine consort zhang his son fu shen 詵 the duke of zhongshan and his daughter fu bao 寶 and fu jin 錦 yao chang tried to persuade him to ceremonially pass the throne to him but fú jiān angry at yaos betrayal refused he also killed fu bao and fu jin reasoning that he did not want to let yaos followers humiliate them in fall  yao sent his soldiers to strangle fú jiān consort zhang and fu shen committed suicide even later qin soldiers mourned fú jiān however and yao in order to pretend as if he did not put fú jiān to death posthumously honored him as

jiān to stop the campaigns against jin while not trusting the xianbei and qiang officials as much as he has done after wang died however fú jiān did not agree with his last words and continued to bestow authority on the xianbei and qiang officials after wang mengs deathedit after wang mengs death fú jiān continued to carry out his campaigns to try to unite the empire these campaigns while largely successful were according to historical resources draining on the resources of the empire and of the people and wore out his troops further fú jiān who was known for thrifty living in his early years began to spend somewhat extravagantly on palace designs further one of wangs focus areas—to keep the governmental officials honest and competent—appeared to have been ignored as one began to see false governmental reports in historical records for example in  former qin suffered a major locust infestation that required a failed extermination effort throughout you  modern beijing tianjin and northern hebei qing  modern central and eastern shandong ji  modern central hebei and bing  modern shanxi provinces—and yet the governmental records paradoxically recorded that these provinces except you province received large yields on their crop fields and that the locusts did not infest the hemp and bean plants a fairly impossible scenario this suggested that government officials were no longer reporting statuses of their provinces honestly but were only making reports that pleased fú jiān and the high level officials this might be because fú jiān after wangs death felt that he had to personally oversee everything and was burdening himself with too many tasks as evidenced in an edict that he issued in  indicating that his workload was burdening him so much that half of his hair turned white in fall  fú jiān launched a major attack against former liang after its ruler zhang tianxi refused to show submission by visiting the former qin capital changan and further killed fú jiāns messengers zhangs generals who were displeased with the young favorites that he had installed in the regime either surrendered or were defeated easily and in less than a month zhang was forced to surrender and former liangs territory modern central and western gansu northern qinghai and eastern xinjiang were annexed to former qin just two months later fú jiān launched another major campaign against dai and in light of the recent assassination of its prince tuoba shiyijian by his son tuoba shijun  conquered it as well although he permitted tuoba shiyijians grandson tuoba gui to remain under the care of tribal chief liu kuren  and be the eventual heir presumptive to the dai throne in  fú jiān sent fu pi murong wei and gou chang  to attack the important jin border city of xiangyang  in modern xiangfan hubei at gous suggestion fu pi ordered that xiangyang be surrounded to force it into submission at minimal losses but fú jiān unhappy at his sons slow pace in capturing the city ordered fu pi to either capture the city by spring  or commit suicide fu pi therefore launched a major assault on the city capturing it in spring  weixing  in modern ankang shaanxi also fell at the same time however another army sent by fú jiān commanded by peng chao  after capturing pengcheng  in modern xuzhou jiangsu was defeated by the jin general xie xuan and forced to abandon pengcheng in  fú jiāns cousin fu luo 洛 the duke of xingtang who felt slighted by not being sufficiently rewarded for his victories against dai in  and believed that fú jiān had worn out his troops rebelled he was however crushed by the general lü guang and captured but fú jiān did not kill him but only exiled him this was heavily criticized by historians who believed that fú jiān by not executing fu luo and several others in similar situations encouraged future rebellions that eventually brought down his empire also in  fú jiān carried out a historically controversial decision to distribute his di people—a small minority in his empire—to various regions of the empire under the command of his sons and other generals he probably intended to have them serve as a stabilizing force throughout the empire but the shortterm result was that the heart of the empire guanzhong was left with few di and filled with xianbei and qiang which would eventually cause a destabilizing effect he also summoned his brother fu rong back to the capital and take over posts previously held by wang meng fu pi replaced fu rong in his responsibilities as viceroy over the eastern empire in late  fú jiān again planned to conquer jin most of the important officials opposed—including the prime minister fu rong however the campaign was supported by murong chui and yao chang and fú jiān became intent to carrying it out and when an official raised the point that the yangtze river was difficult to cross he made the remarks we have so many soldiers that if they threw down their whips it would be enough to stop the flow of the yangtze in  fú jiān sent lü on a campaign to xiyu  modern xinjiang and former soviet central asia where some of the kingdoms had submitted to former qin as vassals but some had not lüs campaign would last several years and be quite successful—but by the time it was complete fú jiān would be dead and former qin would be near destruction battle of fei riveredit main article battle of fei river in  fú jiān launched the campaign under fu rongs command despite fu rongs opposition after initial victories capturing the jin city of shouyang  in modern luan anhui the former qin advance troops would suffer some losses at the hands of xie xuan and liu laozhi  and the armies would be stalemated at the fei river which no longer exists but likely flowed through modern luan near the huai river with the former qin forces to the west of the river and the jin forces to the east xie xuan suggested to fu rong that he retreat west to allow jin forces to cross and fú jiān and fu rong agreed but as the retreat started the former qin forces panicked and could not be stopped fu rong trying to calm the troops suddenly had his horse fall under him and he was killed by jin forces which further led to a complete collapse of former qin forces fú jiān himself was hit by a stray arrow and was forced to flee to murong chui whose army was one of the few that did not collapse murong chuis son murong bao and brother murong de tried to persuade him to kill fú jiān and reestablish yan but murong chui refused escorting fú jiān safely back to luoyang after the battle of fei riveredit murong chui while not willing to resort to murder due to fú jiāns earlier kindness to him did decide however to try to reestablish yan under the pretense of wanting to calm the people of the eastern empire he persuaded fú jiān to allow him to lead an army northeast despite opposition by quan yi  as murong chui arrived at yecheng he and fu pi suspected each other but each ruled out suggestions by their respective subordinates to ambush the other as at this time the dingling chief zhai bin  rebelled against former qin with assistance with murong chuis nephew murong feng  and attacked luoyang and fu pi sent murong chui south to relieve luoyang with the di general fu feilong 飛龍 as his assistant on the way to luoyang murong chui ambushed fu feilong and slaughtered his di soldiers but still wrote an explanation to fú jiān in spring  however murong chui would join zhai and claim the title prince of yan establishing later yan he soon captured many cities in the eastern empire although yecheng and luoyang held out against him meanwhile murong chuis nephew and murong weis brother murong hong upon hearing news of murong chuis uprising gathered some xianbei soldiers and started his own rebellion within guanzhong claiming his old former yan title of prince of jibei and starting western yan fú jiān sent his brother fu rui 叡 the duke of julu assisted by yao chang against murong hong murong hong in fear was about to leave guanzhong and fu rui was intent on cutting off his escape route despite yaos suggestion to let the xianbei leave instead murong hong forced into combat defeated and killed fu rui when yao sent messengers to the capital to report the defeat fú jiān for reasons unknown got so angry that he killed yaos messengers—causing yao to panic and flee with qiang soldiers yao then declared himself the prince of qin of ten thousand years  establishing later qin meanwhile murong hong advanced on changan and he was joined by another brother murong chong he demanded that fú jiān escort murong wei to him and murong wei while pledging allegiance to fú jiān secretly send messengers to murong hong urging him to attack changan although murong hong was then murdered by his own generals and replaced with murong chong who claimed the title of crown prince meanwhile fú jiān himself led an army against yao but was unsuccessful fú jiāns son fu hui 暉 the duke of pingyuan then abandoned luoyang to come to changans aid and all of the eastern empire was lost except for yecheng meanwhile jin also launched campaigns and would recapture the modern chongqing sichuan and southern shaanxi region by early  as well as capturing much of the former qin territory south of the yellow river although jin forces under xie xuan would at times be in temporary alliance with fu pi against later yan as well in late  murong wei tried to kill fú jiān at a feast and after this was discovered fú jiān put him and the other xianbei inside changan to death murong chong upon hearing this news declared himself emperor in early  he would continue to deal fu hui defeats and fu hui in anger over the defeats and fú jiāns rebukes in light of the defeats committed suicide with murong chong surrounding changan changan fell into a terrible famine fú jiān decided that he would lead an army out of the city to try to capture food supplies and he left his crown prince fu hong in charge of the city but as soon as he left the city fell and fu hong fled to jin meanwhile fú jiān himself took his army to wujiang mountain  in modern baoji shaanxi but was surrounded and captured by later qin forces and taken to xinping  in modern xianyang shaanxi and imprisoned there with his concubine consort zhang his son fu shen 詵 the duke of zhongshan and his daughter fu bao 寶 and fu jin 錦 yao chang tried to persuade him to ceremonially pass the throne to him but fú jiān angry at yaos betrayal refused he also killed fu bao and fu jin reasoning that he did not want to let yaos followers humiliate them in fall  yao sent his soldiers to strangle fú jiān consort zhang and fu shen committed suicide even later qin soldiers mourned fú jiān however and yao in

mainland china fujian is bordered by zhejiang to the north jiangxi to the west and guangdong to the south the name fujian came from the combination of fuzhou and jianzhou a former name for jianou two cities in fujian during the tang dynasty while its population is chiefly of han origin it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in china most of fujian is administered by the peoples republic of china prc however the archipelagos of kinmen and matsu are under the control of the republic of china roc aka taiwan thus there are two provinces in the sense of government organizations the fujian province administered by the prc and the fujian province of the roc fujian province where most of the overseas chinese in southeast asia originated from is still famously

millennium bc from the keqiutou site – bp an early neolithic site in pingtan island located about  kilometres  mi southeast of fuzhou numerous tools made of stones shells bones jades and ceramics including wheelmadeceramics have been unearthed together with spinning wheels a definitive evidence of weaving the tanshishan  site – bp in suburban fuzhou spans the neolithic and chalcolithic age where semiunderground circular buildings were found in the lower level the huangtulun  site ca bc also in suburban fuzhou was of the bronze age in character minyueedit see also minyue fujian was also the place for the kingdom of minyue the word mǐnyuè was derived by combining mǐn  pe̍hōejī bân perhaps an ethnic name and associated with the chinese word for barbarianscitation needed  pinyin mán poj bân and yuè after the state of yue a spring and autumn period kingdom in zhejiang to the north this is because the royal family of yuè fled to fujian after their kingdom was annexed by the state of chu in  bc mǐn is also the name of the main river in this area but the ethnonym is probably earlier imperial chinaedit han dynastyedit see also han campaigns against minyue minyue was a de facto kingdom until the emperor of qin dynasty the first unified imperial chinese state abolished the status in the aftermath of the fall of the qin dynasty however civil war broke out between two warlords xiang yu and liu bang the minyue king wuzhu sent his troops to fight sidebyside with liu bang and his gamble paid off liu bang was victorious and founded the han dynasty in  bc he restored minyues status as a tributary independent kingdom thus wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in fuzhou as well as a few locations in the wuyi mountains which have been excavated in recent years his kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary fujian into eastern guangdong eastern jiangxi and southern zhejiang after the death of wuzhu minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in guangdong jiangxi and zhejiang mostly in the nd century bc only to be stopped by the han dynasty as it expanded southward the han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by sending a military campaign against minyue large forces approached minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in  bc the rulers in fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction thus the first kingdom in fujian history came to an abrupt end the han dynasty collapsed at the end of the nd century ad paving the way for the three kingdoms era sun quan the founder of the kingdom of wu spent nearly twenty years subduing the shan yue people the branch of the yue living in mountains first han chinese migrationedit the first wave of immigration of the noble class arrived in the province in the early th century when the western jin dynasty collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north as well as civil war these immigrants were primarily from eight families in central china lin  huang  chen  zheng  zhan  qiu  he  and hu  the first four remain as the major surnames of modern fujian nevertheless isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to fujians relatively undeveloped economy and level of development despite major population boost from northern china during the barbarian invasions population density in fujian remained low compared to the rest of china only two commanderies and sixteen counties were established by the western jin dynasty like other southern provinces such as guangdong guangxi guizhou and yunnan fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time during the southern and northern dynasties era the southern dynasties reigned south of the yangtze river including fujian sui and tang dynastiesedit see also early western influence in fujian during sui and tang eras a large influx of migrants came and settled in fujian the tang dynasty – oversaw the next golden age of china and culturally and economically benefited fujian greatly fujians capital fuzhous economic and cultural institutions grew and developed the later years of the tang dynasty saw a number of political upheavals in the chinese heartland prompting another wave of chinese to immigrate to the modernday fujian as the tang dynasty ended china was torn apart in the period of the five dynasties and ten kingdoms during this time a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of fujian led by general wang who set up an independent kingdom of min with its capital in fuzhou after the death of the founding king however the kingdom suffered from internal strife and was soon swallowed up by southern tang another southern kingdom quanzhou was blooming into a seaport under the reign of the min kingdomcitation needed and was the largest seaport in the worldwhen its population is also greater than fuzhou due to the ispah rebellion quanzhou was severely damaged song dynastyedit the lý dynasty monarchs of vietnam were of chinese ethnicity fujian province jinjiang village was the origin of lý thái tổ  the ancestor of the lý dynasty ruling familya china fujian was the home of lý công uẩn the ethnic chinese background of lý công uẩn has been accepted by vietnamese historian trần quốc vượng the founder of the trần dynasty in vietnam emperor trần thái tông was the great grandon of a chinese who came to vietnam from fujian from the chinese chen clan and several members of the family like prince trần quốc tuấn continued to be able to speak chinese the name of his great grandfather was trần kinh people from song dynasty china like zhao zhong and xu zongdao fled to tran dynasty ruled vietnam after the mongol invasion of the song the tran dynasty originated from the fujian region of china as did the daoist cleric xu zongdao who recorded the mongol invasion and referred to them as northern bandits fujian was the origin of the ethnic chinese tran who migrated to vietnam along with a large amount of other chinese during the ly dynasty where they served as officials distinctly chinese last names are found in the tran and ly dynasty imperial exam records ethnic chinese are recorded in tran and ly dynasty records of officials clothing food and language were all chinese dominated in van don where the tran had moved to after leaving their home province of fujian the chinese language could still be spoken by the tran in vietnam the ocean side area of vietnam was colonized by chinese migrants from fujian which included the tran among them located to the capitals southeastern area the red river delta was subjected to migration from fujian including the tran and van don port arose as a result of this interaction guangdong and fujian chinese moved to the halong located van don coastal port during ly anh tongs rule in order to engage in commerce the usurpation of the ly occurred after they married with the fishing fujianese tran family in  fujian was attacked by pisheye pirates ming dynastyedit in the early ming dynasty quanzhou was the staging area and supply depot of zheng hes naval expeditions further development was severely hampered by the sea trade ban of the ming dynasty and the area was superseded by nearby ports of guangzhou hangzhou ningbo and shanghai despite the lifting of the ban in citation needed largescale piracy by wokou was eventually wiped out by chinese military and japanese authority of toyotomi hideyoshicitation needed an account of ming dynasty fujian was written by no in  the pisheya appear in quanzhou ming era records qing dynastyedit late ming and early qing dynasty symbolized an era of large influx of refugees and another  years of sea trade ban under the kangxi emperor a measure intended to counter the refuge ming government of koxinga in the island of taiwan the seaban implented by the qing forced many people to evacuate the coast in order to deprive koxingas ming loyalists of resources this has led to a myth that it was because manchus were afraid of water incoming refugees however did not translate into a major labor force owing to their remigration into prosperous regions of guangdong in  the qing dynasty conquered taiwan and annexed it into fujian province as taiwan prefecture settlement of taiwan by han chinese followed and the majority of people in taiwan are descendants of hokkien people from southern fujian fujian arrived at its present extent after taiwan was developed into an independent province fujiantaiwanprovince starting in  just ten more years later the qing ceded taiwan to japan via the treaty of shimonoseki after losing the first sinojapanese war in  republican chinaedit owing to the mountainous landscape fujian was the most secluded province of the prc in eastern china due to the lack of rail and underdeveloped networks of paved roads before the s the first railway to the province the yingtanxiamen railway was completed in  despite its secluded location fujian has had a strong academic tradition since the southern song dynasty at the time north china was occupied by the jurchen jin dynasty during the jinsong wars which caused a shift of the cultural center of china to the south benefiting fuzhou and other southern cities in the chinese academy of science and chinese academy of engineering there are more members from fuzhou than from any other citycitation needed in addition it should also be pointed out that the slow development of fujian in its early days has proven a blessing for the provinces ecology today the province has the highest forest coverage rate and the most diverse biosphere in china whereas central china suffers from severe overpopulation and displays severe signs of soil erosion accompanied by frequent droughts and floods due to lack of forest coveragecitation needed since the late s the economy of fujian along the coast has greatly benefited from its geographic and cultural proximity to taiwan in  xiamen ranked number eight gdp per capita among  chinese cities ahead of shanghai and beijing while fuzhou ranked no  number  among  provincial capitalscitation needed the development has been accompanied by a large influx of population from the overpopulated areas in the north and west and much of the farmland and forest as well as cultural heritage sites such as the temples of king wuzhu have given way to ubiquitous highrise buildings and the government faces challenges at all levels to sustain development while at the same time preserving the unique and vital natural and cultural heritage of fujian geographyedit wuyi mountains min river 江）in nanping  the province is mostly
