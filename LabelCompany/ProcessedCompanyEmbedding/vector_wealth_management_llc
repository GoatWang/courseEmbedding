software application with a primary purpose of fulfilling our unique value as a financial wealth management firm that unique value is to give our clients an understanding and confidence around their financial lives that they may not have experienced before this process creates a custom investment policy that is based on what you’re asking your assets to do technically we call it liabilitydriven investing liabilitydriven investing allows your assets to support your income need through timeframe appropriate allocations for high probability returns characteristics of our process   assets are segmented based on when they will be consumed page  portfolio adjustments are made over time page  your retirement income is staged to best take advantage of market cycles page  assets are segmented based on when they will be consumed typically the first pie chart that clients are introduced to is some sort of asset allocation division which in our opinion couldn’t be more backwards at vector we determine how much of each of our clients assets have to be in specific timeframes to help support the income objectives they have in retirement our objective is to first come to an agreement around the stability of the plan and then make decisions around allocation relative to that stability we use a personal approach to design lower risk portfolios that are specific and unique to your cash flow needs determining the asset amounts that need to be available to you over various timeframes we segregate assets into four portfolios based on timeframes to support the income objectives each individual has during retirement securing a stable retirement income stream builds a level of confidence within our clients allowing them to enjoy what they worked so hard to create the level of stability of the plan influences our discussions regarding asset allocation these discussions lead to an investment policy based on this highly refined division of assets to support each client’s lifestyle portfolios adjustments are made over time as you begin to consume from your assured income portfolio all four portfolios are adjusted to achieve the growth or stability required over the assigned timeframe this process of timeframe segmentation is utilized to assign specific tasks and timeframes to your assets securing them for their intended usage this approach allows us to decide how to adjust portfolios independent of current market conditions portfolio  assured income this portfolio provides income for the first one to four years of retirement making certain that these assets are subject to minimal market risk portfolio  preservation this portfolio has a time frame of four to six years due to the relatively short time frame this portfolio relies on a preservation strategy with a growth component to address anticipated inflation portfolio  accumulation this is the first portfolio with more of a growth component due to the fact that we have approximately two to four market cycles or  years for these assets to grow portfolio  legacy this is the longterm growth portfolio with the greatest flexibility to orient toward growth depending most specifically on your risk tolerance and objectives your retirement income is staged to best take advantage of market cycles while we know that investment markets go through cycles it is difficult to predict exactly when a cycle will start or end segregating portfolios based on return expectations and time horizons achieves the growth or stability required over the assigned timeframe liberating your income sources from the volatility of market cycles the two most challenging decisions around investing are generally accepted to be when to put money into the market and when to take money out of the market for income when you need it sojourn® creates a discipline around withdrawal strategies through a process of funding income needs one to four years in advance     copyright   vector wealth management   disclaimer
