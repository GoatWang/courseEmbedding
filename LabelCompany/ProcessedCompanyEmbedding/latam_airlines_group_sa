airlines group sa is the result of the merger between lan airlines sa and tam sa the merger also included lan and tams respective affiliates and subsidiaries across south america this association creates one of the largest airline groups in the world latam airlines group sa now offers more destinations than any other airline group in south america  tibco was selected basically because of its resiliency robustness and of course the good references that we received during the selection process juan carlos ferrer  director of enterprise architecture latam airlines group how latam airlines used tibco to make its connection merging airline companies with tibco integration challenge realtime computing is part of almost everything an airline does from coordinating departures and boarding passengers to managing inventory with technology so deeply ingrained in business operations mergers can create a serious migration problem when lan and tam airlines merged they faced the challenge of how to unify their processes and integrate their systems to appreciate what an undertaking it was to merge lan and tam’s computing you must understand the depth of the duplication “we have several processes backoffice processes as well as operational and customerfacing processes and for each of those we have systems that lan and tam needed to integrate” explains juan carlos ferrer director of enterprise architecture for latam airlines group combining these systems would be a challenge in and of itself but the new company needed to do it without any major interruption to customer service “we are very pressed on the one hand to accomplish the objective of merging both companies’ processes and on the other hand to keep up with what the customer is expecting in terms of the service” says ferrer solution latam decided the best course of action would be to introduce a serviceoriented architecture soa that would allow deeply embedded legacy systems to interact with newer systems that could be more easily changed it also meant a simpler and shorter unification process because they wouldn’t have to start from scratch “not only did we need good governance but an infrastructure that guarantees us very high levels of resiliency and robustness and one that would make sure this change would not impact the continuity of the business” says ferrer starting with tibco activematrix® service bus as a mediation layer latam uses tibco enterprise message service™ to communicate between infrastructures and systems new and old in addition tibco activematrix businessworks™ is used as a platform for implementing new processes and propagating scheduled changes to legacy systems benefits fast integration and faster service delivery with tibco technologies latam integrated and merged systems quickly while establishing a foundation for the future its soa approach helped them connect several systems from all corners of the organization and it even helped them deliver services faster “with good soa governance with good definition of canonical entities service interfaces and business services and by using tibco businessworks we were able to provide services with a very good time to market” says ferrer future now that latam has established a source of events it is weighing the value of big data and analytics “that’s something we’re really looking forward to using in the future we believe that we might connect with the big data notion the event processing concept as well we’re waiting for the correct time to merge them into a solution” said ferrer  amount of downtime required

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
