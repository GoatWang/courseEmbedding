thiosulfate description background of the invention   field of the invention  the present invention relates to a process for the production of ammonium thiosulfate and more particularly a process for producing ammonium thiosulfate from a feed gas stream containing a mixture of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide   description of the prior art  ammonia and hydrogen sulfide gases are frequently found together in mixtures with water or other gaseous components such mixtures are often a byproduct of petroleum refining and chemical process particularly where crude oils and feedstocks containing nitrogen and sulfur compounds are processed not only can ammonia and hydrogen sulfide occur naturally in the raw material they can also be produced as decomposition products from such processes as distillation cracking and coking the nitrogen and sulfur content of a feed material can be reduced by conversion to ammonia and hydrogen sulfide in catalytic hydrogen treating processes such as hydrodesulfurization hydrocracking and reforming mixtures of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide can also result from processes such as ore reduction metal refining papermaking and coal distillation  these byproduct gases were once considered waste and either incinerated or burned in combustion furnaces to recover their fuel value even so combustion is not a desirable means of disposal as the oxides of nitrogen and sulfur produced and found in the flue gases are corrosive cause unsightly stack plumes and contribute to atmospheric pollution  ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are also found in sulfidic waters produced from such processes or are obtained by scrubbing the aforementioned gases to remove the ammonium and hydrogen sulfide therefrom in the past waste sulfidic waters were frequently disposed of by discharging them to streams rivers lakes oceans or other convenient bodies of water  out of growing concern for water and air pollution coupled with stringent regulations regarding plant water and gaseous effluent quality various processes have been developed to treat these byproduct effluent streams stripping of the noxious ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from the sulfidic waters has been used to improve the quality of effluent waters however the stripped gases commonly referred to as sour water stripper off gas swsg still present a disposal problem most prior art processes that have dealt with the swsg stream have either been complicated required extensive plant investment entailed high operating costs failed to produce a readily marketable product for which a reasonably stable demand existed or were unsuitable for the treatment of relatively small or intermittent byproduct streams although some of these processes provide a suitable means of disposing of the byproduct effluents they fail to yield products of commercial value  it clearly would be desirable to have a method for processing a gas stream containing ammonia and hydrogen sulfide whereby a salable product could be produced to this end us pat no  discloses a process for treating ammonia and hydrogen sulfide gas mixtures to produce ammonium thiosulfate and sulfur the sulfur typically being present in the aqueous ammonium thiosulfate solution as finely divided crystals summary of the invention  it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for recovering the value of the ammonia present in an swsg by converting it to ammonium thiosulfate a readily marketable chemical  another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing ammonium thiosulfate from a gas mixture comprising ammonia and hydrogen sulfide by utilizing the ammonia therein without the necessity of separating it from the other components of the mixture and without the need for ammonia from any additional source  still a further object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of ammonium thiosulfate from a gas mixture comprising ammonia and hydrogen sulfide wherein hydrogen sulfide in excess of stoichiometric requirements is selectively rejected as an offgas stream essentially free of ammonia and sulfur dioxide  yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing ammonium thiosulfate from a gas mixture comprising ammonium and hydrogen sulfide wherein an effluent stream from the process whether gaseous or liquid does not adversely affect the environment or subsequent downstream processes  according to the process of the present invention a feed gas mixture comprising hydrogen sulfide and ammonia is contacted preferably in a spraytype absorber with an aqueous absorbing stream comprising ammonium thiosulfate ammonium bisulfate and ammonium sulfite in a first reaction zone the contacting is conducted under conditions that limit the conversion of sulfite to thiosulfate and produces an ammoniarich absorbing stream that has a lower concentration of sulfite—ie a sulfitelean stream unreacted hydrogen sulfide is rejected from the ammoniarich absorbing stream in the first reaction zone producing or leaving a liquid first reaction zone product free of unabsorbed gases sulfur dioxide gas from a suitable sulfur dioxidecontaining gas stream is absorbed in the ammoniarich absorbing stream in the absence of any substantial quantity of hydrogen sulfide in a second reaction zone to produce a second reaction zone product free of unabsorbed gases at least a portion of the second reaction zone product is recycled to the first reaction zone an aqueous product stream of ammonium thiosulfate is recovered from one of the first or second reaction zone products  in the process of the present invention by limiting the conversion of sulfite to thiosulfite there is produced a stream with a lower concentration of sulfite the unreacted hydrogen sulfide being rejected from the sulfitelean stream in the first reaction zone the sulfitelean stream from the first reaction zone is passed to a second reaction zone wherein it contacts a gaseous stream containing s that is absorbed from the gaseous stream converting sulfite ion to bisulfitebrief description of the drawings  the single figure is a schematic diagram of the process of the present inventiondescription of the preferred embodiment  while the present invention will be described with particular application to the use of an swsg stream as the feed gas mixture used in the process of the present invention it is to be understood that it is not so limited and that the feed gas mixture can be any mixture of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide in which the mol ratio of ammonia to hydrogen sulfite is no greater than  and which can contain other gases as well as certain entrained liquids regardless of the source of such feed gas a typical swsg stream generally contains equal molar concentrations of ammonia hydrogen sulfide and water vapor consequently the hydrogen sulfide is present in quantities in excess of that required to produce ammonium thiosulfate according to the following wellknown equation nhsohsho→nhso i  thus to produce  moles of ammonium thiosulfate  moles of ammonia  moles of sulfur dioxide and  moles of hydrogen sulfide are required  with reference then to the figure a feed gas mixture eg an swsg stream enters a prescrubber column  via a line  prescrubber column  can comprise any form of gasliquid contacting device preferably of the countercurrent variety whereby the feed gas mixture entering prescrubber column  via line  is contacted with a prescrubber solution of ammonium thiosulfate or other suitable scrubbing medium introduced into prescrubber column  via line  stream  being heated in exchanger  via a steam source from line  and comprising a recycle stream  from prescrubber column  plus any makeup solution line  pump  and line  form a recycle loop of prescrubber column  makeup solution being added to the loop as needed prescrubber column  can operate at a temperature about the same as or slightly above the temperature of the swsg stream in line  eg approximately ° f to avoid condensation and resultant accumulation of water exchanger  serves to ensure that the incoming prescrubber solution is maintained at a temperature slightly above that of the feed gas entering via line  so as to avoid accumulation of water in prescrubber column   prescrubber column  serves the function of removing trace amounts of impurities that could adversely affect the quality of the desired ammonium thiosulfate product it is well known that swsg streams may contain phenols organic acids hydrocarbons and hydrogen cyanide to mention just a few hydrogen cyanide can react with thiosulfate producing thiocyanate while organic acids and phenols can react with ammonia producing high boiling point phenates and the corresponding salts of the acids accumulated hydrocarbonsoils are periodically removed from prescrubber column  by skimming the top of the aqueous prescrubber solution the hydrocarbonsoils being removed from prescrubber column  via line  to be sent to waste or further treatment a purge stream of prescrubber solution is periodically discharged from the recycle loop of prescrubber column  via line  valve  and line  makeup thiosulfate solution recovered from thiosulfate product stream  is periodically introduced into the recycle loop of prescrubber column  via line  and valve   prescrubber column  can comprise any form of gasliquid contactor preferably of the countercurrent variety and can employ trays as well as structured or random packing the prescrubber solution need not be aqueous ammonium thiosulfate but can be other solutions depending upon the impurities present in the feed gas in line  lastly it is to be recognized that if the feed gas in line  contains no impurities that are deleterious to the process or the end product the prescrubber  may be dispensed with in its entirety  prescrubbed gas is removed as an overhead fraction from prescrubber column  via line  and is introduced into a venturi scrubber  where it is contacted with an aqueous absorbing stream introduced via line  through valve  the aqueous absorbing stream is comprised primarily of from  to  wt  of dissolved ammonium thiosulfate ats and from  to  wt  of ammonium bisulfite abs and ammonium sulfite as as well as minor amounts of other salts of ammonia and sulfur species the hydrogen sulfide and ammonia that are absorbed in venturi scrubber  react with the aqueous sulfite ions present in the absorbing stream introduced via line  per equation i above to produce ammonium thiosulfate since the reaction of hydrogen sulfide in the liquid phase to produce thiosulfate occurs instantaneously it is necessary according to the process of the present invention to limit the conversion of the sulfite ion to the thiosulfate ion if the reaction is allowed to go to completion there will be no residual ammonia to absorb sulfur dioxide in the abs absorber system or the solution returned to the abs absorber system will contain ammonium sulfide which could possibly result in the release of hydrogen sulfide in downstream operations a result that is to be avoided as described more fully hereinafter absorption of hydrogen sulfide can be controlled as a function of the vaporliquid contact in scrubber  which in turn is varied depending on the redox potential in the absorbing stream entering scrubber  through line  on the otherhand absorption of ammonia in the absorber stream is almost complete thereby producing an ammoniarich absorbing stream  the ammoniarich absorbing stream from scrubber  is introduced into vessel  vessel  contains an internal baffle system comprising a vapor barrier baffle  and a weir  in effect vessel  defines a first chamber  having a gas space above to permit unabsorbed gases to disengage from the absorbing stream and a second chamber  also having a gas space above the liquids therein for disengagement of unabsorbed gases it can thus be seen that liquid from chamber  can flow into chamber  an ammonium thiosulfate product stream is removed from chamber  of vessel  via line  and pump  one portion of the product stream passing through line  and valve  into line  for product recovery and another portion of the product stream being recycled via line  to scrubber  an online ph probe  monitors the ph of a slip stream flowing through line  to ensure that the ph of the absorbing solution entering scrubber  via line  valve  and line  is from about  to about  probe  is connected to a controller not shown that controls the addition of sulfur dioxide to the process to maintain the appropriate ph  as noted above it is important in the process of the present invention that absorption of hydrogen sulfide in scrubber  be carefully controlled so as to prevent complete conversion of sulfite ion to thiosulfate ion as was also noted this can be accomplished by controlling the liquid to gas ratio in scrubber  which in turn is adjusted in response to the redox potential of the absorbing stream in line  an oxidation reduction probe orp  monitors the redox potential of the absorbing solution introduced into scrubber  orp  serving ultimately to control via a suitable control system the amount of absorbing liquid passing through valve  thereby controlling the liquid to gas ratio in scrubber  an online specific gravity probe  determines the specific gravity of the absorbing stream passing through line  the probe  is connected to a valve  that periodically introduces a stream hereinafter described via line  to maintain the specific gravity in the desired range as hereinafter described the stream in line  while containing residual ammonium bisulfidesulfide and thiosulfate is relatively dilute and thereby serves as makeup water to control the specific gravity of the absorbing stream entering scrubber   the offgas from vessel  leaves chamber  of vessel  via line  and enters column  where it passes in countercurrent relationship to a water stream introduced via line  it is to be understood that the offgas leaving vessel  through line  is essentially hs and contains only minor amounts of ammonia which is essentially completely removed in column  thereby leaving an offgas passing from column  through line  which is essentially watersaturated hydrogen sulfide which can be combusted to produce sulfur dioxide for use in the process or if desired can be directed to a claus unit any hydrogen sulfide and ammonia absorbed in the water in column  is converted to ammonium bisulfide which passes via line  out of column   a gas stream of sulfur dioxide is introduced into venturi scrubber  via line  where it is contacted with the absorbing stream from line  via valve  in order to absorb sulfur dioxide in scrubber  it is essential that ammonia be present in the absorbing solution in line  as a mixture of ammonium bisulfite and sulfite the sulfur dioxide introduced via line  can be from any source eg combustion of sulfur or as noted above combustion of hydrogen sulfide removed from column  via line  it will also be appreciated that the sulfur dioxide produced by any such combustion process will typically contain significant amounts of nitrogen and oxygen the effluent gas from chamber  of vessel  passes via line  to a column  where any remaining unabsorbed sulfur dioxide is removed by countercurrent contact with a wash solution entering column  via line  the wash solution entering line  is comprised of the liquid effluent from column  via line  plus a recycle stream from column  via line  streams  and  being introduced via line  to a cooler  the hot liquid introduced into cooler  via line  being cooled by air or some suitable source introduced via line  and ejected from cooler  via line  the gas stream exiting column  via line  contains primarily nitrogen oxygen and water vapor with trace amounts of ammonia and sulfur dioxide in this regard it should be noted that the absorption of ammonia and sulfur dioxide and the conversion of ammonium sulfite to thiosulfate is exothermic accordingly the offgas leaving chamber  of vessel  will contain vaporized water which may be condensed in column  as previously noted the heat from the exothermic reaction is removed by exchange in cooler   as was previously noted specific gravity probe  controls valve  to permit the dilute stream in line  from the discharge of pump  to be used as makeup water to the absorbing stream in line   used in both scrubbers   and   as discussed above the process of the present invention is dependent upon limiting the conversion of sulfite ion to thiosulfate ion in the reaction between the feed gas mixture containing ammonia and hydrogen sulfide and the absorbing stream the degree of conversion of ammonium sulfite to ammonium thiosulfate is indicated by the oxidation reduction potential redox potential of the absorbing stream or solution in this case the redox potential is determined by insertion of a platinum electrode in the absorbing stream and comparing its potential versus a calomel reference electrode more specifically in this case the redox potential emis given by the following nerst equation emeortflnsoso− rtf ph soconcentration of oxidized species sulfite ion  soconcentration of reduced species thiosulfate ion  emmeasured potential vs reference electrode potential  eohalf cell potential  rgas constant  caldeg mol  ffaradays  calvolt equivalent  ttemperature degrees kelvin  experimental data has shown that the redox potential should be controlled in the range of − to − mv to ensure that residual ammonium sulfitebisulfite remains in the absorbing stream the process of the present invention is conducted such that the liquid to gas ratio lg of the absorbing stream to the feed gas mixture is periodically adjusted so as to be from  gal scf to  gal scf it was found that increasing the liquid rate drives the redox potential more negative resulting in the formation of ammonium sulfide in vessel  by varying the liquid rate of the absorbing solution one limits the hydrogen sulfide absorption and concomitantly limits the conversion of sulfite ion to thiosulfate in this regard and as previously pointed out the reaction of hydrogen sulfide and the absorbing stream to produce thiosulfate is essentially instantaneous accordingly control of the absorption of hydrogen sulfide must be maintained lest there be complete conversion of sulfite ion to thiosulfate  generally speaking the absorbing stream used in the venturi scrubbers will have a composition comprising from about  to about  wt  ats and from about  to about  wt  of a mixture of abs and as it being understood that minor amounts of other salts of ammonia and sulfur species may also be present  while the invention has been described above with respect to singlestage scrubbing of the so entering chamber  via line  it is to be understood that dualstage scrubbing could be employed for example vessel  could be modified to include a second baffle  effectively forming an additional chamber such as  with the addition of another venturi scrubber to the additional chamber gas in the head space above the liquid would be returned to the additional venturi scrubber to be contacted with scrubbing solution from line   while the process has been described above with respect to the use of venturi scrubbers it is to be understood that other types of scrubbing devices or absorbers generally of the spray type can be employed spraytype absorbers or contacting units are desirable since they are uniquely applicable to systems where high gas solubilities exists such as in this case the absorption of hydrogen sulfide in the absorbing stream nonlimiting examples of spraytype absorbers that can be used in addition to the venturi scrubbers described above include spray towers cyclonic spray towers and jet scrubbers it is to be understood that other types of absorbing or gasliquid contacting systems may be employed provided that they can be controlled to limit the absorption of the hydrogen sulfide in the absorbing liquid thus while some true countercurrent scrubbers might be employed such units would have to be carefully designed since they provide a large number of transfer units and could result in excessive absorption of hydrogen sulfide in the absorbing liquid  while the process of the present invention has been described with respect to the venturi scrubbers being mounted on a horizontal vessel or drum  it will be recognized that scrubber  could be on the inlet to column  while scrubber  could be on the inlet to column  while not changing the overall process this would allow column  to operate at a lower pressure than column  which would permit energy savings which under the embodiment shown are required for combustion of air swsg streams are normally delivered at approximately  psig by placing the venturi scrubbers on the column inlets it would only be necessary to compress the air used for combustion to  to  psig rather than the  psig necessary under the described process to keep the liquid level balance in the horizontal drum   to more fully illustrate the present invention the following nonlimiting example is presented  an swsg stream containing  tonsday of ammonia and  tonsday of hydrogen sulfide is charged as a feed stream in line  to the process generally as set forth in the drawing to provide sulfur dioxide acid gas from an amine regenerator sulfur or recycled hydrogen sulfide is fed to an incinerator or a sulfur burnerreaction furnace to produce  tonsday of sulfur dioxide feed to the process thirtyfour  tons of hydrogen sulfide in the swsg reacts with the absorbing solution to form  tonsday of ats the other  tonsday of hydrogen sulfide in the swsg are vented to be combined with a cooled gas stream downstream of a host plants claus unit combustion such that the rejected hydrogen sulfide can be recovered as elemental sulfur or recycled to the incinerator to produce sulfur dioxide the ats product produced is a  wt  aqueous solution whose concentration can be controlled by the amount of makeup water added to the process and by the operating temperatures in the reaction vessels and columns  and   the process of the present invention provides many advantages not heretofore realized in processes for producing ats particularly from gas streams such as swsg streams a typical swsg stream contains  mole of ammonia mole of hs mol of water vapor accordingly the hydrogen sulfide is present in three times the stoichiometric requirement for the reaction to produce ats by using the process of the present invention the excess hydrogen sulfide is rejected and as noted above can be used to produce sulfur or to provide sulfur dioxide for the process the process of the present invention is also simpler in that conventional processes to produce ammonium thiosulfate conduct the reaction in two reactors one to react the sulfur dioxide with aqueous ammonia to form ammonium sulfite and bisulfite the other reactor to react the product of the first reaction to ats by reduction with sulfide ion or elemental sulfur this requires the addition of sufficient water to keep the sulfitebisulfite in solution resulting in a thiosulfate concentration in the product stream well below  accordingly to obtain a product stream of  wt  ats the excess water has to be removed by means of additional equipment and energy expenditure since in the process of the present invention the sulfite bisulfite and sulfide ions are promptly converted to thiosulfate their concentrations never exceed those soluble in a concentrated solution of thiosulfate accordingly the reaction is carried out at conditions that produce aqueous ats product at or above  wt  and requires no additional water removal step or expense the aqueous ats product stream of the present invention contains the ats in a concentration sufficiently high such that when the solution is cooled to ambient temperature by a suitable means such as vacuum evaporation a substantial quantity of solid ats is produced this allows production of a solid ats product by separation of the solid from the liquid by conventional means followed by appropriate steps such as drying milling and crushing  one feature of the process of the present invention is that the unabsorbed gas from the swsg comprised mainly of water and hs is rejected from the process separately from the unabsorbed gases that enter in the sulfur dioxide feed stream in fact experimental data shows that it is not necessary to use the unabsorbed gas stream comprised primarily of nitrogen and oxygen to strip the hydrogen sulfide from the absorbing liquid as noted an advantage to this segregation is that the unreacted hydrogen sulfide can be used as a source of sulfur to produce the sulfur dioxide without causing inert gases such as nitrogen to cycle in the process since the unabsorbed gas stream from the sulfur dioxide feed stream is primarily nitrogen oxygen and perhaps trace amounts of sulfur dioxide this stream can be vented to atmosphere without any pollution concerns indeed it is a feature of the present invention that all of the streams produced in the process both liquid and gas are salable the ats stream or are useful in further reactions conversion of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur or to sulfur dioxide or are not environmentally deleterious the unabsorbed nitrogen and oxygen from the sulfur dioxide feed stream can be vented to atmosphere or can be treated for further recycle in the system via the sour water stripper or can be sent to typical treatment systems for separating oilwater mixtures in the event that the swsg feed stream is contaminated with organics  the foregoing description and examples illustrate selected embodiments of the present invention in light thereof variations and modifications will be suggested to one skilled in the art all of which are in the spirit and purview of this invention   previous patent process to reduce sticking during surface treatment of graphite articlesnext
