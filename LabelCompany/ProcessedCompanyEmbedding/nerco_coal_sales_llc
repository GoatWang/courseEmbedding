warren and rossman jj  buttler presiding judge plaintiff brought this action for damages for breach of contract material misrepresentation and fraud defendants filed counterclaims for breach of contract and fraud as well as thirdparty claims based on those theories after a jury trial the court entered judgment on a special verdict awarding plaintiff a lump sum of  in damages for breach of contract and material misrepresentation the jury rejected plaintiffs fraud claim and all of defendants counterand thirdparty claims thereafter defendants filed alternative motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial although the court denied the motion for judgment nov it concluded that the contract between the parties was unambiguous and was limited to a oneyear term and that it had erred in permitting the jury to decide the duration of the contract accordingly it granted a new trial limited to the issue of plaintiffs damages for one year on appeal plaintiff seeks reversal of that order and reinstatement of the judgment on crossappeal defendants seek a retrial of all claims counterclaims and thirdparty claims because we conclude that the court erred in limiting the new trial to the issue of plaintiffs damages we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion this case involves a contract between plaintiff deerfield commodities ltd deerfield and defendant nerco coal sales company nerco by which deerfield agreed to supply quantities of anthracite coal silt to nerco for ultimate sale to certain korean businesses deerfield was organized in the summer of  when its principals learned that korean companies sought to buy large quantities of coal silt for the production of fuel during the same period nerco inc a large producer of bituminous coal organized a new tennessee corporation nerco coal sales company to develop far eastern markets for anthracite and bituminous coal in november  nerco began discussions with both deerfield and the korean companies regarding the execution of long term multiyear contracts for the sale and purchase of coal silt during negotiations on december   nerco told deerfield that it would be responsible for ocean transportation and arrangements with the koreans deerfield stated that it would supply coal silt fobt free on board trimmed but indicated that moisture specifications outlined in previous korean contracts were unrealistic and that it would not proceed with specifications requiring less than  percent on january   after nerco had obtained two korean contracts the parties representatives met in chicago and signed a sevenpage coal supply agreement which provides in section iii  term of agreement this agreement shall be effective from the date hereof and shall terminate on december   or upon delivery of  tons of coal whichever occurs first except that the term and quantities may be extended andor increased pursuant to section iv and xxi sections iv and xxi provide

scheduled vessel shipments specified in exhibit a in a timely manner section xxi  option to extend buyer shall have the option to extend this agreement for an additional four years by notifying seller of its election to  exercise said option within thirty days of the termination date hereof or the extended termination date hereof in such event all terms of this agreement shall be the same

to the date of the option exercise  buyer shall have no obligation to pay all amounts for sales broker or similar fees and  buyer may increase the annual tons to be delivered up to  tons the agreement also contained an integration clause and a prohibition on oral modification section xxii  entire agreement this document contains the entire agreement between the parties and is entered into by the parties in reliance upon buyer obtaining a coal contract with dai han coal corporation of the republic of korea the contract with dai han coal corporation shall be attached as exhibit a and the terms thereof shall apply hereto as they relate to seller if such contract with dai han coal corporation is not signed by january   this agreement becomes null and void and shall have no further effect there are no other understandings representations or agreements between the parties section xiii  nonwaiver cumulative remedies and amendments    any and all amendments supplements and modifications to this agreement shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto on the same day the parties executed a single written supplement to the coal supply agreement entitled addedum sic to contract no  the addendum was prepared by nercos counsel at deerfields request and provides in pertinent part notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the above entitled contract the deerfield contract the parties agree  there are two  contracts fkxdhcc  and kfxdhcc  between hyosung corporation daewonsa company ltd nerco coal sales co international fuel corporation each providing for an initial sale of  mtons of product  deerfield commodities ltd shall be the source of product for both contracts and all extensions thereof under the terms of the deerfield contract except as provided herein  a for contract kfxdhcc  with hyosung corporation the purchase price to deerfield shall be thirty and  dollars  b contract kfxdhcc  with hyosung corporation is hereby attached as exhibit b and deerfield shall comply with all obligations therein required by nerco as the supplier of coal fob    d the price in section xxi option to extend shall be  rather than  for the hyosung corporation kfxdhcc  contract both the dai han and the hyosung contracts mentioned in the coal supply agreement and the addendum contain a quantity provision stating that the amount purchased is  metric tons  percent more or less at the sellers option and a oneyear schedule showing shipments beginning in march and ending in december  those contracts also provide for liquidated damages keyed to the agreed shipping schedule and  metric tons and require nerco to post a performance bond which shall be released upon instruction of the buyer after satisfactory completion  of the contract or its expiry sic date whichever may be sooner each korean contract also has an attachment providing long term  buyer shall give a priority to the korean sellersupplier who has participated in mine andor silt operation through investment under the overseas natural sic resources development promotion law of the korean government  this contract shall be effected automatically during five years from the date of this contract provided that seller performs the contract faithfully without default  the quantity shall be increased upon sic  mt per year by the buyers order  the price shall be adjusted by mutual agreement every year prior to the next years delivery on the following basis a fob mine price shall be escalated on sic within  inflation rate in usa b transportation cost port charge and etc shall be reflected on sic actual cost covering the delivery year  ocean freight shall be adjusted by mutual agreement deerfield presented testimony at trial that one of the principal purposes of the addendum to the coal supply agreement was to clarify that nerco was bound to deerfield for the full five years of the korean contracts the coal supply agreement also provides section v  quality a coal specification  the quality of all coal delivered to buyer hereunder shall be such that it meets all of the specifications of exhibit a seller shall use its best efforts to provide coal that will not be subject to penalties as described in exhibit a such penalties to be sellers responsibility notwithstanding that both korean contracts specified  percent moisture as the beginning point for penalties nerco allegedly assured deerfield that the beginning point agreed upon by the koreans and applicable to the contract was in fact  percent moisture readings from  percent to  percent would thus actually qualify as  percent  to  is  percent and readings between  percent and  percent would qualify as  percent  to  is  percent nerco allegedly explained that the specifications as written in korean government contract forms could not be  changed but that performance tolerances were such that the alternative figures would govern regarding financing of the transaction the addendum provides  for the first two  ships of each of the said two  contracts nerco coal sales co shall provide to the mine supplier and truckers pursuant to deerfield commodities ltds contract with said mine supplier and truckers the required form of funding and guarantees specifically four  letters of credit one subsequent to the other each in the sum of  to be provided at the bank of deerfield commodities and keon coal co inc such letter of credit shall be provided when nerco receives acceptable nomination of vessel to carry the coal to be provided by deerfield the trial court admitted evidence that during early negotiations nerco proposed to pay  percent of the price on delivery of the silt at the mine sites and  percent after the ships were loaded but later preferred to provide a  line of credit and to pay the balance owed on receipt of payment from the koreans at the time that the contracts were signed however nerco allegedly agreed to provide all necessary financing for the first four ships with balances owed deerfield payable on receipt of payment from the koreans following execution of the contract on january  deerfield and nerco executed a fiveyear contract with the stevedores mj rudolph company additionally deerfield secured supplies bulldozers and loaders hired personnel and purchased modified and tested a  aggregate dryer for silt nerco did not secure a shipping contract however until march   deerfields evidence at trial showed that given the contract prices previously negotiated with the koreans and deerfield actual shipping costs reduced nercos projected profits to a minimum in early march nerco wrote to deerfield expressing concern about and demanding assurances of its ability to perform and threatening to take over its contracts with suppliers truckers and stevedores on receipt of that letter deerfield inquired about the motivation behind it and objected to what it considered unreasonable demands for assurances although nerco allegedly induced deerfield to reveal its sources by promising not to contact them by april  nerco had contacted and arranged for deerfields truckers and stevedores to work directly for it by march  deerfield had trucked over  tons of silt to dockside although the first ship fidias did not arrive until april  the moisture content of the first shipment as confirmed by nercos testing was  percent on the basis of those test results also submitted by nerco to the koreans for payment deerfield billed nerco for amounts owed nerco refused to pay claiming allegedly for the first time that the applicable moisture specification was  percent and that the  penalty imposed by the koreans eliminated any sums owed to deerfield deerfield objected to the enforcement of the  percent penalty provision because it understood that no penalties would be incurred unless the moisture content exceeded  percent it contended that the imposition of penalties only at levels exceeding  percent was discussed as late as april  during a meeting at which korean representatives were present after the first shipment  tons of coal silt remained at portside until the arrival of the second ship orient union on may  moisture readings on the second shipment were  percent with the excess over  percent allegedly attributable to rainfall during the delay in the arrival of  the ship a moisture penalty of  was assessed by the koreans with respect to that shipment deerfield refused to pay the penalties imposed by the koreans for the two shipments nerco in turn refused to pay deerfield for either shipment and terminated the contract between the parties after the departure of the orient union nerco sold ten more shipments of silt to the koreans in  for a sales price of  deerfield then commenced this action at the close of the  year the korean purchasers released nercos performance bonds and rejected nercos coal silt bids in  and also in  nerco presented evidence at trial that there was no korean market for coal silt in  before turning to the parties assignments of error it is necessary to summarize the bases of deerfields claims and of nercos counterclaims and thirdparty claims so that we may determine whether a new trial is proper and if so which if any of those claims must be retried in its first claim for relief deerfield alleged that nerco breached the parties contract in that it failed  to provide the required form of funding and guarantees  to pay monies owed for the two shipments delivered  to pay for additional coal supplied by deerfield and  to perform in good faith listing various instances for those breaches it sought damages of  in lost profits in its second claim for relief deerfield reiterated the claim for damages sought in its first claim alleging that nerco defrauded it by falsely representing that  coal supplied nerco having moisture content at levels in excess of those specified under the written contract would be acceptable  nerco would promptly provide all necessary funding and guarantees to purchase transport and load coal on the first four ships  nerco would provide timely and accurate notice of the arrival times of ships to enable deerfield to schedule delivery of coal with minimum moisture levels and  nerco would timely communicate and cooperate with deerfield concerning performance of all aspects of the coal supply agreement in addition to lost profits deerfield sought punitive damages of  for fraud in its third claim for relief deerfield sought  in damages for material misrepresentations based on the allegations set forth in the second claim for relief in its first affirmative defense and counterclaim nerco alleged that deerfield breached the parties contract by  failing to deliver coal which met the written moisture and calorific specifications  failing to deliver coal fobt until nerco paid for services and facilities  causing nerco to advance funds not required by the contract  failing to reimburse nerco for penalties  failing to complete assignment of coal leases and contracts to enable nerco to secure performance and  failing to perform in good faith listing various instances for those breaches nerco claimed to have been damaged in that it was assessed penalties of  for deerfields failure to deliver coal meeting specifications and incurred expenses of  in obtaining coal trucking and other services which were deerfields responsibility under the contract it also alleged that deerfield was liable for any  damages that nerco would be unable to mitigate in its second affirmative defense and counterclaim nerco alleged that deerfield defrauded it by falsely representing that it had coal leases sufficient to enable it to deliver  tons of coal silt before december   that the silt delivered would meet contract specifications and that it had the financial ability to obtain and deliver coal fobt it sought the relief requested in its first affirmative defense and counterclaim plus  in punitive damages in its third affirmative defense and counterclaim nerco sought damages of  and punitive damages of  alleging that deerfield defrauded it by falsely representing that it was required to purchase high quality coal from colleen coal company in order to meet contract specifications that the company was controlled by judges and politicians in pennsylvania that the price of coal was  per metric ton and that nerco had to post a letter of credit to colleen coal company to consummate the sale the gist of nercos thirdparty complaint is that such a unity of ownership existed between deerfield and thirdparty defendants that thirdparty defendants should be held liable for deerfields breach of contract and fraud it also alleged that deerfield and thirdparty defendants entered into a conspiracy to defraud nerco for which nerco was entitled to recover the damages sought in its first and third affirmative defenses and counterclaims and  in punitive damages the assignments of error on both the appeal and the crossappeal are concerned primarily with interpretation of the written agreement between the parties and the trial courts admission of evidence of what the parties intended the parties dispute the interpretation of the contract provisions relating to its duration applicable moisture content specifications and financing at the outset we note that the coal supply agreement provides that pennsylvania law governs its interpretation if however there is no apparent conflict between the relevant principles of pennsylvania and oregon law we are free to apply the latter see eg wl may co v philcoford corp  or   n   pd   erwin v thomas  or    pd   in this opinion we rely on pennsylvania law only when it appears that that law may be different from the oregon law or when there appears to be no applicable oregon law deerfields only assignment is that the trial court erred in concluding after judgment that the contract was unambiguously limited to a oneyear term it contends that the relevant provisions may be construed as providing for either a oneyear or a fiveyear term and that the issue of their construction was properly submitted to the jury accordingly it seeks reinstatement of the judgment based on the verdict in its favor as a general rule the construction of a contract is a question of law if the court determines that language of a contract is ambiguous evidence may be admitted relating to the intention of the parties and that question becomes one of fact timberline equip v st paul fire  mar ins  or    pd   a contract provision is ambiguous if it has no definite significance or if  it is capable of more than one sensible and reasonable interpretation it is unambiguous if its meaning is so clear as to preclude doubt by a reasonable person may v chicago insurance co  or   pd   oakridge cablevision v first interstate bank  or app   pd   in determining whether a contract is ambiguous parol evidence is admissible to explain the circumstances under which it was made although the evidence may not vary the terms of the written agreement it can place the judge in the position of those whose language is being interpreted ors  welch v us bancorp  or    pd   card v stirnweis  or    pd   taylors coffee shop v taylor  or app   pd  rev den  or   pd   deerfield contends that the language of the addendum specifying that deerfield shall be the source of product for both korean contracts can be read to imply that the fiveyear provision of those contracts governed the duration of the relationship between it and nerco it contends that the following circumstances surrounding and subsequent to the execution of the contract support that interpretation  precontractual negotiations evidencing that all participants sought a longterm commitment  nercos representation that a fiveyear commitment had been secured from the koreans  deerfields request that the addendum be drafted specifically to insure that nerco was bound to it for the full term of the korean contracts and  the parties execution of a fiveyear stevedoring contract with mj rudolph company nerco on the other hand contends that the language on which deerfield relies taken in context unambiguously provides that the parties were bound for only a oneyear term and argues that its interpretation is supported by the fact that the korean buyers discontinued dealings with nerco after the first year and released nercos performance bond in accordance with the contractual provisions that the bond be released after satisfactory completion of the contract or its expiry date we agree with the trial courts ultimate ruling that nercos interpretation is the correct one deerfield isolates one phrase of the addendum to support its argument that the contract is ambiguous on the question of duration however an examination of the entire contract and addendum negates that contention the relevant provision taken in context provides notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the above entitled contract the deerfield contract the parties agree  there are two  contracts fkxdhcc  and kfxdhcc  between hyosung corporation daeqonsa company ltd nerco coal sales co international fuel corporation each providing for an initial sale of  mtons of product  deerfield commodities ltd shall be the source of product for both contracts and all extensions thereof under the terms of the deerfield contract except as provided herein emphasis supplied those provisions can be read only as providing that two korean contracts existed that deerfield would be the source of silt for both contracts a clarification of the coal supply agreements mention of only the dai han contract and that it would supply silt for any extensions granted under the terms of the coal supply agreement  the recitation in paragraph b of the addendum that the price in section xxi option to extend shall be  rather than  is the only modification of the terms of the coal supply agreement to which the phrase in paragraph  except as provided herein can relate in determining the meaning of the contract we are required to consider the instrument as a whole rather than its isolated clauses sproul et al v gilbert et al  or    pd   state ex rel bakke v bakke  or app   pd   because both of the references in the addendum to the fouryear option to extend would be superfluous if the parties had intended to be bound for a fiveyear period the only reasonable interpretation of the emphasized provision is that they did not intend to be so bound neither were the long term clauses of the korean contracts specifically incorporated by reference into the parties agreement although the integration clause of the coal supply agreement provides that the terms of the dai han contract would apply hereto as they relate to seller deerfield that general language cannot be construed to override or conflict with the more specific provision of the agreement relating to the duration of the parties commitment see a sandblasting v baiden  or app    pd   affd  or   pd   the addendum simply provides that as to the hyosung contract deerfield shall comply with all obligations therein required by nerco as supplier of coal fob the parties are sophisticated corporations ie merchants see ors  and were represented by counsel in negotiating the terms of their agreement if they had intended that the long term clauses of the korean contracts would govern their relationship or that the agreement between them was for five years they could have expressly so provided the fact that they did neither indicates that section xxi of the contract means exactly what it says the contract was for one year with the buyer having an option to extend it for an additional four years indeed even if the long term clauses of the korean contracts had been incorporated by reference they do not support deerfields construction of the contract although the circumstances surrounding the execution of the deerfield contract suggest that the parties may have anticipated a longterm relationship with the korean buyers the terms of the korean contracts belie a firm fiveyear commitment each korean contract states that the amount purchased is  metric tons sets forth a schedule of shipments beginning in march and ending in december  and provides for liquidated damages keyed to a oneyear schedule the long term clauses expressly state that the buyers shall give a priority to the korean sellersupplier who has participated in mine andor silt operation through investment under the overseas natural resources development promotion law of the korean government there is no evidence that nerco was such a participant and thus would be given priority although the contract was to be effected automatically during five years from its date the quantity of coal silt was to be increased upon sic  mt per year by the buyers order price was to be adjusted each year by mutual agreement the applicable inflation rate for adjusting the fob mine price was simply left blank ocean freight which deerfield argued was a supply cost factor subject to considerable risk was also to be adjusted by mutual agreement the brief course of dealing between nerco and the korean buyers further suggests that both viewed their relationship as tentative after the first year moreover even the stevedoring  contract the execution of which deerfield contends indicates the parties fiveyear commitment states that nerco agreed to provide a minimum of  tons of silt for loading on the vessels over a fiveyear period because  tons of silt equalled the total amount nerco agreed to deliver during the first year under both korean contracts the execution of the stevedoring contract is not inconsistent with the parties understanding that they had a oneyear commitment with the possibility of a fouryear extension in short even reading the language of the addendum to mean that the korean contracts were incorporated in their entirety in the parties agreement the deerfield contract was not a fiveyear contract because the korean contracts were not having concluded that the contract was for one year the trial court properly granted nercos motion for a new trial we turn now to the question of whether the court erred in limiting the new trial solely to the issue of deerfields damages for a oneyear period nerco assigns  errors on crossappeal contending that the trial courts admission of extrinsic evidence and its instructions to the jury regarding the construction of the parties contract entitles it to an entirely new trial on whether it breached the oneyear contract and whether it is liable for misrepresentation and also on its counterclaims and thirdparty claims it groups its assignments respecting the courts rulings into three general subject areas  applicable moisture penalty specifications  nercos financing obligations and  deerfields theory of damages we consider them accordingly nercos first  assignments concern the trial courts rulings with respect to the applicable moisture penalty specifications of the parties agreement its first assignment however is a blanket assertion that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of alleged oral agreements contradicting any of the written contract provisions in violation of the parol evidence rule ors  which provides terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented  by course of dealing or usage of trade as provided in ors  or by course of performance as provided in ors  and  by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement the initial question is whether the coal supply agreement and the addendum thereto were intended by the parties as the final expression of their agreement and if so whether they were also intended as the parties complete and exclusive statement of their agreement deerfield contends that any relevant evidence is admissible to determine whether the agreement was a complete integration and that the parties discussions regarding moisture penalties and financing clearly evidence that it was not notwithstanding that evidence the coal supply agreement contains an integration clause and a separate clause expressly providing that any and all amendments supplements and modifications to this agreement shall be in writing the addendum executed the same day as the coal supply agreement was the only written modification of that agreement and was  prepared after all of the alleged statements that are inconsistent with the written contract were made the agreement therefore was the final one between the parties the language of the integration clause is that this document contains the entire agreement between the parties emphasis supplied that provision was not modified by the addendum although the ucc is silent on the matter in a noncommercial context at least one court applying pennsylvania law has held that such a provision creates a conclusive presumption that the agreement is fully integrated see united states gypsum co v schiavo bros inc  f supp   edpa  new trial granted  f supp  edpa  affd in part revd in part  fd  d cir cert den  us   s ct   l ed d   we conclude that the parties meant what they expressly provided in the integration and oral modification clauses the agreement was fully integrated although the relevant provisions of the korean contracts clearly provide for the imposition of penalties at moisture levels exceeding  and  percent and were incorporated in the contract by reference deerfield contends that the trial court properly admitted evidence of an oral understanding that penalties would begin at  and  percent rather than  and  percent under any one of several exceptions to the parol evidence rule first it maintains that that rule is inapplicable because nerco admitted at trial that there was an oral agreement between the parties even assuming that the evidence relied on by deerfield amounted to an admission deerfield misperceives the scope of the admission exception in devore v weyerhaeuser co  or    pd   cert den  us   s ct   l ed d   the court stated    the oral admissions of the plaintiff that the agreement included matters not contained in the writing may be proved to show that it was not assented to as a complete integration however complete it may look on its face    quoting  corbin contracts  §   emphasis supplied stated somewhat differently by the court in yuhas v schmidt  pa   ad    the rule is that where a party  seeking to have a written agreement enforced according to its terms admits in his own trial testimony that the agreement in writing did not fully and completely state the entire agreement between the parties then parol evidence is admissible to explain and supplement such written agreement    emphasis in original citations omitted as we understand the exception when a party admits to an oral agreement that is not inconsistent with the writing the written agreement may not represent the complete and exclusive statement of the parties under ors  consistent additional terms may then be admitted without a showing that the writing executed by the parties was not intended as their final expression however evidence contradicting the terms of the writing may not be introduced under the exception any other construction of that exception would be inconsistent with the courts ruling in hatley v stafford  or   pd   that the admission of parol evidence in cases involving the partial integration doctrine is limited by the requirement that the oral agreement be consistent with the written agreement and be made for separate consideration or be such as might naturally be made as a separate agreement by the parties because we have concluded that the agreement between the parties was fully integrated the evidence introduced at trial was inadmissible under the socalled admission exception because it contradicted the terms of the writing deerfields next contention is that evidence showing that  meant  and  meant  was admissible under the guise of interpretation it contends that when the parties adopt a special meaning or application  for particular terms of their agreement even    ordinary english words can be deprived of their ordinary meanings and supplied with others  even with meanings that are the exact opposite of their ordinary ones white can be made to mean black five can be made to mean ten  feet can be made to mean  inches and bunker hill monument can be made to signify old south church quoting  corbin contracts  §   although the drafters of the uniform commercial code apparently recognized the distinction between interpretation what the parties intended and construction whether the contract is ambiguous espoused by the treatise writers the final code provisions adopted limit the means whereby evidence of interpretation can be admitted ucc  codified in ors  provides that the terms of a completely integrated document may be explained or supplemented by three different means specifically evidence of  a course of dealing  a course of performance or  usage of the trade official comment c to ucc  expressly rejects the requirement that a condition precedent to the admissibility of that type of evidence is a determination by the court that the language used is ambiguous ors  provides the express terms of the agreement and any such course of performance as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other but when such construction is unreasonable express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealing and usage of trade reading the relevant statutory provisions with the commentary we conclude that although an integrated document need not be ambiguous before it may be supplemented or explained by evidence of the type mentioned above the document must nonetheless be reasonably susceptible to the interpretation suggested by the course of dealing course of performance or usage of the trade before that evidence is admissible ors  compels the same result by prohibiting evidence that contradicts the terms of an integrated agreement because the admission of deerfields evidence that  meant  and  meant  contradicted the clear provisions of the agreement it was inadmissible for the purposes of showing a course of performance course of dealing or trade usage the trial court erred in admitting that evidence in support of deerfields breach of contract claim the question remains whether it properly admitted that evidence in support of deerfields claim for material misrepresentation or fraud nerco contends that deerfields evidence of alternative moisture penalty specifications is inadmissible under the fraud or material misrepresentation exception to  the parol evidence rule because pennsylvania courts have limited the applicability of that exception to cases in which the alleged misrepresentations do not conflict with the written contractual provisions for that proposition it relies principally on the pennsylvania superior courts decision in ledonne v kessler  pasuper   ad   in ledonne purchasers of a home alleged that they signed an agreement in reliance on the vendors fraudulent representation that a sundeck and cellar did not leak water and that a drainage problem in the septic system had been repaired the agreement contained this provision the parties have full knowledge of the physical appearance of the land and buildings and of the value thereof and there are no verbal representations as to character or quality because the purchasers visual inspection of the property prior to the execution of the agreement revealed evidence of leakage in the sundeck and cellar the court concluded that they were not entitled to present evidence of the alleged representations stating at the time of executing the agreement of sale appellants had every reason to insist upon contractual protection against this readily discernible threat indeed even accepting their allegation that these assurances induced them to enter the contract appellants were particularly imprudent not to insist upon written contractual protection instead appellants signed an agreement in which they explicitly waived their right to rely upon any oral representations they may have received concerning the condition or quality of the physical premises    if we seriously desire to preserve the integrity of written contracts    then we must insist upon the application of the parol evidence rule when a party knows about the evidence of substantial problems yet contractually stipulates that he has received no promises about these problems rather than   allow circumvention of the substantive policies of the parol evidence rule by pleading niceties we should balance the extent of the partys knowledge of objectionable conditions derived from a reasonable inspection against the extent of the coverage of the contracts integration clause in order to determine whether that party could justifiably rely upon oral representations without insisting upon further contractual protection or the deletion of an overly broad integration clause  ad at  citations omitted because the purchasers could not discern the existence of the septic system problem through visual inspection alone however the court concluded that the contract did not bar the admission of the vendors alleged representations regarding that problem the pennsylvania superior courts more recent decision in abel v miller  pasuper   ad   indicates that the rule formulated in ledonne is not limited to cases involving the inspection of property in abel the parties entered into an agreement for the sale of real estate pursuant to that agreement the purchasers gave the vendors a nonnegotiable note in the amount of  payable at the time of settlement or as liquidated damages in the event of the purchasers default after the purchasers defaulted the seller sought arbitration and was awarded  plus interest the purchasers appealed to the court and in response to the  vendors motion for summary judgment moved to amend their answer to assert a new defense the motion was denied and the purchasers appealed to the superior court contending that they were entitled to amend their answer to allege that they had been fraudulently induced to enter into an agreement by the vendors representation that they could assume a promissory note which the vendors had given their predecessor in interest the agreement however specifically provided this agreement and buyers obligation to make settlement  a are not contingent upon buyers obtaining financing of any kind or receiving settlement for any other real estate  ad at  relying on ledonne the court held that because the written agreement specifically contradicted the representation on which the purchasers sought to rely in their new defense the lower court properly prohibited the amendment to their answer here the alleged representations regarding moisture penalties specifically contradict both the penalty provisions incorporated in the parties agreement and the provision that there are no other understandings representations or agreements between the parties if deerfield had intended to rely on oral representations that  meant  and  meant  it should have incorporated that agreement in its contract notwithstanding the express provisions of the korean contracts to the contrary it was not necessary to amend the korean contracts in order for deerfield and nerco to agree on when as between those parties the moisture penalties would be applicable because deerfield signed the contract directly conflicting with the alleged oral agreement and providing that there were no other agreements or representations it cannot rely on the fraud or material misrepresentation exception to the parol evidence rule at least under pennsylvania law therefore its claim for material misrepresentation must be retried other issues relating to damages on that claim are discussed later in this opinion nercos assignments of error thirteen through nineteen relate to the trial courts construction of the financing provision of the addendum which to reiterate provides  for the first two  ships of each of the said two  contracts nerco coal sales co shall provide to the mine supplier and truckers pursuant to deerfield commodities ltds contract with said mine supplier and truckers the required form of funding and guarantees specifically four  letters of credit one subsequent to the other each in the sum of  to be provided at the bank of deerfield commodities and keon coal co inc such letter of credit shall be provided when nerco receives acceptable nomination of vessel to carry the coal to be provided by deerfield nerco contends that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider evidence that nerco agreed to provide unlimited advance funding for all four ships because that evidence contradicts the express terms of the financing provision deerfield contends that the provision is ambiguous it argues that the language specifying that nerco shall provide the required form of funding and guarantees is susceptible to an interpretation that nercos obligation was not limited to providing letters of credit in the amount specified and that because there was no single contract with a mine supplier and truckers no single letter of credit would satisfy that obligation we hold that the language taken in context is not susceptible to the interpretation advanced by deerfield the phrase the required form of funding and guarantees is modified by the word specifically which means that what follows is a delineation of the scope of the obligation that there was more than one contract with truckers and suppliers would not change the extent of the specific obligation nerco undertook to perform insofar as deerfield is attempting to present evidence of consistent additional terms it is precluded from doing so by ors  given our  holding that the written agreement and addendum represent the parties complete and exclusive statement on the matter although deerfield is correct in contending that nercos conduct subsequent to the execution of the addendum qualifies as a course of performance admissible to determine the meaning of the agreement under ors  that nerco provided guarantees for stevedoring financing for coal sweetener and so forth cannot change the fact that the written agreement did not require those things neither can that conduct be construed as a waiver of any term of the writing under ors  as deerfield contends nerco did not have an obligation to provide additional financial assistance by so doing it neither increased nor contravened its contractual obligation we have concluded that the trial court did not err in holding that the agreement was limited to one year but that it erred in construing the contract provisions relating to moisture penalties and financial assistance and in admitting evidence that we have concluded should not have been admitted because the court submitted multiple contract claims and two claims for material misrepresentation to the jury it is not possible to determine from the verdict form on which claims the verdicts are based therefore all of the issues involved in plaintiffs breach of contract and misrepresentation claims and in defendants counterclaim and thirdparty claims for breach of contract must be retried one of the remaining assignments of error raises a question that is likely to arise on retrial of deerfields misrepresentation claim accordingly we address it nerco contends that deerfield is not entitled to lost profits for material misrepresentation because recovery under that tort theory traditionally has been limited to the difference between the value of what the injured party has parted with and the value of what he has received in the transaction restatement second torts § c  as deerfield points out however ucc §  codified in ors  provides remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under ors  to  for nonfraudulent breach neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale nor rejection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other remedy the official comment to ucc §  states that the remedies for fraud are extended by this section to coincide in scope with those for nonfraudulent breach nerco argues that notwithstanding the apparent statutory abrogation of the common law limitation oregon case law suggests that lost profits are not available in this case citing melms v mitchell  or   pd   and lanners v whitney  or   pd   those authorities do not support nercos contention whether lost profits should be recoverable for material misrepresentation is a question for the legislature  we need not consider assignments of error  through  in which nerco contends that there was insufficient evidence to submit a claim of lost profits to the jury and that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the method of calculating those profits because evidence of damages on retrial will be limited to deerfields lost profits for a oneyear period the issues raised in those assignments should not arise on remand the order granting a new trial limited solely to plaintiffs damages for one year is reversed remanded for new trial on plaintiffs breach of contract and material misrepresentation claims with damages if any limited to one year and on defendants counterclaims for breach of contract and defendants thirdparty claim based on that theory rossman judge concurring in part dissenting in part i commend the majority for its effort in this case i concur with virtually every aspect of its carefully researched and wellreasoned opinion however i take issue with the majoritys conclusion that evidence of defendants fraudulent representations concerning the moisture specifications were not admissible under the fraud exception to the parol evidence rule i do not believe that even pennsylvania law would allow defendants given their behavior in this case to hide behind the shield of the rule accordingly i dissent this record is full of testimony that defendants and the korean buyers had agreed to the higher moisture specifications on which plaintiff insisted notwithstanding the express terms of the korean contracts plaintiff claims that the higher specifications were a prerequisite to its participation in the transaction and that defendants representations that higher moisture percentages were tolerable induced it to enter into the contract nevertheless the majority concludes    if deerfield had intended to rely on oral representations that  meant  and  meant  it should have incorporated that agreement in its contract notwithstanding the express provisions of the korean contracts to the contrary it was not necessary to amend the korean contracts in order for deerfield and nerco to agree on when as between those parties the moisture penalties would be applicable because deerfield signed the contract directly conflicting with the alleged oral agreement and providing that there were no agreements or representations it cannot rely on the fraud or material misrepresentation exception to the parol evidence rule at least under pennsylvania law    majority opinion at  in reaching that conclusion it relies on two pennsylvania cases abel v miller  pa super   ad   and ledonne v kessler  pasuper   ad   which hold that the parol evidence rule bars the admission of evidence showing fraud in the inducement when the party seeking to introduce the evidence signed a contract that directly contradicts the oral representations the reason for the rule is obvious parties should protect themselves by conforming the written contract to the actual agreement i believe that the facts of this case take it outside the scope of the rule plaintiff was told by defendants that the korean contracts the ones containing the moisture specifications could not be changed to reflect the true agreement because the moisture specifications were set by the government and could never be varied in print although variations could be agreed to orally thus plaintiff attempted to protect itself but was induced by defendants fraudulently or otherwise to refrain from insisting that the contracts be changed the majority contends that even if the korean contracts could not be changed plaintiff could have inserted a clause in its contract with defendant detailing the separate oral agreement undoubtedly that would have been the best course of action however this court should not hold that plaintiffs failure to follow that course deprives it of relief from defendants fraud  on the contrary plaintiff exercised due care when it tried to change the korean contracts defendants explanation of why that was not possible combined with numerous assurances that the oral agreement was inviolate made plaintiffs actions wholly reasonable i would affirm the trial courts admission of the evidence notes  the parties stipulated that defendant nerco inc would be responsible for any liability of defendant nerco coal sales company resulting from this lawsuit accordingly both defendants will hereinafter be referred to collectively as nerco  although the parties appear to have met and signed the coal supply agreement and the addendum on january   the former document is dated january   the latter document begins addedum sic to

there would be no penalties for any moisture under  percent  although evidence at trial showed that nerco objected to the enforcement of the moisture penalty provisions by the koreans it decided ultimately not to contest the issue in arbitration under the terms of the korean contract  at the outset we reject third party defendants contention that nerco waived any appeal from the jury verdict on its crossclaims and counterclaims because none of its assignments or discussions relating thereto concern those claims although it is true that none of nercos assignments mentions its counterclaims or crossclaims the errors claimed affected the resolution not only of deerfields claims but also of nercos counterclaims and crossclaims for breach of contract however because the jury found against nerco on its fraud claims against deerfield and thirdparty defendants and because no error is assigned relating to those claims they are not before us  although the amended complaint does not specifically so state deerfields trial memoranda requested instructions and brief on appeal state that its claim for material misrepresentation was based on the theory that a false representation of a material fact although innocently made may be the ground for recovery of damages see lanners v whitney  or   pd    deerfield does not contend that the agreement may be interpreted unambiguously as a fiveyear contract neither does it contend that it may be interpreted as being a contract for more than one year but less than five years  the trial court instructed the jury as follows    where that contract involves repeated occasions for performance by either or both parties where the terms of a written contract are ambiguous or conflicting or their meaning is doubtful or obscured you should determine what the parties intended those terms to mean in resolving such an ambiguity if any you may consider the surrounding circumstances the situation of the parties the objects that they had in mind and the nature of the subject matter of the contract to ascertain the intention of the parties it appears that the court left it to the jury to determine whether the contract was ambiguous  deerfield attempted to prove at trial that the koreans discontinued dealings with nerco because of the latters consistent failure to perform according to specifications under the terms of the korean contracts however in the event that nerco failed to make deliveries of the coal within the time specified to perform faithfully and contractual conditions sic the koreans could unilaterally rescind the contract and require forfeiture of nercos performance bond which they did not do  in fact deerfields principal william ohare is a lawyer and was present throughout the negotiations  nerco presented evidence at trial showing that after the execution of the stevedoring contract it immediately notified mj rudolph co that its agent lacked authority to enter a fiveyear contract or any other terminalling contract for nerco it also reprimanded the agent for his unauthorized act the terminalling agreement ultimately entered into between rudolph and nerco provided for a oneyear term with an option to extend it for four years the option was never exercised  ors  contains a similar provision the express terms of an agreement and an applicable course of dealing or usage of trade shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other but when such construction is unreasonable express terms control both course of dealing and usage of trade and course of dealing controls usage of trade  the exception is generally stated as follows the parol evidence rule does not become applicable unless    the parties have assented to a writing or writings as the statement of the agreement or contract between them accordingly it may be shown by parol evidence not only that a writing was never executed or delivered as a contract but also that the validity of the agreement was impaired by fraud illegality duress mistake lack of or failure of consideration rendering the agreement voidable or void  williston contracts  §   emphasis supplied accord  corbin contracts  §   some commentators have suggested that the socalled fraud exception should not be used to admit evidence when the court concludes that a misrepresentation is wholly innocent see white  summers uniform commercial code §§   however pennsylvania courts appear to consider material misrepresentation as a species of fraud to which the exception applies see berger v pittsburgh auto equip co  pa   ad    glanski v ervine  pasuper   ad     contrary to deerfields contention nerco did not waive the right to contest the admission of the evidence on the contract claim by failing to request an instruction limiting that evidence to the fraud and material misrepresentation claims our examination of nercos assignments infra convinces us that its motion for a directed verdict was improperly denied at least as to deerfields specification that nerco failed to provide the necessary form of funding and guarantees because the jury improperly considered that specification in returning a verdict on the entire contract claim nerco is entitled to a retrial of that claim regardless of its failure to request a limiting instruction  ors  provides  where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall

dealing and usage of trade  subject to the provisions of ors  on modification and waiver such course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with
