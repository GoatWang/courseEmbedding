download andor upload each month most of our available service plans come with a generous monthly usage allowance—and the majority of customers stay well within those parameters the only reason anyone would see an extra usage charge on their monthly statement is if they exceeded the monthly allowance included in their plan use these tools to help estimate your data usage for mobile internet or rural broadband find out staying on track you can view your internet data usage online—or even get email notifications if you’re approaching or exceeding your usage threshold on your residential accounts you can find helpful information and details on how to access that personal usage viewer tool on our support site and of course if you have any questions about usage or your plan please don’t hesitate to give us a call  in anchorage or  statewide included usage to provide you with quality affordable service most of our service plans offer a generous amount of included usage most customers do not exceed the amount of monthly included amount but if you do usage is billed at your plan’s overage rate some gci plans were previously defined as “unlimited downloads” which means that gci did not automatically invoice usage over a defined threshold however all “unlimited download” plans are still subject to fair and reasonable use as outlined in our terms of service  included usage allowances in our service plans assure affordable and reliable service for all customers these plans are designed to meet the speed and usage needs of our individual customers and most should not expect to exceed the monthly included amount of usage andor the amount defined in the fair use policy as applicable a small number of customers use substantially more of the network than is intended for their service plan left unchecked this usage could affect the experience and cost to all customers gci believes the fairest approach to keep the costs down for all customers is to ensure that customers are on service plans that best match their needs and where applicable assess modest charges for those with usage above their intended plan levels related articles fair use policy data usage
