was born in the achrafieh neighborhood of beirut on  november  the youngest of six children the gemayel family originated from bikfaya village in the matn district of lebanon and is one of the most influential christian families in the country his father was pierre gemayel who founded the phalange party in  as a youth movement bachir gemayel attended the jesuit collège notre dame de jamhour and the institution moderne du liban iml fanar he completed his university education at st joseph university université saintjoseph  usj in beirut after teaching for three years at the lebanese modern institute he graduated in  with a bachelors degree in law and another in political sciences in  in  gemayel studied at the center for american and international law near dallas texas in the united states qualifying in  he joined the bar association and opened an office in hamra street west beirut early activities in the kataeb partyedit bachir became a member of the kataeb party´s youth section when he was  years old bachir realized the dangers that surrounded lebanon in  so he spent a lot of time with the organized political wing of the kataeb party he attended the meetings organized by the kataeb student section and he was the president of the kataeb circle in st joseph university between  and  in the late 0s he underwent paramilitary training in bikfaya and he was appointed squad leader of a militia unit of the kataeb regulatory forces  krf the partys military wing formed in  then in the early 0s he formed the “bikfaya squad” within the rkf where he became acquainted with the basics of military combat in  he participated in a student colloquium organized by the newspaper orient following events which occurred across lebanese universities between the muslim and leftist panarabist students supporting the palestinians in lebanon on one side and lebanese christian nationalist phoenicist students whom bachir represented on the other after the  clashes between the lebanese army and the plo bachir gathered a group of christian students and started training them in the kataebrun tabrieh training camp located near bsharri in the keserwan district mountains this was the start of what would later become the lebanese forces at this stage he was a junior militia commander under the orders of william hawi the founder and head of the krf bachir with his father pierre bachir with kataeb regulatory forces militiamen in 0 bachir was briefly kidnapped by palestinian militants in lebanon and taken to the tel alzaatar refugee camp he was released  hours later bachir became a member of the “bg squad” formed by william hawi he was a revolutionary in the party he became close with jean nader the leader of achrafieh at that time and became the vice president of that lebanese capital district a position that he held from  till  bachir became the head of the “bg squad” after its members found him as a leader more close to their views this group was formed of  specially trained members such as fouad abou nader fadi frem elie hobeika and others they were fierce fighters and they were known for their violent performance in the field this group was out of the direct control of the party he had his own views and principles and he wanted to run for the vice presidency of the party but his men said to him that they want him as the leader of the “lebanese forces” and not the vp of a party in addition many members of the party did not want him as the vp because he was the son of pierre gemayel the founder and president of the party the elections were cancelled and did not take place until after his assassination he submitted his resignation from the party in  but it was rejected this was because the kataeb party had approved the entrance of the syrian army to lebanon to put an end to the war but bachir refused to accept this being strongly against the syrian intervention because he believed that syria wanted to annex lebanon he came to this conclusion because the syrian officials repeatedly stated that lebanon is part of syria and that the syrian army doesn’t need anyone’s permission to enter lebanon moreover at that time the syrian educational system used to teach that lebanon is a syrian district military commandedit conflict with the ploedit in  gemayel was accused by the lnm of being responsible for the black saturday massacre of palestinians and lebanese muslims according to phalange member karim pakradouni bachir admitted to him that while being in an emotional state for the killing of four phalangists earlier that day he ordered his militiamen into the streets bachir added that when the situation developed into something he did not agree with and civilians were being killed he tried to stop the killings but failed to however according to michel samaha another phalange member bachir was outside beirut arriving after the killing of civilians had started michel samaha added that bachir was one of the many senior members of the phalange party who tried to stop this massacre bachir in the street christian east beirut was ringed by heavily fortified palestinian camps from which kidnappings and sniping against lebanese civilians became a daily routine christian east beirut became besieged by the plo camps with severe shortages of food and fuel this unbearable situation led the kataeb forces and their allied christian militias to besiege the palestinian camps embedded in christian east beirut one at a time and bring them down on january   bachir led the invasion of the heavily fortified karantina camp that was located near the strategic beirut harbor about 0 plo fighters and civilians were killed the palestinian plo and assaiqa forces retaliated by attacking the isolated defenseless christian town of damour about  miles south of beirut on the coast during the damour massacre in which 0 christian civilians were killed and 0 were sent fleeing north by boat since all roads were blocked off the maronites retaliated with the invasion of the tel alzaatar camp that same year the camp was placed under siege for  days by the tigers militia led by dany chamoun bachir played an important role in the last stages of the battle he sent a group of his forces that moved through the sewers and they blew up the ammunition storage in the camp this incident was considered to be the lethal blow that led the fall of the camp the christian militias also fought against the plo and lnm militias at the battle of the hotels in central beirut bachir led the battle for the holiday inn that had an important strategic location the battle was a success for bachirs troops and they were able to move the plo out of the hotel after insuring the safety of the rear lines and their effectiveness necessary for the safety of christian east beirut bachir and his troops decided to abandon the hotel bachir attending mass at a training camp in  with the death of william hawi killed by a sniper during the battle of tall alzaatar bachir became head of the kataeb regulatory forces militia later that year he became a leading member of the lebanese front a coalition of several christian parties and commander of their military wing the lebanese forces a military coalition of several christian militias which not only opposed the plo but also the syrian army presence who had entered lebanon at first to assist in defeating palestinian militants before turning into occupiers bachir giving a speech at don bosco training camp bachir led his troops in the infamous “hundred days war” in lebanon in  in which the lebanese forces successfully resisted the syrian shelling and attacking of eastern beirut for about three months before an arabbrokered agreement forced the syrians to end

the sodeco area in achrafieh where the lebanese forces fought ferociously and led the syrian army out of the rizk building this war led to the withdrawal of the syrian troops from east beirut and the free christian areas at this time israel was the primary backer of the lebanese front’s militia in  at zahlé in the beqaa the largest christian town in the east confronted one of the biggest battles –

lebanese forces commandos returned to beirut on  july  see battle of zahleh for more details tensions within the lebanese frontedit bachir with camille chamoun despite its increasing success in its battles against the plo and the syrian troops two factors led to the eventual demise of the lebanese front following the killing of many phalangist members in addition to a senior phalangist by members of the marada brigade militia which was led by a fellow member of the lebanese front tony frangieh bachir called for a meeting to decide on what to do about this situation at first the decision was to capture tony frangieh and force him to surrender the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists however there was concern about the consequences of this move so the decision was changed after many talks between the phalangists present at the meeting it was decided that the goal of the operation would be to capture the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists and it would be done on tuesday to be sure that tony frangieh would have finished his weekend vacation and left ehden on  june  bachir sent a squadron of his men led by samir geagea and elie hobeika to ehden but what bachir did not know is that tony frangieh never left ehden since his car did not work as soon as the squadron arrived bullets were flying all over their heads so they retaliated and this led to the killing of tony frangieh and his family in addition to tens of members of the marada militia the incident is known as the ehden massacre bachir was very angry about what happened but he stood by his men  in 0 in order to stop the clashes happening inside the christian areas between the kataeb militia and the tigers militia and in order to eliminate the possibility of an intrachristian war bachir sent his troops to the town of safra where dany chamoun and members of his tigers militia were vacationing the tigers under the control of elias el hannache were exterminated in what was later named safra massacre danys life was spared and he sought refuge in west beirut but camille chamouns support of the attack was interpreted as him believing that his son’s militia was getting too out of control israeli invasion of lebanon and bachirs electionedit israel invaded lebanon in  defense minister of israel ariel sharon met with bachir months earlier telling him that the israeli defense force were planning an invasion to uproot the plo threat to israel and to move them out of lebanon while bachir did not control israel’s actions in lebanon the support israel gave the lebanese forces militarily and politically angered many lebanese leftists bachir met with hani al hassan representative of the plo and told him that israel would enter and wipe them out bachir told him to leave lebanon peacefully before it was too late hani left and no reply was given to bachir celebrations in sassine square after bachirs election bachir with philip habib who played an important role in bachirs election israel invaded and the plo were expelled from lebanon in august  during the invasion the israelis wanted the lebanese forces to assist the israeli army militarily by fighting the palestinians and muslims in west beirut however bachir refused that because he said that his forces would not assist an invading army by now bachir had announced his candidacy for president he was backed by the united states who sent peacekeeping troops to oversee the withdrawal of the plo from lebanon bachir had requested that they stay longer to keep lebanon stable until he could reunite it but his request was denied the mossad also contributed to his presidency on  august  being the only one to declare his bid bachir was elected president on  september  two weeks before his assassination and only one week after his election bachir met the israeli prime minister menachem begin in nahariya during the meeting begin demanded that bachir sign a peace treaty with israel as soon as he took office in return of israels earlier support of lebanese forces and he also told bachir that the idf would stay in south lebanon if the peace treaty wasnt signed bachir was furious at begin and told him that the lebanese forces didnt fight for seven years and that they didnt sacrifice thousands of soldiers to free lebanon from the syrian army and the plo so that israel can take their place bachir also added that he will not sign the peace treaty without national consensus on the matter begin was reportedly angry at bachir for his public denial of israels support bachir refused signing a peace treaty arguing that time is needed to reach consensus with lebanese muslims and the arab nations this angered the israelis because they knew that it is almost impossible for the lebanese muslims to agree on a peace treaty they realized that bachir was starting to distance himself from them on  september  in an attempt to fix the relations between begin and bachir ariel sharon had a secret meeting with bachir in bikfaya during the meeting bachir told sharon that the lebanese army would soon enter into the palestinian camps to disarm any remaining fighters they also agreed that the lebanese army would attack the syrian armys positions in lebanon assisted by the israeli army in addition sharon tried to convince bachir about signing a peace treaty but bachir did not change his position on this matter bachir had planned to use the idf to push the syrian army out of lebanon and then use his relations with the americans to pressure the

assassinated habib shartouni a member of the syrian social nationalist party and also a maronite christian was later arrested for the assassination his sister was living in the apartment above the room bachir was in he had visited her the previous day and planted the bomb in her apartment the next day he called her and told her to get out of the building once she was out he detonated the bomb from a few miles away from the building when he came back to check on his sister he was immediately arrested he later confessed to it saying he had done this because “bachir had sold the country to israel” a reporter was heard telling him you didnt kill a man you killed a country he was imprisoned for  years until syrian troops took over lebanon at the end of the war and freed him on  october  amine gemayel did not condemn habib shartouni because of immense syrian pressure various theories exist as to other parties that had a hand in the assassination many point fingers at the syrian government and thensyrian president hafez alassad for having knowledge of the assassination attempt and for backing shartouni even after they kept pressuring him bachir refused to immediately give israel peace aftermathedit condemnations poured in from around the world including from the united nations security council in resolution  as well as from american president ronald reagan reagan had been one of bachirs most staunch supporters saying this promising young leader had brought the light of hope to lebanon bachir gemayels older brother amine gemayel was then elected as president serving from  to  rather different in temperament amine gemayel was widely regarded as more moderate than his brother many of bachirs followers were dissatisfied with amine eventually the lebanese forces became independent from the phalange and its own political party sabra and shatila massacreedit main article sabra and shatila massacre the sabra and shatila massacre was the killing of between  and  civilians mostly palestinians and lebanese shiites by a militia close to the kataeb party also called phalange a predominantly christian lebanese rightwing party in the sabra neighborhood and the adjacent shatila refugee camp in beirut lebanon the massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of newly elected lebanese president bachir gemayel the leader of the lebanese kataeb party legacyedit throughout the postwar period the cult of bashir gemayel was the most visible commemorative phenomenon in parts of beirut especially ashrafieh the leader of lf is revered with a

widow solange gemayel works to keep his legacy alive through the bachir gemayel foundation a political and informational organization bachirs eldest daughter maya was murdered on  february 0 at  months of age by a car bomb intended for her father he had two surviving children his second daughter youmna was born later in the year and received her degree in political science in paris she is now working towards her masters in management at esa école supérieure des affaires in beirut gemayels son nadim who was born a few months before bachir was killed was a law student and political activist and was elected as a member of the lebanese parliament in  political viewsedit on relationship with the united statesedit the relations between lebanon and the united states had a high priority rating on gemayel’s agenda and occupied a sizeable portion of his time and efforts bachir gemayel believed that the us and lebanon are natural allies since they enjoy a common cultural affinity similar ideological beliefs free economic systems and strong commitment to human rights and dignity he believed in the us leadership of the free world and he was confident that washington would strengthen its ties to lebanon the lebanese people he declared do not wish that their american friends fight their battle and suffer casualties however they look to the us for economic and military aid so that they themselves may free their country when alexander haig us state secretary subsequently declared that the fact of restoring peace and security to lebanon would achieve the same result for all the countries of the region bashir wholeheartedly agreed with him and supported the new policy of the united states saying  “mr alexander haig is quite right in proclaiming this new attitude loud and clear in fact that its exactly what we have been saying for the past seven years” bashir did not minimize the role of the lebanese communities in the usa  he considered that his fellowlebanese living in the united states had an important role to play and distinguished two stages in this context  the first stage in which the lebanese overseas communities would not play any role at all ie the passive stage and a positive stage in which they would promote the cause of their father land and lobby for a modification in us foreign policy dealing with lebanon he said  “two years ago we were not present in the american forum the palestinians have their lobby so do the jews the kurds and the copts as for us whenever a representative of this country goes to the states it is usually to collect donations to fix the belfry of such or such a church or to obtain a grant for some school or other in a village but when our presence there became larger people began to sit up and take interest in the lebanese cause” bashir’s approach was not limited to this alone  he called for an efficient reorganiztion of the overseas lebanese collectivities in the united states because according to his views they represented a nonnegligible source of political and financial power he suggested  “there is a vital necessity to reorganize the groups of lebanese emigrants in a practical and modern manner in order to create our own lobby to promote the cause of our country in america we cannot ignore the fact that the united states constitute the world’s center of gravity and that their influence in the middleeast conflict is preponderant” he stressed the importance of maintaining the best relations with the united states particularly in lebanon itself through the medium of us ambassador philip habib and the united states’ embassy in beirut no effort must be neglected to enlist the active political support of the greatest nation in the world for the lebanese cause bashir was confident that such good relations existed already “we entertain excellent relations with philip habib with the united states’ embassy in beirut and with the state department in washington through our offices abroad we enjoy close relations with all the centers of power and gravity throughout the world” with regard to ambassador philip habib’s mission in lebanon bashir expressed the wish to see these efforts continue  “i hope that ambassador habib’s mission here will be pursued until we clear up all our problems with his help in our present predicament we lebanese are in dire need of friendship from abroad to assist up in overcoming our difficulties and help us stand on our feet again” on relationship with european countriesedit relations between lebanon and the european states deteriorated because the latter also tried to solve the middleeast problem at the expense of lebanon in addition to this factor many european countries had adopted the obsequious policy of fawning on the arab states in order to secure their oil supplies this was done of course at the expense of the christians of their security their very existence bashir referred to both these factors in one of his speeches  “europe and many other states are not able to digest the christian presence in this corner of the world because it is a stumblingblock to most of their ambitions in this area the americans and the west have not yet assimilated the fact that we the christians of the orient represent their last line of defense against a return to the dark ages against terror and blind fundamentalism against those who seek to annihilate all the values of civilization and of their culture today they want to ‘sell us down the river’ for a barrel of oil” arab countriesedit gemayel firmly believed that lebanon has a great role to play in emancipation of the arab world but that lebanon must be respected and trusted as an equal and be free of foreign intervention including arab intervention and that arab governments must understand that lebanon is a sovereign state and has right to reject any policy contrary to its national interests he warned the arab world not to exploit the friendship and cooperation of the lebanese people by attempting to settle middle east conflicts at lebanons expense he acknowledged however that during his visit to taef he was advised by his saudi hosts that they understand lebanons problems and position on the plo and syria saudi leaders publicly lauded him for his leadership and vision gemayel insisted in his talks that the plo and syrian armed presence in lebanon is not negotiable or open for compromise since it undermines lebanons sovereignty which cannot be divided among nonlebanese armies he also praised the efforts deployed by saudi arabia and kuwait in helping lebanon and he called for stronger relations with these two countries the lebanese people he declared will reserve a special friendship for the saudis and their arab friends

achrafieh neighborhood of beirut on  november  the youngest of six children the gemayel family originated from bikfaya village in the matn district of lebanon and is one of the most influential christian families in the country his father was pierre gemayel who founded the phalange party in  as a youth movement bachir gemayel attended the jesuit collège notre dame de jamhour and the institution moderne du liban iml fanar he completed his university education at st joseph university université saintjoseph  usj in beirut after teaching for three years at the lebanese modern institute he graduated in  with a bachelors degree in law and another in political sciences in  in  gemayel studied at the center for american and international law near dallas texas in the united states qualifying in  he joined the bar association and opened an office in hamra street west beirut early activities in the kataeb partyedit bachir became a member of the kataeb party´s youth section when he was  years old bachir realized the dangers that surrounded lebanon in  so he spent a lot of time with the organized political wing of the kataeb party he attended the meetings organized by the kataeb student section and he was the president of the kataeb circle in st joseph university between  and  in the late 0s he underwent paramilitary training in bikfaya and he was appointed squad leader of a militia unit of the kataeb regulatory forces  krf the partys military wing formed in  then in the early 0s he formed the “bikfaya squad” within the rkf where he became acquainted with the basics of military combat in  he participated in a student colloquium organized by the newspaper orient following events which occurred across lebanese universities between the muslim and leftist panarabist students supporting the palestinians in lebanon on one side and lebanese christian nationalist phoenicist students whom bachir represented on the other after the  clashes between the lebanese army and the plo bachir gathered a group of christian students and started training them in the kataebrun tabrieh training camp located near bsharri in the keserwan district mountains this was the start of what would later become the lebanese forces at this stage he was a junior militia commander under the orders of william hawi the founder and head of the krf bachir with his father pierre bachir with kataeb regulatory forces militiamen in 0 bachir was briefly kidnapped by palestinian militants in lebanon and taken to the tel alzaatar refugee camp he was released  hours later bachir became a member of the “bg squad” formed by william hawi he was a revolutionary in the party he became close with jean nader the leader of achrafieh at that time and became the vice president of that lebanese capital district a position that he held from  till  bachir became the head of the “bg squad” after its members found him as a leader more close to their views this group was formed of  specially trained members such as fouad abou nader fadi frem elie hobeika and others they were fierce fighters and they were known for their violent performance in the field this group was out of the direct control of the party he had his own views and principles and he wanted to run for the vice presidency of the party but his men said to him that they want him as the leader of the “lebanese forces” and not the vp of a party in addition many members of the party did not want him as the vp because he was the son of pierre gemayel the founder and president of the party the elections were cancelled and did not take place until after his assassination he submitted his resignation from the party in  but it was rejected this was because the kataeb party had approved the entrance of the syrian army to lebanon to put an end to the war but bachir refused to accept this being strongly against the syrian intervention because he believed that syria wanted to annex lebanon he came to this conclusion because the syrian officials repeatedly stated that lebanon is part of syria and that the syrian army doesn’t need anyone’s permission to enter lebanon moreover at that time the syrian educational system used to teach that lebanon is a syrian district military commandedit conflict with the ploedit in  gemayel was accused by the lnm of being responsible for the black saturday

that day he ordered his militiamen into the streets bachir added that when the situation developed into something he did not agree with and civilians were being killed he tried to stop the killings but failed to however according to michel samaha another phalange member bachir was outside beirut arriving after the killing of civilians had started michel samaha added that bachir was one of the many senior members of the phalange party who tried to stop this massacre bachir in the street christian east beirut was ringed by heavily fortified palestinian camps from which kidnappings and sniping against lebanese civilians became a daily routine christian east beirut became besieged by the plo camps with severe shortages of food and fuel this unbearable situation led the kataeb forces and their allied christian militias to besiege the palestinian camps embedded in christian east beirut one at a time and bring them down on january   bachir led the invasion of the heavily fortified karantina camp that was located near the strategic beirut harbor about 0 plo fighters and civilians were killed the palestinian plo and assaiqa forces retaliated by attacking the isolated defenseless christian town of damour about  miles south of beirut on the coast during the damour massacre in which 0 christian civilians were killed and 0 were sent fleeing north by boat since all roads were blocked off the maronites retaliated with the invasion of the tel alzaatar camp that same year the camp was placed under siege for  days by the tigers militia led by dany chamoun bachir played an important role in the last stages of the battle he sent a group of his forces that moved through the sewers and they blew up the ammunition storage in the camp this incident was considered to be the lethal blow that led the fall of the camp the christian militias also fought against the plo and lnm militias at the battle of the hotels in central beirut bachir led the battle for the holiday inn

the sodeco area in achrafieh where the lebanese forces fought ferociously and led the syrian army out of the rizk building this war led to the withdrawal of the syrian troops from east beirut and the free christian areas at this time israel was the primary backer of the lebanese front’s militia in  at zahlé in the beqaa the largest christian town in the east confronted one of the biggest battles – both military and political – between the lebanese forces and the syrian occupying forces the lebanese forces were able to confront them and reverse the result of the battle of  with the help of

members of the marada brigade militia which was led by a fellow member of the lebanese front tony frangieh bachir called for a meeting to decide on what to do about this situation at first the decision was to capture tony frangieh and force him to surrender the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists however there was concern about the consequences of this move so the decision was changed after many talks between the phalangists present at the meeting it was decided that the goal of the operation would be to capture the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists and it would be done on tuesday to be sure that tony frangieh would have finished his weekend vacation and left ehden on  june  bachir sent a squadron of his men led by samir geagea and elie hobeika to ehden but what bachir did not know is that tony frangieh never left ehden since his car did not work as soon as the squadron arrived bullets were flying all over their heads so they retaliated and this led to the killing of tony frangieh and his family in addition to tens of members of the marada militia the incident is known as the ehden massacre bachir was very angry about what happened but he stood by his men  in 0 in order to stop the clashes happening inside the christian areas between the kataeb militia and the tigers militia and in order to eliminate the possibility of an intrachristian war bachir sent his troops to the town of safra where dany chamoun and members of his tigers militia were vacationing the tigers under the control of elias el hannache were exterminated in what was later named safra massacre danys life was spared and he sought refuge in west beirut but camille chamouns support of the attack was interpreted as him believing that his son’s militia was getting too out of control israeli invasion of lebanon and bachirs electionedit israel invaded lebanon in  defense minister of israel ariel sharon met with bachir months earlier telling him that the israeli defense force were planning an invasion to uproot the plo threat to israel and to move them out of lebanon while bachir did not control israel’s actions in lebanon the support israel gave the lebanese forces militarily and politically angered many lebanese leftists bachir met with hani al hassan representative of the plo and told him that israel would enter and wipe them out bachir told him to leave lebanon peacefully before it was too late hani left and no reply was given to bachir celebrations in sassine square after bachirs election bachir with philip habib who played an important role in bachirs election israel invaded and the plo were expelled from lebanon in august  during the invasion the israelis wanted the lebanese forces to assist the israeli army militarily by fighting the palestinians and muslims in west beirut however bachir refused that because he said that his forces would not assist an invading army by now bachir had announced his candidacy for president he was backed by the united states who sent peacekeeping troops to oversee the withdrawal of the plo from lebanon bachir had requested that they stay longer to keep lebanon stable until he could reunite it but his request was denied the mossad also contributed to his presidency on  august  being the only one to declare his bid bachir was elected president on  september  two weeks before his assassination and only one week after his election bachir met the israeli prime minister menachem begin in nahariya during the meeting begin demanded that bachir sign a peace treaty with israel as soon as he took office in return of israels earlier support of lebanese forces and he also told bachir that the idf would stay in south lebanon if the peace treaty wasnt signed bachir was furious at begin and told him that the lebanese forces didnt fight for seven years and that they didnt sacrifice thousands of soldiers to free lebanon from the syrian army and the plo so that israel can take their place bachir also added that he will not sign the peace treaty without national consensus on the matter begin was reportedly angry at bachir for his public denial of israels support bachir refused signing a peace treaty arguing that time is needed to reach consensus with lebanese muslims and the arab nations this angered the israelis because they knew that it is almost impossible for the lebanese muslims to agree on a peace treaty they realized that bachir was starting to distance himself from them on  september  in an attempt to fix the relations between begin and bachir ariel sharon had a secret meeting with bachir in bikfaya during the meeting bachir told sharon that the lebanese army would soon enter into the palestinian camps to disarm any remaining fighters they also agreed that the lebanese army would attack the syrian armys positions in lebanon assisted by the israeli army in addition sharon tried to convince bachir about signing a peace treaty but bachir did not change his position on this matter bachir had planned to use the idf to push the syrian army out of lebanon and then use his relations with the americans to pressure the

from a few miles away from the building when he came back to check on his sister he was immediately arrested he later confessed to it saying he had done this because “bachir had sold the country to israel” a reporter was heard telling him you didnt kill a man you killed a country he was imprisoned for  years until syrian troops took over lebanon at the end of the war and freed him on  october  amine gemayel did not condemn habib shartouni because of immense syrian pressure various theories exist as to other parties that had a hand in the assassination many point fingers at the syrian government and thensyrian president hafez alassad for having knowledge of the assassination attempt and for backing shartouni even after they kept pressuring him bachir refused to immediately give israel peace aftermathedit condemnations poured in from around the world including from the united nations security council in resolution  as well as from american president ronald reagan reagan had been one of bachirs most staunch supporters saying this promising young leader had brought the light of hope to lebanon bachir gemayels older brother amine gemayel was then elected as president serving from  to  rather different in temperament amine gemayel was widely regarded as more moderate than his brother many of bachirs followers were dissatisfied with amine eventually the lebanese forces became independent from the phalange and its own political party sabra and shatila massacreedit main article sabra and shatila massacre the sabra and shatila massacre was the killing of between  and  civilians mostly palestinians and lebanese shiites by a militia close to the kataeb party also called phalange a predominantly christian lebanese rightwing party in the sabra neighborhood and the adjacent shatila refugee camp in beirut lebanon the massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of newly elected lebanese president bachir gemayel the leader of the lebanese kataeb party legacyedit throughout the postwar period the cult of bashir gemayel was the most visible commemorative phenomenon in parts of beirut especially ashrafieh the leader of lf is revered with a wealth of different signs ranging from spraypainted profiles and posters in the public space of the entry hall of beiruts old jesuit university university saintjoseph personal lifeedit bachir gemayels widow solange gemayel works to keep his legacy alive through the bachir gemayel foundation a political and informational organization bachirs eldest daughter maya was murdered on  february 0 at  months of age by a car bomb intended for her father he had two surviving children his second daughter youmna was born later in the year and received her degree in political science in paris she is now working towards her masters in management at esa école supérieure des affaires in beirut gemayels son nadim who was born a few months before bachir was killed was a law student and political activist and was elected as a member of the lebanese parliament in  political viewsedit on relationship with the united statesedit the relations between lebanon and the united states had a high priority rating on gemayel’s agenda and occupied a sizeable portion of his time and efforts bachir gemayel believed that the us and lebanon are natural allies since they enjoy a common cultural affinity similar ideological beliefs free economic systems and strong commitment to human rights and dignity he believed in the us leadership of the free world and he was confident that washington would strengthen its ties to lebanon the lebanese people he declared do not wish that their american friends fight their battle and suffer casualties however they look to the us for economic and military aid so that they themselves may free their country when alexander haig us state secretary subsequently declared that the fact of restoring peace and security to lebanon would achieve the same result for all the countries of the region bashir wholeheartedly agreed with him and supported the new policy of the united states saying  “mr alexander haig is quite right in proclaiming this new attitude loud and clear in fact that its exactly what we have been saying for the past seven years” bashir did not minimize the role of the lebanese communities in the usa  he considered that his fellowlebanese living in the united states had an important role to play and distinguished two stages in this context  the first stage in which the lebanese overseas communities would not play any role at all ie the passive stage and a positive stage in which they would promote the cause of their father land and lobby for a modification in us foreign policy dealing with lebanon he said  “two years ago we were not present in the american forum the palestinians have their lobby so do the jews the kurds and the copts as for us whenever a representative of this country goes to the states it is usually to collect donations to fix the belfry of such or such a church or to obtain a grant for some school or other in a village but when our presence there became larger people began to sit up and take interest in the lebanese cause” bashir’s approach was not limited to this alone  he called for an efficient reorganiztion of the overseas lebanese collectivities in the united states because according to his views they represented a nonnegligible source of political and financial power he suggested  “there is a vital necessity to reorganize the groups of lebanese emigrants in a practical and modern manner in order to create our own lobby to promote the cause of our country in america we cannot ignore the fact that the united states constitute the world’s center of gravity and that their influence in the middleeast conflict is preponderant” he stressed the importance of maintaining the best relations with the united states particularly in lebanon itself through the medium of us ambassador philip habib and the united states’ embassy in beirut no effort must be neglected to enlist the active political support of the greatest nation in the world for the lebanese cause bashir was confident that such good relations existed already “we entertain excellent relations with philip habib with the united states’ embassy in beirut and with the state department in washington through our offices abroad we enjoy close relations with all the centers of power and gravity throughout the world” with regard to ambassador philip habib’s mission in lebanon bashir expressed the wish to see these efforts continue  “i hope that ambassador habib’s mission here will be pursued until we clear up all our problems with his help in our present predicament we lebanese are in dire need of friendship from abroad to assist up in overcoming our difficulties and help us stand on our feet again” on relationship with european countriesedit relations between lebanon and the european states deteriorated because the latter also tried to solve the middleeast problem at the expense of lebanon in addition to this factor many european countries had adopted the obsequious policy of fawning on the arab states in order to secure their oil supplies this was done of course at the expense of the christians of their security their very existence bashir referred to both these factors in one of his speeches  “europe and many other states are not able to digest the christian presence in this corner of the world because it is a stumblingblock to most of their ambitions in this area the americans and the west have not yet assimilated the fact that we the christians of the orient represent their last line of defense against a return to the dark ages against terror and blind fundamentalism against those who seek to annihilate all the values of civilization and of their culture today they want to ‘sell us down the river’ for a barrel of oil” arab countriesedit gemayel firmly believed that lebanon has a great role to play in emancipation of the arab world but that lebanon must be respected and trusted as an equal and be free of foreign intervention including arab intervention and that arab governments must understand that lebanon is a sovereign state and has right to reject any policy contrary to its national interests he warned the arab world not to exploit the friendship and cooperation of the lebanese people by attempting to settle middle east conflicts at lebanons expense he acknowledged however that during his visit to taef he was advised by his saudi hosts that they understand lebanons problems and position on the plo and syria saudi leaders publicly lauded him for his leadership and vision gemayel insisted in his talks that the plo and syrian armed presence in lebanon is not negotiable or open for compromise since it undermines lebanons sovereignty which cannot be divided among nonlebanese armies he also praised the efforts deployed by saudi arabia and kuwait in helping lebanon and he called for stronger relations with these two countries the lebanese people he declared will reserve a special friendship for the saudis and their arab friends

achrafieh neighborhood of beirut on  november  the youngest of six children the gemayel family originated from bikfaya village in the matn district of lebanon and is one of the most influential christian families in the country his father was pierre gemayel who founded the phalange party in  as a youth movement bachir gemayel attended the jesuit collège notre dame de jamhour and the institution moderne du liban iml fanar he completed his university education at st joseph university université saintjoseph  usj in beirut after teaching for three years at the lebanese modern institute he graduated in  with a bachelors degree in law and another in political sciences in  in  gemayel studied at the center for american and international law near dallas texas in the united states qualifying in  he joined the bar association and opened an office in hamra street west beirut early activities in the kataeb partyedit bachir became a member of the kataeb party´s youth section when he was  years old bachir realized the dangers that surrounded lebanon in  so he spent a lot of time with the organized political wing of the kataeb party he attended the meetings organized by the kataeb student section and he was the president of the kataeb circle in st joseph university between  and  in the late 0s he underwent paramilitary training in bikfaya and he was appointed squad leader of a militia unit of the kataeb regulatory forces  krf the partys military wing formed in  then in the early 0s he formed the “bikfaya squad” within the rkf where he became acquainted with the basics of military combat in  he participated in a student colloquium organized by the newspaper orient following events which occurred across lebanese universities between the muslim and leftist panarabist students supporting the palestinians in lebanon on one side and lebanese christian nationalist phoenicist students whom bachir represented on the other after the  clashes between the lebanese army and the plo bachir gathered a group of christian students and started training them in the kataebrun tabrieh training camp located near bsharri in the keserwan district mountains this was the start of what would later become the lebanese forces at this stage he was a junior militia commander under the orders of william hawi the founder and head of the krf bachir with his father pierre bachir with kataeb regulatory forces militiamen in 0 bachir was briefly kidnapped by palestinian militants in lebanon and taken to the tel alzaatar refugee camp he was released  hours later bachir became a member of the “bg squad” formed by william hawi he was a revolutionary in the party he became close with jean nader the leader of achrafieh at that time and became the vice president of that lebanese capital district a position that he held from  till  bachir became the head of the “bg squad” after its members found him as a leader more close to their views this group was formed of  specially trained members such as fouad abou nader fadi frem elie hobeika and others they were fierce fighters and they were known for their violent performance in the field this group was out of the direct control of the party he had his own views and principles and he wanted to run for the vice presidency of the party but his men said to him that they want him as the leader of the “lebanese forces” and not the vp of a party in addition many members of the party did not want him as the vp because he was the son of pierre gemayel the founder and president of the party the elections were cancelled and did not take place until after his assassination he submitted his resignation from the party in  but it was rejected this was because the kataeb party had approved the entrance of the syrian army to lebanon to put an end to the war but bachir refused to accept this being strongly against the syrian intervention because he believed that syria wanted to annex lebanon he came to this conclusion because the syrian officials repeatedly stated that lebanon is part of syria and that the syrian army doesn’t need anyone’s permission to enter lebanon moreover at that time the syrian educational system used to teach that lebanon is a syrian district military commandedit conflict with the ploedit in  gemayel was accused by the lnm of being responsible for the black saturday massacre of palestinians and lebanese muslims according to phalange member karim pakradouni bachir admitted to him that while being in an emotional state for the killing of four phalangists earlier that day he ordered his militiamen into the streets bachir added that when the situation developed into something he did not agree with and civilians were being killed he tried to stop the killings but failed to however according to michel samaha another phalange member bachir was outside beirut arriving after the killing of civilians had started michel samaha added that bachir was one of the many senior members of the phalange party who tried to stop this massacre bachir in the street christian east beirut was ringed by heavily fortified palestinian camps from which kidnappings and sniping against lebanese civilians became a daily routine christian east beirut became besieged by the plo camps with severe shortages of food and fuel this unbearable situation led the kataeb forces and their allied christian militias to besiege the palestinian camps embedded in christian east beirut one at a time and bring them down on january   bachir led the invasion of the heavily fortified karantina camp that was located near the strategic beirut harbor about 0 plo fighters and civilians were killed the palestinian plo and assaiqa forces retaliated by attacking the isolated defenseless christian town of damour about  miles south of beirut on the coast during the damour massacre in which 0 christian civilians were killed and 0 were sent fleeing north by boat since all roads were blocked off the maronites retaliated with the invasion of the tel alzaatar camp that same year the camp was placed under siege for  days by the tigers militia led by dany chamoun bachir played an important role in the last stages of the battle he sent a group of his forces that moved through the sewers and they blew up the ammunition storage in the camp this incident was considered to be the lethal blow that led the fall of the camp the christian militias also fought against the plo and lnm militias at the battle of the hotels in central beirut bachir led the battle for the holiday inn that had an important strategic location the battle was a success for bachirs troops and they were able to move the plo out of the hotel after insuring the safety of the rear lines and their

lebanon at first to assist in defeating palestinian militants before turning into occupiers bachir giving a speech at don bosco training camp bachir led his troops in the infamous “hundred days war” in lebanon in  in which the lebanese forces successfully resisted the syrian shelling and attacking of eastern beirut for about three months before an arabbrokered agreement forced the syrians to end the siege syrians took high buildings such as burj rizk achrafieh and burj el murr using snipers and heavy weapons against civilians the soldiers stayed for  days another major clash took place near the sodeco area in achrafieh where the lebanese forces fought ferociously and led the syrian army out of the rizk building this war led to the withdrawal of the syrian troops from east beirut and the free christian areas at this time israel was the primary backer of the lebanese front’s militia in  at zahlé in the beqaa the largest christian town in the east confronted one of the biggest battles – both military and political – between the lebanese forces and the syrian occupying forces the lebanese forces were able to confront them and reverse the result of the battle of  with the help of  lebanese forces soldiers lf special forces the maghaweer sent from beirut as well as the towns inhabitants regardless of the very bad weather and heavy bombing convoys were sent in the snow to zahle

phalangists and it would be done on tuesday to be sure that tony frangieh would have finished his weekend vacation and left ehden on  june  bachir sent a squadron of his men led by samir geagea and elie hobeika to ehden but what bachir did not know is that tony frangieh never left ehden since his car did not work as soon as the squadron arrived bullets were flying all over their heads so they retaliated and this led to the killing of tony frangieh and his family in addition to tens of members of the marada militia the incident is known as the ehden massacre bachir was very angry about what happened but he stood by his men  in 0 in order to stop the clashes happening inside the christian areas between the kataeb militia and the tigers militia and in order to eliminate the possibility of an intrachristian war bachir sent his troops to the town of safra where dany chamoun and members of his tigers militia were vacationing the tigers under the control of elias el hannache were exterminated in what was later named safra massacre danys life was spared and he sought refuge in west beirut but camille chamouns support of the attack was interpreted as him believing that his son’s

him that the israeli defense force were planning an invasion to uproot the plo threat to israel and to move them out of lebanon while bachir did not control israel’s actions in lebanon the support

played an important role in bachirs election israel invaded and the plo were expelled from lebanon in august  during the invasion the israelis wanted the lebanese forces to assist the israeli army militarily by fighting the palestinians and muslims in west beirut however bachir refused that because he said that his forces would not assist an invading army by now bachir had announced his candidacy for president he was backed by the united states who sent peacekeeping troops to oversee the withdrawal of the plo from lebanon bachir had requested that they stay longer to keep lebanon stable until he could reunite it but his request was denied the mossad also contributed to his presidency on  august  being the only one to declare his bid bachir was elected president on  september

treaty with israel as soon as he took office in return of israels earlier support of lebanese forces and he also told bachir that the idf would stay in south lebanon if the peace treaty wasnt signed bachir was furious at begin and told him that the lebanese forces didnt fight for seven years and that they didnt sacrifice thousands of soldiers to free lebanon from the syrian army and the plo so that israel can take their place bachir also added that he will not sign the peace treaty without national consensus on the matter begin was reportedly angry at bachir for his public denial of israels support bachir refused signing a peace treaty arguing that time is needed to reach consensus with lebanese muslims and the arab nations this angered the israelis because they knew that it is almost impossible for the lebanese muslims to agree on a peace treaty they realized that bachir was starting to distance himself from them on  september  in an attempt to fix the relations between begin and bachir ariel sharon had a secret meeting with bachir in bikfaya during the meeting bachir told sharon that the lebanese army would soon enter into the palestinian camps to disarm any remaining fighters they also agreed that the lebanese army would attack the syrian armys positions in lebanon assisted by the israeli army in addition sharon tried to convince bachir about signing a peace

from a few miles away from the building when he came back to check on his sister he was immediately arrested he later confessed to it saying he had done this because “bachir had sold the country to israel” a reporter was heard telling him you didnt kill a man you killed a country he was imprisoned for  years until syrian troops took over lebanon at the end of the war and freed him on  october  amine gemayel did not condemn habib shartouni because of immense syrian pressure various theories exist as to other parties that had a hand in the assassination many point fingers at the syrian government and thensyrian president hafez alassad for having knowledge of the assassination attempt and for backing shartouni even after they kept pressuring him bachir refused to immediately give israel peace aftermathedit condemnations poured in from around the world including from the united nations security council in resolution  as well as from american president ronald reagan reagan had been one of bachirs most staunch supporters saying this promising young leader had brought the light of hope to lebanon bachir gemayels older brother amine gemayel was then elected as president serving from  to  rather different in temperament amine gemayel was widely regarded as more moderate than his brother many of bachirs followers were dissatisfied with amine eventually the lebanese forces became independent from the phalange and its own political party sabra and shatila massacreedit main article sabra and shatila massacre the sabra and shatila massacre was the killing of between  and  civilians mostly palestinians and lebanese shiites by a militia close to the kataeb party also called phalange a predominantly christian lebanese rightwing party in the sabra neighborhood and the adjacent shatila refugee camp in beirut lebanon the massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of newly elected lebanese president bachir gemayel the leader of the lebanese kataeb party legacyedit throughout the postwar period the cult of bashir gemayel was the most visible commemorative phenomenon in parts of beirut especially ashrafieh the leader of lf is revered with a wealth of different signs ranging from spraypainted profiles and posters in the public space of the entry hall of beiruts old jesuit university university saintjoseph personal lifeedit bachir gemayels widow solange gemayel works to keep his legacy alive through the bachir gemayel foundation a political and informational organization bachirs eldest daughter maya was murdered on  february 0 at  months of age by a car bomb intended for her father he had two surviving children his second daughter youmna was born later in the year and received her degree in political science in paris she is now working towards her masters in management at esa école supérieure des affaires in beirut gemayels son nadim who was born a few months before bachir was killed was a law student and political activist and was elected as a member of the lebanese parliament in  political viewsedit on relationship with the united statesedit the relations between lebanon and the united states had a high priority rating on gemayel’s agenda and occupied a sizeable portion of his time and efforts bachir gemayel believed that the us and lebanon are natural allies since they enjoy a common cultural affinity similar ideological beliefs free economic systems and strong commitment to human rights and dignity he believed in the us leadership of the free world and he was confident that washington would strengthen its ties to lebanon the lebanese people he declared do not wish that their american friends fight their battle and suffer casualties however they look to the us for economic and military aid so that they themselves may free their country when alexander haig us state secretary subsequently declared that the fact of restoring peace and security to lebanon would achieve the same result for all the countries of the region bashir wholeheartedly agreed with him and supported the new policy of the united states saying  “mr alexander haig is quite right in proclaiming this new attitude loud and clear in fact that its exactly what we have been saying for the past seven years” bashir did not minimize the role of the lebanese communities in the usa  he considered that his fellowlebanese living in the united states had an important role to play and distinguished two stages in this context  the first stage in which the lebanese overseas communities would not play any role at all ie the passive stage and a positive stage in which they would promote the cause of their father land and lobby for a modification in us foreign policy dealing with lebanon he said  “two years ago we were not present in the american forum the palestinians have their lobby so do the jews the kurds and the copts as for us whenever a representative of this country goes to the states it is usually to collect donations to fix the belfry of such or such a church or to obtain a grant for some school or other in a village but when our presence there became larger people began to sit up and take interest in the lebanese cause” bashir’s approach was not limited to this alone  he called for an efficient reorganiztion of the overseas lebanese collectivities in the united states because according to his views they represented a nonnegligible source of political and financial power he suggested  “there is a vital necessity to reorganize the groups of lebanese emigrants in a practical and modern manner in order to create our own lobby to promote the cause of our country in america we cannot ignore the fact that the united states constitute the world’s center of gravity and that their influence in the middleeast conflict is preponderant” he stressed the importance of maintaining the best relations with the united states particularly in lebanon itself through the medium of us ambassador philip habib and the united states’ embassy in beirut no effort must be neglected to enlist the active political support of the greatest nation in the world for the lebanese cause bashir was confident that such good relations existed already “we entertain excellent relations with philip habib with the united states’ embassy in beirut and with the state department in washington through our offices abroad we enjoy close relations with all the centers of power and gravity throughout the world” with regard to ambassador philip habib’s mission in lebanon bashir expressed the wish to see these efforts continue  “i hope that ambassador habib’s mission here will be pursued until we clear up all our problems with his help in our present predicament we lebanese are in dire need of friendship from abroad to assist up in overcoming our difficulties and help us stand on our feet again” on relationship with european countriesedit relations between lebanon and the european states deteriorated because the latter also tried to solve the middleeast problem at the expense of lebanon in addition to this factor many european countries had adopted the obsequious policy of fawning on the arab states in order to secure their oil supplies this was done of course at the expense of the christians of their security their very existence bashir referred to both these factors in one of his speeches  “europe and many other states are not able to digest the christian presence in this corner of the world because it is a stumblingblock to most of their ambitions in this area the americans and the west have not yet assimilated the fact that we the christians of the orient represent their last line of defense against a return to the dark ages against terror and blind fundamentalism against those who seek to annihilate all the values of civilization and of their culture today they want to ‘sell us down the river’ for a barrel of oil” arab countriesedit gemayel firmly believed that lebanon has a great role to play in emancipation of the arab world but that lebanon must be respected and trusted as an equal and be free of foreign intervention including arab intervention and that arab governments must understand that lebanon is a sovereign state and has right to reject any policy contrary to its national interests he warned the arab world not to exploit the friendship and cooperation of the lebanese people by attempting to settle middle east conflicts at lebanons expense he acknowledged however that during his visit to taef he was advised by his saudi hosts that they understand lebanons problems and position on the plo and syria saudi leaders publicly lauded him for his leadership and vision gemayel insisted in his talks that the plo and syrian armed presence in lebanon is not negotiable or open for compromise since it undermines lebanons sovereignty which cannot be divided among nonlebanese armies he also praised the efforts deployed by saudi arabia and kuwait in helping lebanon and he called for stronger relations with these two countries the lebanese people he declared will reserve a special friendship for the saudis and their arab friends

achrafieh neighborhood of beirut on  november  the youngest of six children the gemayel family originated from bikfaya village in the matn district of lebanon and is one of the most influential christian families in the country his father was pierre gemayel who founded the phalange party in  as a youth movement bachir gemayel attended the jesuit collège notre dame de jamhour and the institution moderne du liban iml fanar he completed his university education at st joseph university université saintjoseph  usj in beirut after teaching for three years at the lebanese modern institute he graduated in  with a bachelors degree in law and another in political sciences in  in  gemayel studied at the center for american and international law near dallas texas in the united states qualifying in  he joined the bar association and opened an office in hamra street west beirut early activities in the kataeb partyedit bachir became a member of the kataeb party´s youth section when he was  years old bachir realized the dangers that surrounded lebanon in  so he spent a lot of time with the organized political wing of the kataeb party he attended the meetings organized by the kataeb student section and he was the president of the kataeb circle in st joseph university between  and  in the late 0s he underwent paramilitary training in bikfaya and he was appointed squad leader of a militia unit of the kataeb regulatory forces  krf the partys military wing formed in  then in the early 0s he formed the “bikfaya squad” within the rkf where he became acquainted with the basics of military combat in  he participated in a student colloquium organized by the newspaper orient following events which occurred across lebanese universities between the muslim and leftist panarabist students supporting the palestinians in lebanon on one side and lebanese christian nationalist phoenicist students whom bachir represented on the other after the  clashes between the lebanese army and the plo bachir gathered a group of christian students and started training them in the kataebrun tabrieh training camp located near bsharri in the keserwan district mountains this was the start of what would later become the lebanese forces at this stage he was a junior militia commander under the orders of william hawi the founder and head of the krf bachir with his father pierre bachir with kataeb regulatory forces militiamen in 0 bachir was briefly kidnapped by palestinian militants in lebanon and taken to the tel alzaatar refugee camp he was released  hours later bachir became a member of the “bg squad” formed by william hawi he was a revolutionary in the party he became close with jean nader the leader of achrafieh at that time and became the vice president of that lebanese capital district a position that he held from  till  bachir became the head of the “bg squad” after its members found him as a leader more close to their views this group was formed of  specially trained members such as fouad abou nader fadi frem elie hobeika and others they were fierce fighters and they were known for their violent performance in the field this group was out of the direct control of the party he had his own views and principles and he wanted to run for the vice presidency of the party but his men said to him that they want him as the leader of the “lebanese forces” and not the vp of a party in addition many members of the party did not want him as the vp because he was the son of pierre gemayel the founder and president of the party the elections were cancelled and did not take place until after his assassination he submitted his resignation from the party in  but it was rejected this was because the kataeb party had approved the entrance of the syrian army to lebanon to put an end to the war but bachir refused to accept this being strongly against the syrian intervention because he believed that syria wanted to annex lebanon he came to this conclusion because the syrian officials repeatedly stated that lebanon is part of syria and that the syrian army doesn’t need anyone’s permission to enter lebanon moreover at that time the syrian educational system used to teach that lebanon is a syrian district military commandedit conflict with the ploedit in  gemayel was accused by the lnm of being responsible for the black saturday massacre of palestinians and lebanese muslims according to phalange member karim pakradouni bachir admitted to him that while being in an emotional state for the killing of four phalangists earlier that day he ordered his militiamen into the streets bachir added that when the situation developed into something he did not agree with and civilians were being killed he tried to stop the killings but failed to however according to michel samaha another phalange member bachir was outside beirut arriving after the killing of civilians had started michel samaha added that bachir was one of the many senior members of the phalange party who tried to stop this massacre bachir in the street christian east beirut was ringed by heavily fortified palestinian camps from which kidnappings and sniping against lebanese civilians became a daily routine christian east beirut became besieged by the plo camps with severe shortages of food and fuel this unbearable situation led the kataeb forces and their allied christian militias to besiege the palestinian camps embedded in christian east beirut one at a time and bring them down on january   bachir led the invasion of the heavily fortified karantina camp that was located near the strategic beirut harbor about 0 plo fighters and civilians were killed the palestinian plo and assaiqa forces retaliated by attacking the isolated defenseless christian town of damour about  miles south of beirut on the coast during the damour massacre in which 0 christian civilians were killed and 0 were sent fleeing north by boat since all roads were blocked off the maronites retaliated with the invasion of the tel alzaatar camp that same year the camp was placed under siege for  days by the tigers militia led by dany chamoun bachir played an important role in the last stages of the battle he sent a group of his forces that moved through the sewers and they blew up the ammunition storage in the camp this incident was considered to be the lethal blow that led the fall of the camp the christian militias also fought against the plo and lnm militias at the battle of the hotels in central beirut bachir led the battle for the holiday inn that had an important strategic location the battle was a success for bachirs troops and they were able to move the plo out of the hotel after insuring the safety of the rear lines and their effectiveness necessary for the safety of christian east beirut bachir and his troops decided to abandon the hotel bachir attending mass at a training camp in  with the death of william hawi killed by a sniper during the battle of tall alzaatar bachir became head of the kataeb regulatory forces militia later that year he became a leading member of the lebanese front a coalition of several christian parties and commander of their military wing the lebanese forces a military coalition of several christian militias which not only opposed the plo but also the syrian army presence who had entered lebanon at first to assist in defeating palestinian militants before turning into occupiers bachir giving a speech at don bosco training camp bachir led his troops in the infamous “hundred days war” in lebanon in  in which the lebanese forces successfully resisted the syrian shelling and attacking of eastern beirut for about three months before an arabbrokered agreement forced the syrians to end the siege syrians took high buildings such as burj rizk achrafieh and burj el murr using snipers and heavy weapons against civilians the soldiers stayed for  days another major clash took place near the sodeco area in achrafieh where the lebanese forces fought ferociously and led the syrian army out of the rizk building this war led to the withdrawal of the syrian troops from east beirut and the free christian areas at this time israel was the primary backer of the lebanese front’s militia in  at zahlé in the beqaa the largest christian town in the east confronted one of the biggest battles – both military and political – between the lebanese forces and the syrian occupying forces the lebanese forces were able to confront them and reverse the result of the battle of  with the help of  lebanese forces soldiers lf special forces the maghaweer sent from beirut as well as the towns inhabitants regardless of the very bad weather and heavy bombing convoys were sent in the snow to zahle the battle of zahle gave the lebanese cause a new perspective in the international communities and by some was regarded as military and diplomatic victory it strengthened bashir gemayels position because of his leadership and important role in this battle the battle started on  april  and finished with a cease fire and lebanese internal security forces gendarmes were sent to zahle the  lebanese forces commandos returned to beirut on  july  see battle of zahleh for more details tensions within the lebanese frontedit bachir with camille chamoun despite its increasing success in its battles against the plo and the syrian troops two factors led to the eventual demise of the lebanese front following the killing of many phalangist members in addition to a senior phalangist by members of the marada brigade militia which was led by a fellow member of the lebanese front tony frangieh bachir called for a meeting to decide on what to do about this situation at first the decision was to capture tony frangieh and force him to surrender the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists however there was concern about the consequences of this move so the decision was changed after many talks between the phalangists present at the meeting it was decided that the goal of the operation would be to capture the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists and it would be done on tuesday to be sure that tony frangieh would have finished his weekend vacation and left ehden on  june  bachir sent a squadron of his men led by samir geagea and elie hobeika to ehden but what bachir did not know is that tony frangieh never left ehden since his car did not work as soon as the squadron arrived bullets were flying all over their heads so they retaliated and this led to the killing of tony frangieh and his family in addition to tens of members of the marada militia the incident is known as the ehden massacre bachir was very angry about what happened but he stood by his men  in 0 in order to stop the clashes happening inside the christian areas between the kataeb militia and the tigers militia and in order to eliminate the possibility of an intrachristian war bachir sent his troops to the town of safra where dany chamoun and members of his tigers militia were vacationing the tigers under the control of elias el hannache were exterminated in what was later named safra massacre danys life was spared and he sought refuge in west beirut but camille chamouns support of the attack was interpreted as him believing that his son’s militia was getting too out of control israeli invasion of lebanon and bachirs electionedit israel invaded lebanon in  defense minister of israel ariel sharon met with bachir months earlier telling him that the israeli defense force were planning an invasion to uproot the plo threat to israel and to move them out of lebanon while bachir did not control israel’s actions in lebanon the support

from a few miles away from the building when he came back to check on his sister he was immediately arrested he later confessed to it saying he had done this because “bachir had sold the country to israel” a reporter was heard telling him you didnt kill a man you killed a country he was imprisoned for  years until syrian troops took over lebanon at the end of the war and freed him on  october  amine gemayel did not condemn habib shartouni because of immense syrian pressure various theories exist as to other parties that had a hand in the assassination many point fingers at the syrian government and thensyrian president hafez alassad for having knowledge of the assassination attempt and for backing shartouni even after they kept pressuring him bachir refused to immediately give israel peace aftermathedit condemnations poured in from around the world including from the united nations security council in resolution  as well as from american president ronald reagan reagan had been one of bachirs most staunch supporters saying this promising young leader had brought the light of hope to lebanon bachir gemayels older brother amine gemayel was then elected as president serving from  to  rather different in temperament amine gemayel was widely regarded as more moderate than his brother many of bachirs followers were dissatisfied with amine eventually the lebanese forces became independent from the phalange and its own political party sabra and shatila massacreedit main article sabra and shatila massacre the sabra and shatila massacre was the killing of between  and  civilians mostly palestinians and lebanese shiites by a militia close to the kataeb party also called phalange a predominantly christian lebanese rightwing party in the sabra neighborhood and the adjacent shatila refugee camp in beirut lebanon the massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of newly elected lebanese president bachir gemayel the leader of the lebanese kataeb party legacyedit throughout the postwar period the cult of bashir gemayel was the most visible commemorative phenomenon in parts of beirut especially ashrafieh the leader of lf is revered with a wealth of different signs ranging from spraypainted profiles and posters in the public space of the entry hall of beiruts old jesuit university university saintjoseph personal lifeedit bachir gemayels widow solange gemayel works to keep his legacy alive through the bachir gemayel foundation a political and informational organization bachirs eldest daughter maya was murdered on  february 0 at  months of age by a car bomb intended for her father he had two surviving children his second daughter youmna was born later in the year and received her degree in political science in paris she is now working towards her masters in management at esa école supérieure des affaires in beirut gemayels son nadim who was born a few months before bachir was killed was a law student and political activist and was elected as a member of the lebanese parliament in  political viewsedit on relationship with the united statesedit the relations between lebanon and the united states had a high priority rating on gemayel’s agenda and occupied a sizeable portion of his time and efforts bachir gemayel believed that the us and lebanon are natural allies since they enjoy a common cultural affinity similar ideological beliefs free economic systems and strong commitment to human rights and dignity he believed in the us leadership of the free world and he was confident that washington would strengthen its ties to lebanon the lebanese people he declared do not wish that their american friends fight their battle and suffer casualties however they look to the us for economic and military aid so that they themselves may free their country when alexander haig us state secretary subsequently declared that the fact of restoring peace and security to lebanon would achieve the same result for all the countries of the region bashir wholeheartedly agreed with him and supported the new policy of the united states saying  “mr alexander haig is quite right in proclaiming this new attitude loud and clear in fact that its exactly what we have been saying for the past seven years” bashir did not minimize the role of the lebanese communities in the usa  he considered that his fellowlebanese living in the united states had an important role to play and distinguished two stages in this context  the first stage in which the lebanese overseas communities would not play any role at all ie the passive stage and a positive stage in which they would promote the cause of their father land and lobby for a modification in us foreign policy dealing with lebanon he said  “two years ago we were not present in the american forum the palestinians have their lobby so do the jews the kurds and the copts as for us whenever a representative of this country goes to the states it is usually to collect donations to fix the belfry of such or such a church or to obtain a grant for some school or other in a village but when our presence there became larger people began to sit up and take interest in the lebanese cause” bashir’s approach was not limited to this alone  he called for an efficient reorganiztion of the overseas lebanese collectivities in the united states because according to his views they represented a nonnegligible source of political and financial power he suggested  “there is a vital necessity to reorganize the groups of lebanese emigrants in a practical and modern manner in order to create our own lobby to promote the cause of our country in america we cannot ignore the fact that the united states constitute the world’s center of gravity and that their influence in the middleeast conflict is preponderant” he stressed the importance of maintaining the best relations with the united states particularly in lebanon itself through the medium of us ambassador philip habib and the united states’ embassy in beirut no effort must be neglected to enlist the active political support of the greatest nation in the world for the lebanese cause bashir was confident that such good relations existed already “we entertain excellent relations with philip habib with the united states’ embassy in beirut and with the state department in washington through our offices abroad we enjoy close relations with all the centers of power and gravity throughout the world” with regard to ambassador philip habib’s mission in lebanon bashir expressed the wish to see these efforts continue  “i hope that ambassador habib’s mission here will be pursued until we clear up all our problems with his help in our present predicament we lebanese are in dire need of friendship from abroad to assist up in overcoming our difficulties and help us stand on our feet again” on relationship with european countriesedit relations between lebanon and the european states deteriorated because the latter also tried to solve the middleeast problem at the expense of lebanon in addition to this factor many european countries had adopted the obsequious policy of fawning on the arab states in order to secure their oil supplies this was done of course at the expense of the christians of their security their very existence bashir referred to both these factors in one of his speeches  “europe and many other states are not able to digest the christian presence in this corner of the world because it is a stumblingblock to most of their ambitions in this area the americans and the west have not yet assimilated the fact that we the christians of the orient represent their last line of defense against a return to the dark ages against terror and blind fundamentalism against those who seek to annihilate all the values of civilization and of their culture today they want to ‘sell us down the river’ for a barrel of oil” arab countriesedit gemayel firmly believed that lebanon has a great role to play in emancipation of the arab world but that lebanon must be respected and trusted as an equal and be free of foreign intervention including arab intervention and that arab governments must understand that lebanon is a sovereign state and has right to reject any policy contrary to its national interests he warned the arab world not to exploit the friendship and cooperation of the lebanese people by attempting to settle middle east conflicts at lebanons expense he acknowledged however that during his visit to taef he was advised by his saudi hosts that they understand lebanons problems and position on the plo and syria saudi leaders publicly lauded him for his leadership and vision gemayel insisted in his talks that the plo and syrian armed presence in lebanon is not negotiable or open for compromise since it undermines lebanons sovereignty which cannot be divided among nonlebanese armies he also praised the efforts deployed by saudi arabia and kuwait in helping lebanon and he called for stronger relations with these two countries the lebanese people he declared will reserve a special friendship for the saudis and their arab friends

achrafieh neighborhood of beirut on  november  the youngest of six children the gemayel family originated from bikfaya village in the matn district of lebanon and is one of the most influential christian families in the country his father was pierre gemayel who founded the phalange party in  as a youth movement bachir gemayel attended the jesuit collège notre dame de jamhour and the institution moderne du liban iml fanar he completed his university education at st joseph university université saintjoseph  usj in beirut after teaching for three years at the lebanese modern institute he graduated in  with a bachelors degree in law and another in political sciences in  in  gemayel studied at the center for american and international law near dallas texas in the united states qualifying in  he joined the bar association and opened an office in hamra street west beirut early activities in the kataeb partyedit bachir became a member of the kataeb party´s youth section when he was  years old bachir realized the dangers that surrounded lebanon in  so he spent a lot of time with the organized political wing of the kataeb party he attended the meetings organized by the kataeb student section and he was the president of the kataeb circle in st joseph university between  and  in the late 0s he underwent paramilitary training in bikfaya and he was appointed squad leader of a militia unit of the kataeb regulatory forces  krf the partys military wing formed in  then in the early 0s he formed the “bikfaya squad” within the rkf where he became acquainted with the basics of military combat in  he participated in a student colloquium organized by the newspaper orient following events which occurred across lebanese universities between the muslim and leftist panarabist students supporting the palestinians in lebanon on one side and lebanese christian nationalist phoenicist students whom bachir represented on the other after the  clashes between the lebanese army and the plo bachir gathered a group of christian students and started training them in the kataebrun tabrieh training camp located near bsharri in the keserwan district mountains this was the start of what would later become the lebanese forces at this stage he was a junior militia commander under the orders of william hawi the founder and head of the krf bachir with his father pierre bachir with kataeb regulatory forces militiamen in 0 bachir was briefly kidnapped by palestinian militants in lebanon and taken to the tel alzaatar refugee camp he was released  hours later bachir became a member of the “bg squad” formed by william hawi he was a revolutionary in the party he became close with jean nader the leader of achrafieh at that time and became the vice president of that lebanese capital district a position that he held from  till  bachir became the head of the “bg squad” after its members found him as a leader more close to their views this group was formed of  specially trained members such as fouad abou nader fadi frem elie hobeika and others they were fierce fighters and they were known for their violent performance in the field this group was out of the direct control of the party he had his own views and principles and he wanted to run for the vice presidency of the party but his men said to him that they want him as the leader of the “lebanese forces” and not the vp of a party in addition many members of the party did not want him as the vp because he was the son of pierre gemayel the founder and president of the party the elections were cancelled and did not take place until after his assassination he submitted his resignation from the party in  but it was rejected this was because the kataeb party had approved the entrance of the syrian army to lebanon to put an end to the war but bachir refused to accept this being strongly against the syrian intervention because he believed that syria wanted to annex lebanon he came to this conclusion because the syrian officials repeatedly stated that lebanon is part of syria and that the syrian army doesn’t need anyone’s permission to enter lebanon moreover at that time the syrian educational system used to teach that lebanon is a syrian district military commandedit conflict with the ploedit in  gemayel was accused by the lnm of being responsible for the black saturday massacre of palestinians and lebanese muslims according to phalange member karim pakradouni bachir admitted to him that while being in an emotional state for the killing of four phalangists earlier that day he ordered his militiamen into the streets bachir added that when the situation developed into something he did not agree with and civilians were being killed he tried to stop the killings but failed to however according to michel samaha another phalange member bachir was outside beirut arriving after the killing of civilians had started michel samaha added that bachir was one of the many senior members of the phalange party who tried to stop this massacre bachir in the street christian east beirut was ringed by heavily fortified palestinian camps from which kidnappings and sniping against lebanese civilians became a daily routine christian east beirut became besieged by the plo camps with severe shortages of food and fuel this unbearable situation led the kataeb forces and their allied christian militias to besiege the palestinian camps embedded in christian east beirut one at a time and bring them down on january   bachir led the invasion of the heavily fortified karantina camp that was located near the strategic beirut harbor about 0 plo fighters and civilians were killed the palestinian plo and assaiqa forces retaliated by attacking the isolated defenseless christian town of damour about  miles south of beirut on the coast during the damour massacre in which 0 christian civilians were killed and 0 were sent fleeing north by boat since all roads were blocked off the maronites retaliated with the invasion of the tel alzaatar camp that same year the camp was placed under siege for  days by the tigers militia led by dany chamoun bachir played an important role in the last stages of the battle he sent a group of his forces that moved through the sewers and they blew up the ammunition storage in the camp this incident was considered to be the lethal blow that led the fall of the camp the christian militias also fought against the plo and lnm militias at the battle of the hotels in central beirut bachir led the battle for the holiday inn that had an important strategic location the battle was a success for bachirs troops and they were able to move the plo out of the hotel after insuring the safety of the rear lines and their effectiveness necessary for the safety of christian east beirut bachir and his troops decided to abandon the hotel bachir attending mass at a training camp in  with the death of william hawi killed by a sniper during the battle of tall alzaatar bachir became head of the kataeb regulatory forces militia later that year he became a leading member of the lebanese front a coalition of several christian parties and commander of their military wing the lebanese forces a military coalition of several christian militias which not only opposed the plo but also the syrian army presence who had entered lebanon at first to assist in defeating palestinian militants before turning into occupiers bachir giving a speech at don bosco training camp bachir led his troops in the infamous “hundred days war” in lebanon in  in which the lebanese forces successfully resisted the syrian shelling and attacking of eastern beirut for about three months before an arabbrokered agreement forced the syrians to end the siege syrians took high buildings such as burj rizk achrafieh and burj el murr using snipers and heavy weapons against civilians the soldiers stayed for  days another major clash took place near the sodeco area in achrafieh where the lebanese forces fought ferociously and led the syrian army out of the rizk building this war led to the withdrawal of the syrian troops from east beirut and the free christian areas at this time israel was the primary backer of the lebanese front’s militia in  at zahlé in the beqaa the largest christian town in the east confronted one of the biggest battles – both military and political – between the lebanese forces and the syrian occupying forces the lebanese forces were able to confront them and reverse the result of the battle of  with the help of  lebanese forces soldiers lf special forces the maghaweer sent from beirut as well as the towns inhabitants regardless of the very bad weather and heavy bombing convoys were sent in the snow to zahle the battle of zahle gave the lebanese cause a new perspective in the international communities and by some was regarded as military and diplomatic victory it strengthened bashir gemayels position because of his leadership and important role in this battle the battle started on  april  and finished with a cease fire and lebanese internal security forces gendarmes were sent to zahle the  lebanese forces commandos returned to beirut on  july  see battle of zahleh for more details tensions within the lebanese frontedit bachir with camille chamoun despite its increasing success in its battles against the plo and the syrian troops two factors led to the eventual demise of the lebanese front following the killing of many phalangist members in addition to a senior phalangist by members of the marada brigade militia which was led by a fellow member of the lebanese front tony frangieh bachir called for a meeting to decide on what to do about this situation at first the decision was to capture tony frangieh and force him to surrender the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists however there was concern about the consequences of this move so the decision was changed after many talks between the phalangists present at the meeting it was decided that the goal of the operation would be to capture the members of the marada militia who killed the phalangists and it would be done on tuesday to be sure that tony frangieh would have finished his weekend vacation and left ehden on  june  bachir sent a squadron of his men led by samir geagea and elie hobeika to ehden but what bachir did not know is that tony frangieh never left ehden since his car did not work as soon as the squadron arrived bullets were flying all over their heads so they retaliated and this led to the killing of tony frangieh and his family in addition to tens of members of the marada militia the incident is known as the ehden massacre bachir was very angry about what happened but he stood by his men  in 0 in order to stop the clashes happening inside the christian areas between the kataeb militia and the tigers militia and in order to eliminate the possibility of an intrachristian war bachir sent his troops to the town of safra where dany chamoun and members of his tigers militia were vacationing the tigers under the control of elias el hannache were exterminated in what was later named safra massacre danys life was spared and he sought refuge in west beirut but camille chamouns support of the attack was interpreted as him believing that his son’s militia was getting too out of control israeli invasion of lebanon and bachirs electionedit israel invaded lebanon in  defense minister of israel ariel sharon met with bachir months earlier telling him that the israeli defense force were planning an invasion to uproot the plo threat to israel and to move them out of lebanon while bachir did not control israel’s actions in lebanon the support

played an important role in bachirs election israel invaded and the plo were expelled from lebanon in august  during the invasion the israelis wanted the lebanese forces to assist the israeli army militarily by fighting the palestinians and muslims in west beirut however bachir refused that because he said that his forces would not assist an invading army by now bachir had announced his candidacy for president he was backed by the united states who sent peacekeeping troops to oversee the withdrawal of the plo from lebanon bachir had requested that they stay longer to keep lebanon stable until he could reunite it but his request was denied the mossad also contributed to his presidency on  august  being the only one to declare his bid bachir was elected president on  september

impossible for the lebanese muslims to agree on a peace treaty they realized that bachir was starting to distance himself from them on  september  in an attempt to fix the relations between begin and bachir ariel sharon had a secret meeting with bachir in bikfaya during the meeting bachir told sharon that the lebanese army would soon enter into the palestinian camps to disarm any remaining fighters they also agreed that the lebanese army would attack the syrian armys positions in lebanon assisted by the israeli army in addition sharon tried to convince bachir about signing a peace

assassinated habib shartouni a member of the syrian social nationalist party and also a maronite christian was later arrested for the assassination his sister was living in the apartment above the room bachir was in he had visited her the previous day and planted the bomb in her apartment the next day he called her and told her to get out of the building once she was out he detonated the bomb from a few miles away from the building when he came back to check on his sister he was immediately arrested he later confessed to it saying he had done this because “bachir had sold the country to israel” a reporter was heard telling him you didnt kill a man you killed a country he was imprisoned for  years until syrian troops took over lebanon at the end of the war and freed him on  october  amine gemayel did not condemn habib shartouni because of immense syrian pressure various theories exist as to other parties that had a hand in the assassination many point fingers at the syrian government and thensyrian president hafez alassad for having knowledge of the assassination attempt and for backing shartouni even after they kept pressuring him bachir refused to immediately give israel peace aftermathedit condemnations poured in from around the world including from the united nations security council in resolution  as well as from american president ronald reagan reagan had been one of bachirs most staunch supporters saying this promising young leader had brought the light of hope to lebanon bachir gemayels older brother amine gemayel was then elected as president serving from  to  rather different in temperament amine gemayel was widely regarded as more moderate than his brother many of bachirs followers were dissatisfied with amine eventually the lebanese forces became independent from the phalange and its own political party sabra and shatila massacreedit main article sabra and shatila massacre the sabra and shatila massacre was the killing of between  and  civilians mostly palestinians and lebanese shiites by a militia close to the kataeb party also called phalange a predominantly christian lebanese rightwing party in the sabra neighborhood and the adjacent shatila refugee camp in beirut lebanon the massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of newly elected lebanese president bachir gemayel the leader of the lebanese kataeb party legacyedit throughout the postwar period the cult of bashir gemayel was the most visible commemorative phenomenon in parts of beirut especially ashrafieh the leader of lf is revered with a wealth of different signs ranging from spraypainted profiles and posters in the public space of the entry hall of beiruts old jesuit university university saintjoseph personal lifeedit bachir gemayels widow solange gemayel works to keep his legacy alive through the bachir gemayel foundation a political and informational organization bachirs eldest daughter maya was murdered on  february 0 at  months of age by a car bomb intended for her father he had two surviving children his second daughter youmna was born later in the year and received her degree in political science in paris she is now working towards her masters in management at esa école supérieure des affaires in beirut gemayels son nadim who was born a few months before bachir was killed was a law student and political activist and was elected as a member of the lebanese parliament in  political viewsedit on relationship with the united statesedit the relations between lebanon and the united states had a high priority rating on gemayel’s agenda and occupied a sizeable portion of his time and efforts bachir gemayel believed that the us and lebanon are natural allies since they enjoy a common cultural affinity similar ideological beliefs free economic systems and strong commitment to human rights and dignity he believed in the us leadership of the free world and he was confident that washington would strengthen its ties to lebanon the lebanese people he declared do not wish that their american friends fight their battle and suffer casualties however they look to the us for economic and military aid so that they themselves may free their country when alexander haig us state secretary subsequently declared that the fact of restoring peace and security to lebanon would achieve the same result for all the countries of the region bashir wholeheartedly agreed with him and supported the new policy of the united states saying  “mr alexander haig is quite right in proclaiming this new attitude loud and clear in fact that its exactly what we have been saying for the past seven years” bashir did not minimize the role of the lebanese communities in the usa  he considered that his fellowlebanese living in the united states had an important role to play and distinguished two stages in this context  the first stage in which the lebanese overseas communities would not play any role at all ie the passive stage and a positive stage in which they would promote the cause of their father land and lobby for a modification in us foreign policy dealing with lebanon he said  “two years ago we were not present in the american forum the palestinians have their lobby so do the jews the kurds and the copts as for us whenever a representative of this country goes to the states it is usually to collect donations to fix the belfry of such or such a church or to obtain a grant for some school or other in a village but when our presence there became larger people began to sit up and take interest in the lebanese cause” bashir’s approach was not limited to this alone  he called for an efficient reorganiztion of the overseas lebanese collectivities in the united states because according to his views they represented a nonnegligible source of political and financial power he suggested  “there is a vital necessity to reorganize the groups of lebanese emigrants in a practical and modern manner in order to create our own lobby to promote the cause of our country in america we cannot ignore the fact that the united states constitute the world’s center of gravity and that their influence in the middleeast conflict is preponderant” he stressed the importance of maintaining the best relations with the united states particularly in lebanon itself through the medium of us ambassador philip habib and the united states’ embassy in beirut no effort must be neglected to enlist the active political support of the greatest nation in the world for the lebanese cause bashir was confident that such good relations existed already “we entertain excellent relations with philip habib with the united states’ embassy in beirut and with the state department in washington through our offices abroad we enjoy close relations with all the centers of power and gravity throughout the world” with regard to ambassador philip habib’s mission in lebanon bashir expressed the wish to see these efforts continue  “i hope that ambassador habib’s mission here will be pursued until we clear up all our problems with his help in our present predicament we lebanese are in dire need of friendship from abroad to assist up in overcoming our difficulties and help us stand on our feet again” on relationship with european countriesedit relations between lebanon and the european states deteriorated because the latter also tried to solve the middleeast problem at the expense of lebanon in addition to this factor many european countries had adopted the obsequious policy of fawning on the arab states in order to secure their oil supplies this was done of course at the expense of the christians of their security their very existence bashir referred to both these factors in one of his speeches  “europe and many other states are not able to digest the christian presence in this corner of the world because it is a stumblingblock to most of their ambitions in this area the americans and the west have not yet assimilated the fact that we the christians of the orient represent their last line of defense against a return to the dark ages against terror and blind fundamentalism against those who seek to annihilate all the values of civilization and of their culture today they want to ‘sell us down the river’ for a barrel of oil” arab countriesedit gemayel firmly believed that lebanon has a great role to play in emancipation of the arab world but that lebanon must be respected and trusted as an equal and be free of foreign intervention including arab intervention and that arab governments must understand that lebanon is a sovereign state and has right to reject any policy contrary to its national interests he warned the arab world not to exploit the friendship and cooperation of the lebanese people by attempting to settle middle east conflicts at lebanons expense he acknowledged however that during his visit to taef he was advised by his saudi hosts that they understand lebanons problems and position on the plo and syria saudi leaders publicly lauded him for his leadership and vision gemayel insisted in his talks that the plo and syrian armed presence in lebanon is not negotiable or open for compromise since it undermines lebanons sovereignty which cannot be divided among nonlebanese armies he also praised the efforts deployed by saudi arabia and kuwait in helping lebanon and he called for stronger relations with these two countries the lebanese people he declared will reserve a special friendship for the saudis and their arab friends
