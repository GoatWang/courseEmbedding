this page continue reading the main story this interview with marcus ryu the ceo of guidewire software a maker of software for the insurance industry was conducted and condensed by adam bryant q tell me about the culture you’re trying to fostera a little background about our origins as a company will help guidewire was founded in  right after the tech crash and right after  it was a very contrarian time to start a company so one of our earliest principles was that we have to embrace adversity we have to embrace difficulty we won’t be rewarded just for being insightful we’re going to be rewarded for solving a difficult problem and if it’s not difficult it means that we’re not actually doing the right thingwe wanted to create an enduring business with a very strong set of values we chose integrity rationality and collegiality integrity is simply tell the truth there’s such a temptation to exaggerate because if you have enough time and wishful thinking you can build anything so we said first and foremost tell the simple truth there’s never any ambiguity we’re either going to win honestly or we’re going to not win at all and that’s the way it’s going to beno  is rationality which is to make decisions based on facts and logic that seems so simple and yet organizations really struggle to be rational so every decision to the maximum degree possible will be informed by objective criteria by facts and by logic and that means that titles don’t matter and gut instinct doesn’t matter even experience is of very limited value the facts have to speak that translates into one of our mantras which is “no wishful thinking” advertisement continue reading the main story the final one is collegiality which means minimum hierarchy we’re going to create a community of equal professionals there are some kinds of businesses where it’s hard to do that because you have to have people who do relatively lowlevel tasks and then people who just manage them the beauty of the kind of software we build is that you can actually build a very equal and collegial community of professionals continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q how did you come up with those valuesa there were six founders which is pretty large for a founding group we spent the first week just pondering these longerterm questions we said we have to consecrate our principles in a document that we will refer to over and over this will be our dna and every new person who joins the company will read the document we put a great deal of thought into this thinking of it almost like a constitution that will guide our future actionsq let’s talk about hiring a there’s nothing terribly radical about our hiring process we focus a lot on references and we hire a lot by internal referral but in the actual interview the main thing is that we ask people questions that are deeply relevant to the task at hand we don’t ask abstract brainteasers we examine their ability to do the kind of engineering they’re going to doq and beyond the discussion about engineering what questions would you aska i ask a lot of questions about motivation in reviewing a person’s background i care much more about what motivated the transitions in their career than the specific tasks they did why did you make the decision to go to this company at this point in time why did you leave after that what brings you at this moment to be interested in working for us if the answer is “guidewire seems like a great company and i’d like to be part of it” that’s not enough what specific attributes of guidewire interest you there has to be a substantiated thoughtthrough explanation of how that connects to the candidate’s own motivations there can be an economic component to that — that’s fine — but it has to be authentic the biggest red flag for us is when we see multiple career transitions in a short period there has to be an extraordinarily good explanation we’re looking for people who want to be with us for a long timeit’s also often a bad answer for me when people are trying to present every single career step as though it was this perfectly orchestrated narrative arc that’s not the way life usually worksq if you could ask somebody only a couple of questions in an interview what would they bea what is it that you most seek out of this current role how do you define professional fulfillment i like to hear an authentic answer to that i find that it’s very hard for people to lie about that question because stock answers sound so phony people who have reflected on that generally can speak from the heart photo marcus ryu is ceo of guidewire a maker of software for the insurance industry credit librado romerothe new york times q are there certain things you have particularly low tolerance for a the biggest red flag for me is when i hear people on a manager’s team especially their subordinates saying they sent the guy an email and they’ve been waiting a week for an answer that to me is intolerable there has to be prioritization but there’s no excuse for a manager to not be as responsive to people on their own team as they are to methe thing i most dislike in an employee is twofacedness where they manage up in a very diplomatic and collegial fashion but they’re a tyrant down that’s a very common duality that you see in the business world and it’s pernicious because you may not realize the problem for a long time one of the great dangers for people in my kind of role is that people are always so deferential to you they’re always so solicitous and careful about your needs that you may get the false impression that this is just the way they are when in fact they may be just doing that only in this very narrow context and they are indifferent

thought someone seemed very competent doing a great job really responsive and then found out that their team was in agony and ready to quit the company it was almost a jekyll and hyde kind of situation it was just shocking to me because i would never have detected it on my own it’s a great challenge in organizations to make sure you somehow provide a conduit for people to get that across advertisement continue reading the main story q anything unusual in how you run meetingsa we have people make a commitment to their colleagues by saying “in the next day i will achieve this” that is all the motivation you need you don’t actually need any other kind of managerial layer on top of that just the simple fact that i have spoken in front of my colleagues and said i was going to do something and then the next day i’m going to have to come back and say whether it was done or not is all the enforcement and motivation you needso our engineering teams get together every day and they stand up in a minute meeting and assert this is my plan for the day this is what i’ll get done tomorrow this is where i stand with respect to the stuff i said i would do we’re not the ones to invent this approach we’ve just really taken it to heartq it’s like a football huddlea it’s actually called a scrum meeting we’re trying to replicate that in other places in the company including in the management team so at the end of every quarterly management team meeting one of the little rituals i have is that i say i’d like every person just to speak of the one thing just one that you will have achieved by the next time we get together there’s just an implicit pressure that you have to say something reasonably ambitious and substantial and i write it down but it doesn’t matter because the next time we get together everyone has remembered what it is of course everyone has more than one thing to do but there’s something very focusing about itit’s just another example of trying to maximize the transparency and use this incredible power of a combination of selfimposed and peer pressure if you have the right people it’s actually infinitely more powerful than a command or a dictateq do you have certain expressions you repeat oftena i say “no wishful thinking” all the time another is this idea of embracing adversity it’s been very hard to get here and we should take pleasure in how hard it has been it’s hard to build our products everything is hard so my expression for it is “tunneling through granite” i say that we have tunneled through granite to get to this point and there’s an infinite amount of granite left we’ll never get through it all so you have to decide do you actually enjoy tunneling and want to be part of this because i’ve got nothing to promise you besides an infinite amount more of granite people have said it’s a little gloomy it’s like you’re just saying it’s nothing but blood sweat and tears forever for all of eternity and so i’ve tried to lighten up about thatq what are some lessons you’ve learned during your time as a ceoa i came from a very academic background so i had a lot of faith in the power of words and the power of ideas in philosophy especially analytic philosophy there’s this idea that if you have a powerfulenough argument you can just compel the other person to agree that’s what philosophers actually believe that’s how they interact with each other of course the real world isn’t like that — people have another option which is just to ignore you and that happens all the time even though we talked about how important rationality is in the company i’ve come to accept that rationality plays a very limited role in persuasion and that it’s mostly about emotion it’s mostly about empathy authenticity and commitment these kinds of things are what persuade and it’s the reason that people make big decisions like whether to bet their career on joining and staying with a companyno  which is sort of a corollary to that is about communicating with large groups of people i’ve come to realize that no matter how smart the people are you’re communicating to the more of them there are the dumber the collective gets and so you could have a room full of einsteins but if there are  or  of them then you still have to talk to them like they’re just average people as the audience gets bigger and bigger your message has to get simpler and simpler and the bulletpoint list has to be shorter and shorterone of the main things people want to hear from their leaders is optimism about the future they want to hear truth but when you’re talking about the future they want to hear optimism like “i stand before you i’m here for the duration we’ve got some challenges we’re equal to them nothing we have to do is harder than what we’ve had to do to get here and we’re going to join arms and be shouldertoshoulder and we’re going to succeed as we never have before” and that in some form is the message that you have to give every time continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think corner office conversations with adam bryant about leadership and

call we may offer incremental metrics to provide greater insight into the dynamics of our business these details maybe onetime in nature and we may or may not provide updates in the future with that let me turn the call over to marcus for his prepared remarks and then i will provide details on our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and the rest of the fiscal year marcus ryu thanks richard revenue and profitability exceeded our guidance ranges in the third quarter with license revenue of  million total revenue of  million and nongaap operating income of  million trailing  months recurring license and maintenance revenue totaled  million an increase of  from a year ago a diverse mix of deals in the quarter drove our performance including a large followon deal with a tier  customer that closed earlier than expected  new insurancesuite customers several new digital and data licenses and our first insurancenow customer since our acquisition and rebranding of iscs in north america attune insurance selected insurancesuite and data for lines of business serving the small and mediumsized commercial market electric insurance originally founded in  to serve employees of general electric selected insurancesuite digital and data for their personal lines the workers’ compensation board of nova scotia also selected insurancesuite digital and data these transactions illustrate the high attach rates we continue to see in digital and data and continue to validate our investments in these new products in addition to these customer wins bpce assurances part of the second largest banking group in france selected claimcenter and rockingham group licensed insurancenow for its home auto farm and small business lines becoming the first new customer for this cloudbased core system offering since our acquisition of iscs the crossselling of our digital and data products into existing customers continued as a theme in the quarter in addition to the new customers i just mentioned amica hartford fire insurance seibels technology solutions and pv assurances in belgium all licensed one or more of our digital products while a new customer we announced earlier in the year saga services in the uk added on our digital products to their implementation of insurancesuite we have begun adapting our digital and data products for cloudbased delivery to work equally well with either of our core system platforms insurancesuite and insurancenow as the themes of digital customer engagement and sophisticated data analytics continue to grow in urgency we believe that we have the opportunity to deepen and expand our products in these domains and a tight integration with the core operating platform will continue to be a key source of differentiation our largest deal in the quarter and indeed the year was with an existing tier  customer who expanded their license of policycenter beyond their current use for commercial lines to all of their personal lines as well as adding several digital products as we have discussed before the timing and structure of large transactions can be challenging for us to predict precisely this transaction is an example of that variability having come in a quarter earlier than anticipated thereby shifting some of the endofyear seasonality to the third quarter while earning new and expanding existing customer relationship is important it is equally vital that we follow through on our delivery commitments guidewire’s services team continues to distinguish itself by helping our many diverse customers achieve implementation success in this quarter we celebrated multiple golives and upgrades of our core data and digital products including at alberta motor association axa asia mountain west farm bureau and safety national we also had the initial golive of policycenter and billingcenter at icare one of the largest workers’ compensation programs in the world insuring over  million workers in new south wales australia and nationwide insurance became our first tier  consumer to go live with our digital products and especially noteworthy in the quarter was the initial golive of a customer project we had described on previous calls as the digital greenfield initiative this cloudbased implementation of insurancesuite with metlife was notable in several respects namely for supporting a major insurer’s launch of a new digitalonly gotomarket approach and for being the first time that guidewire is taking full responsibility for ongoing delivery of our software postproduction so this project and other internal efforts we – through this project and other internal efforts we are significantly increasing our competency to deliver and support largescale transformation programs in the cloud we expect to leverage this capability in fy ‘ as larger insurers begin to evaluate cloudbased implementations for their corebased business lines in summary our third quarter advanced our market adoption and capability and enhances our confidence in achieving our financial goal through the year this is a highly dynamic time for the enormous global industry we serve we see insurers around the world grappling with new entrants and structural changes and endmarket behavior driving to leverage new technology for customer engagement and investing in new gotomarket and analytic approaches we believe excellence in industryspecific software development and delivery has never been as relevant or as well rewarded as it is today and we are determined to continue to have leadership position as a trusted partner to the industry i’ll now turn the call over to richard to review our third quarter results in more detail and to provide our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and the rest of the year as well as offering a preliminary highlevel view to fiscal  richard hart thank you marcus we delivered a strong financial performance in the third quarter which benefited as marcus mentioned from a very large followon transaction at an existing tier  customer that was completed one quarter earlier than we had projected the shift helped produce revenue and profitability that was well above our guidance ranges for the quarter total revenue in the quarter was  million up  from a year ago within revenue license and other revenue of  million represented an increase of  from the third quarter of last year license and other revenue was  million above the high end of our guidance range as noted because of the earlierthanexpected completion of that tier  transaction i mentioned maintenance revenue of  million was at the upper end of our guidance range and increased  from a year ago services revenue was  million an increase of  from a year ago and was above our guidance range approximately  million of that figure represents insurancenowrelated revenues which we continue to believe will contribute approximately  million to  million for the year as we mentioned previously hosting and services revenue for iscs customers that contracted prior to our acquisition appear in our services revenue line services revenue associated with all other guidewire products drove the outperformance as utilization rates trended higher in the quarter than we anticipated turning to profitability we will discuss these metrics on a nongaap basis and we have provided the comparable gaap metrics and the reconciliation of gaap to nongaap measures in our earnings press release issued today with the primary difference being stockbased compensation expense and costs related to the amortization of intangible assets nongaap gross profit in the third quarter was  million an increase of  from a year ago this represents a nongaap gross margin of  a  basis point decline from a year ago primarily due to a decline in services margins resulting from the deferral of services revenues associated with our metlife project nevertheless we are now estimating that services margins for the year will decline by approximately  from last year as opposed to the  percentage point decline we had previously anticipated for the following reasons higher than anticipated services revenues and margins as utilization rates improved in all geographies and the time we go live of our metlife project allowing us to begin recognizing deferred services revenues in the fourth quarter and ongoing services revenues on a timeandmaterials basis our annual guidance at the beginning of the year incorporated a slightly more conservative view on the timing of project completion total nongaap operating expenses were  million in the third quarter an increase of  compared to a year ago including expenses associated with approximately  employees gained through the acquisition of iscs as well as higher than anticipated sales commissions nongaap operating income was  million or over  million above the high end of our guidance range due primarily to revenue outperformance in the quarter and to a lesser extent higher than anticipated services margins i would also like to point out that in the quarter we capitalized approximately  of software development costs as we shift our development work to new cloud applications that will only be offered as a service we will be required to capitalize certain rd costs but we believe capitalized software development costs will continue to be modest in fiscal  with nongaap operating income well above expectations nongaap net income of  million or  per diluted share also exceeded the top end of our guidance range turning to our balance sheet we ended the third quarter with  million in cash cash equivalents and investments down from  million at the end of the second quarter primarily due to disbursements associated with the acquisition of iscs early in the quarter yeartodate operating cash flow was  million total deferred revenue was  million at the end of the third quarter this represents a sizable increase from the prior quarter deferred revenue increased for each of license due to third quarter invoices to amounts owed in q maintenance due primarily to the contribution of the large tier  deal i mentioned and services which were attributable primarily to the metlife project as a reminder our deferred revenue balance can vary significantly from quartertoquarter and should not be relied upon as a meaningful indicator of business activity since we typically bill from license contracts annually and recognize the full annual payment upon the due date however in the future deferred revenue may increase incrementally as a result of sales of software for which revenues will be recognized ratably including licenses of underwriting management insurancenow and cloud delivered insurancesuite as an aside when we first acquired iscs we expected to begin recognizing revenues associated with new sales of insurancenow at the time of project completion our new saas based licensing model will allow us to begin recognizing revenue upon the successful provisioning of a production environment for the customer which can occur shortly after contract signing turning to guidance our full year expectations for revenue are modestly improved from our prior guidance in addition higher services margins and modest cost management efforts allow us to increase our full year profitability expectations more significantly for fiscal year  we offer the following updated guidance we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of  million to  million representing an increase of  to  over fiscal  within revenue we anticipate that license revenue would be in the range of  million to  million an increase of  to  from fiscal  we expect maintenance revenue to be in the range of  million to  million representing an increase of  to  and we expect services revenue to be in the range of  million to  million an increase of  to  from fiscal  we expect nongaap operating income to be in the range of  million to  million resulting in full year nongaap operating margin of approximately  at the midpoint we anticipate that nongaap net income in the range of  million to  million or  to  per diluted share based on approximately  million diluted shares we anticipate a gaap – a nongaap tax rate of approximately  and an effective gaap tax rate of  for the full year we now expect free cash flow of between  million to  million and operating cash flow of  million to  million with anticipated capital expenditures of approximately  million therefore for the fourth quarter we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of  million to  million representing growth of  to  within revenue we expect license revenue of  million to  million maintenance revenue of  million to  million and services revenue of  million to  million for the fourth quarter we anticipate a nongaap operating income of between  million and  million and nongaap net income of between  million and  million or  to – i am sorry  to  per diluted share based on approximately  million diluted shares we anticipate a nongaap tax rate for the year of approximately  and an effective gaap tax rate of  for the fourth quarter looking beyond fiscal  we expect new products and delivery models to combine with ongoing demand for technology to produce continued revenue growth while our goal remains to grow recurring revenue by  we also expect to increasingly deliver products with ratable licensing models complementing our traditional term licenses the mix of term and ratable licensing models is difficult for us to predict the amount and timing of transactions that would be accounted for on a ratable basis each have an impact on the amount of the license revenue we can recognize in the fiscal year we will be working to assess that mix as we complete our budgeting work for fiscal year ‘ and hope to be able to provide better direction in our fourth quarter earnings call but it must be emphasized that these transitions reduce the visibility on how much new orders can be recognized as revenue within any given fiscal year with regard to services revenues we anticipate a significant increase in fiscal year  we are currently estimating that services revenue will grow by  to  next year such increase is being driven by the recognition of deferred and services revenue from our metlife project services related to iscs implementations and organic services growth while this will increase services as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year ‘ we continue to focus on the implementation of programs designed to maintain a longterm model wherein services represent approximately  of total revenue our margins and profitability in fiscal ‘ will be substantially ahead of our initial guidance this improvement can be attributed to several factors including more modest dilution from our recent acquisitions higher than anticipated services margins and more modest headcount increases we believe our operating margins in fiscal ‘ will improve incrementally even as we anticipate a greater mix of lower margin services revenue and utilization rates which will decline to more sustainable levels furthermore in addition to standard investments in rd and sales next year we anticipate increased levels of ga spend as we fund investments and information security requirements for future cloud deployments and implement new systems including indiscernible revenue system in summary our third quarter performance exceeded our expectation and reflects continued demand for transformational technology in the pc insurance industry we look forward to continued growth this year and beyond as we focus on providing advanced solutions and flexible delivery options to meet the evolving needs of the industry we serve operator you can now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from tom roderick with stifel please go ahead matt vanvliet yes hi thanks for taking my questions it’s matt vanvliet on for tom this afternoon i guess i wanted to focus first on the large tier  deal that you were able to pull forward could you – can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of how that sales cycle sort of progressed maybe a little bit more on the customer in terms of what they have been using and how successfully they are there on the go live or the middle of the implementation marcus ryu yes so out of respect for the customer wishes we are not discussing their names they are a large us tier  insurer with whom we have started a relationship on their business line the commercial lines of business and which is – which are significantly smaller than their personal lines of business it was always their intention i believe to expand the relationship once we had demonstrated our capability of delivery and it was on the strength of the success of the initial phases of the program that this customer developed the confidence to move forward with an expansion of the relationship this is pretty much how all of our tier  relationships evolve over time but they do it at different paces as we have discussed in the past this was approximately on schedule we are approximately on average for the next material expansion of the relationship it just happened to be particularly large in size matt vanvliet and then also on some of the sales activity around the insurancenow platform can you talk about what the response has been from potential customers and maybe even existing customers that might have smaller either subsidiaries or other businesses that that might be more appropriate for marcus ryu sure i think overall the acquisition has been very well received by our end customers on the part of existing iscs customers i think they were comforted to know that we were very committed to the product line and continuing to invest in the health of that and the evolution of that product over time and in the case of guidewire’s prior customers and prospective customers i think having this additional option which applies to quite a different segment than our traditional focus was also wellreceived as an interesting strategic choice that they would be allowed to make now while continuing to work with guidewire naturally since the acquisition closed we have always been focused on integration and in bringing our – getting our gotomarket strategy together and communicating a clear product strategy to the market and i think that has led to a development of the pipeline that we need to execute on for this coming year matt vanvliet alright great thank you operator and we will take our next question from nandan amladi please go ahead nandan amladi good afternoon thanks for taking my question so marcus in your script you’ve increasingly made mention of digital products becoming a bigger part of the new bookings can you characterize that perhaps quantify it relative to the last couple of quarters versus maybe the same period a year ago or  years ago and what impact that’s had on your overall win rates marcus ryu yes i don’t have a specific calculation though as we did last year we will be forthcoming with a specific number in our analyst day or actually in our q earnings call i can tell you qualitatively that it has been roughly continuing constant from the last number of quarters i think in the past we characterized new product sales as contributing about a quarter of our bookings and that would be my guess for approximately where we are today they are very important to – they are the motivators for customers to move forward with major transformation programs the themes of digital engagements of data sophistication and predictive analytics all of these are very very topical themes and even if the early stages of the project are the same in that we are talking about replacing an existing legacy system and those steps are not that different today than they were   years ago the ultimate business objective is now more often than not framed in terms of changing the engagement model with the insurance and customer and so the theme of digital is very very important and is a major part of the evaluation cycle nandan amladi thank you and a followup for richard – as we look into next fiscal year how much – how many moving parts i guess are still left in the deferred revenue you made mention of this in your script a little while ago about an early view into next year first of all might the deployment choices that you are giving customers now sort of in a sense reduce your visibility and then more nearterm deferred revenue from metlife and other projects that are imminently going live over the next quarter or two so maybe could you characterize how you see this playing out over the next five quarters say richard hart so on the deferred revenue side and metlife specifically we have accrued approximately  million of deferred revenue over the life of the project and we will be taking that through the revenue line over the next eight quarters kind of in a linear fashion so you will see at least the effective metlife will be to reduce our deferred revenue balance over the next little bit of time there are moving pieces and we will talk more about the moving pieces on our fourth quarter call we still don’t have sufficient visibility to be very specific about where we think the mix of transactions will come in next year and i think even at the beginning of the year we’ll still have some uncertainty around that so this is kind of a new market for us but those projects should not necessarily significantly increase deferred revenue since we should start taking revenue on those projects as soon as the product is provisioned and therefore the deferred revenue balances should be muted the additional deferred revenue increase that you saw this year was really the artifact of a significant maintenance boost because of the size of the one large transaction in the maintenance line and for the license we simply tend to have some variability on license deferred simply because of the timing of our billing and invoices of last collection from our customers nandan amladi thank you operator and we will take our next question from ken wong with citi ken wong hey guys so this is a question for richard first you mentioned that profitability in ‘ will be higher than what you guys had previously discussed and if i recall from analyst day you guys are thinking kind of  to  points above the  in ‘ i guess any rough sense for how much above it might be and is that really just from the impact of the deferred revenue coming off a little quicker or is there some other elements there that’s driving that higher richard hart no i think there are lot of moving pieces that will affect margins next year one of the things that i think is important to note is that we came into this year looking at significant dilution from three acquisitions and the accounting effects of the metlife deferral you are going to see those kind of come out of the pl next year and we have already been able to reduce the dilutive effects of our acquisitions not insignificantly and expect to be able to do so by the end of the year if you look at our new guidance margin in the middle of our range is about  which is significantly higher than the  that we started out the year at and so i think by the end of the year hopefully we can do that maybe even a little bit better and then on top of that you will see some incremental improvement in  at least that’s what we can speak to right now ken wong got it and then marcus in terms of the – just kind of what you guys might do going forward with the cloud product i guess are you guys engaging with customers now any rough sense for kind of are those large customers small mediumsized customers just any color on what that pipeline might look like will be great marcus ryu sure and thanks for the question ken to be clear we have two offerings for a clouddeployed solution insurancenow which is clearly sold and delivered only in that form and then insurancesuite which is from its traditional onpremise mode and now going into the future there is an option of it being clouddeployed as well we would not have embarked on the project with metlife as a oneoff always the intention in undertaking that was to develop the competency that we believe would be increasingly relevant to the market and we are definitely seeing that today in general it would be larger and more complex operations business units or entire companies that would find the clouddeployed insurancesuite model to be the most appropriate for them we are guessing right now or estimating what portion of the future demand for insurancesuite will come in that form we think it’s increasing over time but we are not in a position yet to guess exactly how much of it will come over time we are going to – and we are going to put forward a view and that will be incorporated into our guidance that we will give after the next earnings call ken wong got it i guess maybe just a quick followup in terms of the insurancesuite cloud portion i mean have you already had some of your larger customers reach out to at least inquire about it or is that still a little early marcus ryu no we are engaged in multiple conversations with customers in fact not just in the us but internationally as well i think the appeal is definitely there and there is – and the underlying drive to simplify it environments and transfer more of the postproduction responsibility to us as the technology provider is i think a trend that we are going to continue to see now we are not going to market universally in that form and we still think that the large majority of significant niche of tier  and tier  insurers are going to prefer the traditional mode of delivery but there is no question that there will be increasing demand for a cloud delivered form of insurancesuite over time and we are mobilizing accordingly ken wong got it great thanks a lot guys operator and we will take our next question from monika garg with pacific crest securities monika garg hi thanks for taking my question first richard if i look at like  to  so – with revenue increase you guide for fiscal ‘ it amounts to about  million higher service revenue so maybe can you split the three buckets it looks like it will be around  millionish higher from insurance iscs insurancenow and then about  millionish i guess for this greenfield project metlife project is that the right way to think about it richard hart i think there are three things that will drive services higher right one is metlife will provide i say approximately  million of additional revenue on top of an organic growth rate and services or anywhere between – let me not guess because i am not prepared to talk about that yet the other thing that will happen is that the iscs services revenues they only had a portion of this year will come in full next year and that will drive a significant amount of that growth as well and so it’s the operation of the organic growth in services the insurancenow revenue stream that comes fully online in fiscal year ‘ and the metlife deferred revenue recognition that will drive that  to  growth monika garg and then how much is the organic you are expecting and what is the gross margins you were expecting for this one for the services richard hart so we will provide more definitive guidance in our q call monika we try to provide some sense on the q call to make sure that people understand what the big moving pieces are in our model but we will be much better prepared to give you that kind of detail in q monika garg got it then just moving to the metlife project maybe if you can provide more details are you managing all the – now the data would – have been moved to the cloud and has metlife moved everything on the cloud or just some part of the data or just some part of your solution marcus ryu right to be clear we have a twofold relationship with metlife they have an existing book of business several billion dollars in size in total premiums that is implementing insurancesuite in the conventional mode and then we will be into calling up to this point the digital greenfield project as a separate effort with a different gotomarket approach sort of digital only product rebranded remarketed a distinct strategy and separate from that – their traditional book of business and that is what we have this cloud delivered form intrinsically operating in today in that latter category for that digital greenfield project we have full postproduction responsibility for the delivery of the solution and while it runs on aws it’s our responsibility to ensure service levels and customer experience and all the like monika garg got it marcus could you share kind of the margins on this responsibility what you have marcus ryu it will be premature to do that monika i think one of the topics that we want to be forthcoming about at the analyst day is to do a kind of sidebyside comparison of what the economics look like for our traditional model and projects of this type in general they represent a higher revenue level to guidewire a higher subscription fee that’s how we will be characterizing it but of course their heavier responsibility is on us well and kind of cashing all that out and mapping it out clearly will be one of our tasks at analyst day monika garg okay thank you so much operator and we will take our next question from jesse hulsing with goldman sachs please go ahead jesse hulsing yes thank you marcus can you give us an update on europe and i think last quarter you had started to talk about seeing a turn there and i am wondering if that started to follow through into bookings in the third quarter and what are your expectations for that geography as we go into the fiscal ‘ marcus ryu yes thanks jesse europe is an extremely important geography to us they are – by total premium volume it’s larger than north america and any of the most significant enterprises that we want to sell to the huge multinationals tend to be european so it’s very very important to us all the major continental countries in europe are very underpenetrated for us todate and we have significant longterm growth plans in all of them this is – this has been a good year for us in europe i think we made a lot of progress and we still have more to achieve before the year is up in this quarter i mentioned a couple of new transactions and expansions of relationships in the uk a new customer in france which is the first one for quite a while an expansion of a key customer relationship in belgium and we have had – we have seen a lot more activity in the dark region than we had in previous years and we are expecting to closing on some of that in the coming period jesse hulsing great and when you look at the greenfield i guess cloud based version of insurancesuite what are the i guess deployment scenarios that you are looking at i would assume that there is less of a core line type of deployment initially maybe going after more ancillary alliance or small alliance or new geographies or something like that but i am curious in the conversations that you are having with potential new cloud customers what do those look like as far as use cases and then i know it’s very early but how do you think that translates into relative deal sizes versus what they might have been onpremise marcus ryu that’s a very helpful question we are seeing the demand come in all different flavors for that deployment choice there are cases where it is entirely new business line the greenfield initiative where there is a desire to very rapidly keep it distinct from the business as usual core book of business but we are also seeing situations where even for that core book of business it might be an appealing choice and we don’t know yet the dynamics of that demand whether we – it can be and will be motivated by just in a steady state situation or it will be a catalyst like an upgrade kind of upgrade where that discussion will become more natural or it will always be accompanied with an expansion of business or not these are still questions that we will have to see as the demand evolves but it’s definitely coming to us in diverse form it’s not just in the us it’s actually in all of our territories europe asia pacific north america and across different sizes of insurers as well so i think over time the customers that we support in that mode versus in the conventional mode of – that we deliver insurancesuite they – those two except the customers may look very similar over time jesse hulsing got it thank you operator and we will take our next question from rishi jaluria with jmp securities rishi jaluria hi guys thank you for taking my questions with the iscs acquisition closed are there any additional steps that you need to take in terms of integration with some of the digital and data products or internationalizing it marcus ryu yes there is definitely product work still to come rishi our vision here is that we will have a choice of core our traditional insurancesuite core which is policy claims and billing as distinct applications that can be implemented and upgraded separately versus the insurancenow core which is allinone and it runs on a single database single application server etcetera and they are both relevant to different segments of the market in some cases both relevant to the same enterprise but they are different cores but we want to have all of our data and digital products and indeed any other ancillary products that we would build or acquire in the future to work equally well with both and there is work to be done to make that so but as all of our products become more and more cloud based we think that that becomes easier to do and that’s – it’s all very much embedded in our product roadmap from here for all of our products rishi jaluria okay and then how about on the side of – i guess iscs was almost entirely us customers are there any steps you have to make in terms of that to make it more applicable for the european market you thought – that you talked about earlier or any other international markets marcus ryu absolutely another key goal for insurancenow is that we internationalize it there are – we have been through the international position journey before with insurancesuite and there is a lot of work to do it’s not merely a matter of localizing the products so that it can support different currencies and languages but actually the larger corpus of work is adapting it to the regulatory requirements the reporting requirements in different geographies and kind of prebuilding the integrations that are required we think we can do this significantly faster than we have – than we did with insurancesuite over the years because of that experience and the competencies we have now but that work is ahead of us over time we really just expect to have these two core choices that should apply to the entirety of the global pc market and then we want our data and digital products a single version of each to work equally well with both of those cores rishi jaluria got it and now going back to the metlife project marcus what – i guess what sort of milestones or benchmarks are you looking at with that project to gaze a level of success with it and what needs to happen with that project until you are ready to take on other digital greenfield projects like that and you have the capacity and bandwidth to do so marcus ryu yes i would say that we are ready right now and we are actively engaged in those discussions and that was part of the goal of this program was it’s one thing to plan to be ready it’s another thing to actually do it for a significant customer as you are scaling up that capability and they have – our relationship with metlife has been invaluable in really capability testing what we are doing with the team and our readiness to serve other customers as well but it was always with a mind towards pursuing other relationships at the same time and we intend to go to market with that we are actually impacted in the market with that right now rishi jaluria okay got it and then yes just in terms of any specific milestones on that project with the metlife project marcus ryu right so one difference with this project in addition to the fact that we have postproduction responsibility for delivering the software really as a service to that customer is that we are sharing in the risk of their business success right they are going to market with a new approach essentially a new business unit and however well the software works – that business unit actually has to succeed in the market and we participate in that risk and in the upside as that business grows that’s different from most of our traditional relationships because of course in a traditional situation where we are just replacing a legacy environment there generally aren’t really ambitious growth plans because they are starting from a large base in this case they are starting from no premiums with the ambitions to grow them substantially from there and the relationship that we structured has us participating in that growth rishi jaluria okay got it thank you and one quick followup if i could squeeze it in for richard you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are seeing an increasing amount of license being ratable versus term can you give us a sense just directionally how that number has been trending and maybe what sort of portion of license revenue is ratable versus term richard hart so we are at the very beginning stages of this very long what i believe will be a very long and transformation of the pl model and right now i think you should understand that ratable revenues are well below  still when they go above  in the form of subscription revenues i think you should expect us to actually break it out but when i talk about next year what i want to make sure i emphasize is that there’s a certain amount of uncertainty with regard to how many transactions actually take the form of a ratable license and when they fall because those two things the number the amount and the timing of those transactions create a little bit of uncertainty obviously because our term license model allows us to recognize all of the license for any particular year upfront so what i was referring to is that now – i think now we feel ready to disclose that we are in kind of an active phase of transitioning although we feel that that transition will be very gradual and will last a long time rishi jaluria okay got it that’s very helpful thanks so much marcus and richard marcus ryu thank you operator we will take our next question from ian strgar with ubs please go ahead ian strgar good afternoon guys so you guys posted not quite  million of upside to total revenues in the third quarter and i understand that some of that was pulled out of the fourth quarter with a large tier  expansion but can you guys just comment on how – since this was only one tier  expansion that led to significant upside in the third quarter can you guys just comment on what the tier  pipeline for the fourth quarter looks like and whether there is any room for upside surprises there richard hart so if i may that it’s very difficult for us and we definitely don’t want to be put in a position where we are talking about our pipeline on a tiered basis we have conversations with tier  customers all the time not only for initial sales but for followon sales and they can fall in any – with some variability or even with a certain kind of a lack of certainty in this particular case we were able to pull it upfront but i think it would be a mistake to consider that this transaction was unforeseen upside right we have started getting a very good idea of what this transaction would look like very early in the year and the uncertainty was whether or not we would be able to close it before the end of the quarter that does not mean that we have in our back pocket  million of additional bookings that’s the figure you mentioned in the fourth quarter and we would urge people not to think that those kinds – these kinds of transactions happen on a daily basis for us marcus ryu yes i would – i stand behind everything richard just said of course and it’s worth pointing out that this transaction this particular customer is somewhat anomalous but of course we have active conversations going with insurers of all sizes and a lot of emphasis with the very biggest insurers as well and there are some – a number of those relationships that we hope to bring to contract over the next few periods we have always emphasized the fact that it’s not merely a matter of winning a mandate but with how that mandate is structured with the customer and sometimes we have a very promising relationship that starts out quite small and then there are cases where they start out much larger than that and that variability is also a point of negotiation and therefore of uncertainty so we have the kind of probability weight all of that in giving guidance and that’s what you see reflected the fact that this one transaction closed earlier is very helpful in terms of derisking our outlook with respect to what we have guided to in the past but of course we are actively at work in multiple other discussions that we hope to bring to closure too ian strgar okay understood can you guys update us on the accenture partnership in continental europe and how that’s helping you in that geography marcus ryu yes i think that’s – it’s an active partnership we have examples of projects underway as well as some that have achieved meaningful golive milestones i would say we are partnering as effectively with them as we have with all our partners over the years with notable caveat that our relationship with accenture is really confined to relationships outside of the us – with the customer relationship outside the us which we’ve been able to make work just fine while they are an extremely capable firm and we are glad to have them allies with us they have limited power to really change the timetable of big decisions but they are – it’s very helpful to have their presence in country with automated language speakers and people who know the local industry in terms of comforting a customer that we can see their project all the way through their success that’s very helpful and we expect to rely on them more heavily over time ian strgar thanks guys marcus ryu thank you operator and we will take our next question from alex zukin with piper jaffray please go ahead taylor reiners hi guys this is taylor reiners on for alex i just wanted to dig in a little bit more on insurancenow how are you segmenting opportunities well both insurancenow and insurancesuite might be appropriate like in tier  and tier  customers and how did the asps between the two differ marcus ryu right so as i think it’s embedded in your question you appreciate that in most cases it’s very clear very large complex insurer that can only implement one domain at a time will clearly be for – only for insurancesuite and of course that’s any insurer today it’s outside the us we would only have insurancesuite to offer whereas a smaller line of business a smaller insurer that is prepared or is requiring us to implement all three domains policy claims and billing at the same time and wants it in the cloud is very well suited for insurancenow and in between there are some gray area and judgment i think the biggest considerations are do they want it deployed in the cloud as that kind of service or do they have an it organization capability comfort that they wanted in their traditional data center and companies are generally pretty clear about their preference from that score and then how prepared are they to conform to a somewhat narrower path with insurancenow in terms of degree of the freedom on their implementation insurancesuite by its design is an extremely flexible and general product that’s how we have been able to support customers of all sizes in  different countries all over the world and insurancenow is a bit more narrowly targeted and that has in some cases a great advantage because it’s a closer strength to the finish line for them to this – of a project but sometimes it also constrains what a customer may want and in that gray area we have to make a judgment call once we understand the customer’s requirement about which solution they need that i think the vast majority of the time when you apply this criteria it will be straightforward which one applies and then our sales team is perfectly capable of now positioning either taylor reiners got it that makes sense then just a quick followup when we are looking at – how should we think about how increased execution in – for insurancenow could affect margins next year potentially boost free cash flow and what – i am just wondering how you are thinking about that richard hart i think it’s just a little bit early to tell i think that question falls into the buckets that we mentioned before about trying to understand how the configuration of transactions is likely to develop next year and we are still working on developing our judgment around that and we will be ready to talk about that on our q call taylor reiners got it thanks guys operator and we will take our next question from justin furby with william blair please go ahead vinay mohan this is actually vinay on for justin i had  quick questions one just following up on the large tier  deal that came in earlier did all of that come in this quarter or was there some contribution that’s left for the next quarter and then i had a followup marcus ryu yes not to be specific about quarter to quarter i can tell you that there’s a great deal more in this relationship that we hope to continue to evolve this isn’t – it’s far from the entirety of our offering it is a very material and substantial commitment that they have made to the next phase of their relationship with us and we have to execute on that and make further progress before i think a comparably sized expansion would be on the horizon but if you compare the distance from the first to the second stage of that – of our relationship with this customer it’s tracking pretty well now to our track record when we deliver on our promises in the first chapter richard hart and to be specific we don’t anticipate recognizing any license amounts from this transaction until next year at around this time and what you may see is there’s a small incremental increase in annual license payments for this particular customer what we call ramp structure although the ramp structure here is – features a much more modest incline than we might have for some of our other transactions and obviously the maintenance portion of this transaction will be recognized ratably throughout the next four quarters vinay mohan got it makes sense marcus i just wanted to kind of followup on eagle eye and just analytics in general if you could provide some color on kind of what kind of insurers are buying it how does it overlap with what verisk is doing and then if you could maybe add some color on the opportunity on the data side longer term that will be helpful marcus ryu yes it’s quite a complex topic with many dimensions to it specifically with respect to eagle eye i think we have been learning not so much – how much –how the product works but how to represent it in a way that’s most digestible and valuable to customers and one of the conclusions we have come to is that what insurers would really want to see is predictive analytics applied in a very actionable sense to a set of decisions that they know that they can move the needle on and that would have economic value when they do move that needle and so – and there’s a preference for seeing that kind of tangible application as opposed to seeing a very general analytics platform however sophisticated so what we are doing with eagle eye which we now call guidewire predictive analytics is really applying it decision by decision to key points in the process that are supported by insurancesuite across both claims and policy and bringing it right to the knowledge worker that happen to make that decision that they have – they can have a more informed choice in some cases score and some kind of a set of criteria that are put in front of them in some cases an automated decision and then – and really activating the predictive analytics that way we are pretty early with this process and i think it’s been very well received but the proof will be when we can – we have multiple customers applying it this way and kind of moving from decision to decision as they are – and applying this kind of approach now the other part of your question was generally about data historically we are not a data provider right our systems manage enormous volumes of data for our customers and now predictive analytics analyzes that data and mines it for predictive insight but we ourselves don’t broker data we don’t have our own large repository of data that we sell back to customers and so forth we see – our role so far has been mostly a software company providing the tools to create structure visualize and manage that data that could change over time but that has not been our core business so far and it’s not something that – it requires a certain scale as you know to be meaningful there because there are so many different varieties of data that are relevant here and just having one or two is kind of a dubious value we don’t see ourselves as competitive with verisk they are a very important partner to us we have conformed policy center in the us to work very much to their industry standard and that’s been helpful and appreciated by customers so – and we see ourselves as very complementary to them and certainly with respect to selling data as such we don’t – we have not done that to date vinay mohan got it and then just one last followup for richard if i can richard do you think the normalized bookings growth rate going forward may be a bit faster than  given that iscs kind of opens up more opportunity down market richard hart it’s very hard for me to say exactly how much iscs is going to promote bookings next year versus insurancesuite or any of the other kind of products obviously we look at this as a portfolio approach and we look at having all of the tools in our bag as necessary for – to continue to grow with the pace that we have been growing vinay mohan kind of makes sense thanks a lot guys richard hart thank you operator and we will take our next question from brad sills with bank of americamerrill lynch please go ahead brad sills hi guys thanks for taking my question just one on digital and data please it seems like you are getting your stride there with that business is there something about the starting motion where you feel like you have kind of got execution down here in that business where you kind of hit the sweet spot of positioning that sort of offering to account a little bit of color please on that would be helpful thank you very much marcus ryu yes thanks brad a number of things i think have come together very well here obviously there is endmarket demand right the world is changing and end markets – our customers end customers are behaving in what they prefer to see that is catalyzing a sense of urgency on the part of our customers for data and digital solutions so that’s obviously very helpful i think we have executed well on the product side in being able to recognize those requirements turn them around into compelling products and then also really connect those products to the data and the process that’s substantiated in the core in insurancesuite and i think we were a bit earlier than certainly many of our competitors and others in recognizing how important this would be and then actually building products that work and then making really customers successful so i feel pretty proud of the early approach that we took there and i have seen that work and then the third thing i think working quite well is the sales and gotomarket model where we now have effectively an overlay team for these newer products that keeps an ongoing relationship with existing customers some of the moving customers for us – with us for a very long time and have been able to deepen the relationship and motivate the case for implementing a data or digital product from us and that’s encouraging not only in its own right because of these products but because it represents another important growth factor for us as a business or maybe the most important growth factor for us longer term which is that we can bring new solutions to market and be in a very advantaged and trusted position with our customers because they are using our core application to run their business brad sills great thanks marcus operator and we will take our last question from sterling auty with jpmorgan please go ahead sterling auty great thanks guys i apologize if these were answered but i got cut off for a little bit i think you mentioned for metlife that the greenfield was in a new business area i am just – i just want to clarify what lines of insurance are being covered by the greenfield opportunity what lines of insurance are being covered in the old model marcus ryu right so the greenfield opportunity – their newer lines of business are still personal lines focused but they are different versions different – digitalonly or digitalfirst kinds of products that have been kind of reconceived repackaged repriced redesigned in terms of their coverages and limits and so forth for the digital consumer and their start will be – the r of the project was on the homeowners line but it’s soon to be followed by a personal auto and by umbrella and by other lines of business as well and in the insurance world not all products that cover the same kinds of risks are the same so you can talk about personal auto insurance can look very different it’s very different products that cover that same underlying risk depending on how it’s priced structured defined segmented and sold and what metlife has done is now approaching the market in a – i think a different quite innovative way to – with a very specific market focus and a different kind of distribution and service model sterling auty and what is the technical architecture for this i think you mentioned that – i think it’s being delivered through aws so as you talk about other possible customer wins is this single tenant just by its nature or is this something that eventually could become multitenant marcus ryu it is single tenant by its nature and that’s a very strong preference not only of this customer but we think of all customers because we are dealing with missioncritical data they have their own kind of proprietary configuration of the system and in many cases they have adapted it considerably to instantiate what they think of as their competitive advantage in the case of metlife i think they have done a number of very innovative things arm and arm with us on the digital front but what they have – the underlying product there is insurancesuite the same product that we have implemented now for hundreds of other customers it’s now deployed on aws and managed and delivered by us but the underlying software and what will be on the same upgrade path as all of our other customers is the insurancesuite code base and that’s our intention with any other customer that may follow in the same thing sterling auty that makes sense richard on the ratable comments are we talking about ratable being more because you are expecting more of these greenfield type of opportunities and more insurancenow in terms of the mix are you saying that you are starting to see a bigger preference or maybe you are motivating the move towards traditional insurancesuite purchases being in a ratable fashion richard hart so it’s a little bit hard to read the signals from the market with any kind of fidelity at this point in time but what i will say is that the number of people that are interested in chatting with us about kind of a cloud delivered format for insurancesuite gives rise to the question of how many of those customers will want to have the solution delivered to them that way next year or the year after and those solutions will be recognized ratably in addition insurancenow underwriting management predictive analytics all of these solutions are recognized ratably as opposed to our more traditional core system sales and that mix is a little bit hard to prejudge at this moment in time but i believe – and it’s only a belief is that the dial will only turn one way that is towards an increasing amount of our new license sales being recognized ratably and the speed of that transition – and i believe it will be slow and incremental but the speed of that transition may affect to some degree how much of revenue we can recognize within a particular period sterling auty that’s fair and last question – yes that makes sense last question is given the early close in the tier  deal can you just comment then to your visibility in the guidance that you have given for the fourth quarter because that’s closer that could be a more visibility less or the same marcus ryu given the substantial more visibility as you would guess sterling and there is still business that we have to get closed and like any other period there are opportunities and upside that we are pursuing as well but when you look a transaction of this size having it fully executed a quarter early is a great help in being confident in the outlook for the entire year richard hart we have taken a big chunk that we had the probability weight in some way and taken it out of the equation and so now that q has a much more normal kind of mix of transactions and we are only a quarter out those two things help with visibility in and of themselves sterling auty great thank you richard hart thank you operator and that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would like to turn the conference back over to marcus ryu for any additional or closing remarks marcus ryu no other commentary thank you everyone for participating in our call today goodbye operator and that concludes
