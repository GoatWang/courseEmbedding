fund         stone ridge high yield reinsurance risk premium fund         financial statements and notes         expense example         additional information         shareholder letter            dear shareholder at stone ridge we believe that markets work centuries of financial history have shown that markets reward investors for the capital they supply and the risks they bear competition quickly drives prices to fair value leaving only risk premium consistent with this approach we purposefully put our portfolios in harms way taking on intelligent and diversified risks  the most reliable way we know to build long term wealth stone ridge specializes in creating exposure to difficult to access and potentially valuable risks including the reinsurance risks that drive returns in our reinsurance funds while thankfully most days the planet does not endure catastrophic earthquakes or hurricanes the reality is that any bond we hold in the portfolio could go to zero overnight it is this jump to default risk that we believe provides much of the expected return in our reinsurance portfolios our funds incorporate an intellectually coherent and scientific approach to portfolio construction we do not believe we can effectively add value by selecting individual securities instead we carefully and systematically screen for adverse selection and compose highly diversified portfolios any returns the funds earn are a function of the substantial risks they bear there are no shortcuts free lunches or easy solutions as zealots for detail every member of the stone ridge team is proud of the care craftsmanship and quality we put into every product we design we are grateful for the trust you have shown by your investment in the stone ridge family of risk premium funds ross

company act of  the  act as amended as an openend management investment company issuing shares in series each series representing a distinct portfolio with its own investment objectives and policies as of april   the trust consisted of two series the funds the stone ridge reinsurance risk premium fund the reinsurance fund and the stone ridge high yield reinsurance risk premium fund the high yield fund both funds began operations on february   the funds each offer two classes of shares to investors class i shares with no frontend or backend sales charges no b fees and no redemption fee and the class m shares with no frontend or backend sales charges a  b fee and no redemption fee there are an unlimited number of authorized shares the investment objective of both funds is to seek a high level of total return consisting of income and capital appreciation two additional series of the trust the stone ridge us variance risk premium fund and the stone ridge us small cap variance risk premium fund were incepted on april   and commenced operations on may   an additional series of the trust the stone ridge us master variance risk premium fund commenced operations on may    summary of significant accounting policies the following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the trust in the preparation of its financial statements the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap a use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates b indemnifications in the normal course of business the funds enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations which provide general indemnifications the funds maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be known however the funds expect any risk of loss to be remote c federal income taxes the funds intend to qualify as regulated investment companies under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended if so qualified the funds will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent they distribute substantially all of their net investment income and capital gains to shareholders therefore no federal income tax provision is required d eventlinked bonds eventlinked bonds are variable rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events that leads to economic andor human loss such as an earthquake of a particular magnitude or a hurricane of a specific category the most common type of eventlinked bonds is known as catastrophe or cat bonds in most cases the trigger events will not be deemed to have occurred unless the events happened in a particular geographic area and was of a certain magnitude based on independent scientific readings or caused a certain amount of actual or modeled loss if the trigger events occurs prior to a bonds maturity the funds may lose all or a portion of its principal and forgo additional interest in this regard eventlinked bonds typically have a special condition that states that if the issuer ie an insurance or reinsurance company suffers a loss from a particular predefined catastrophe then the issuers obligation to pay interest andor repay the principal is either deferred or completely forgiven for example if a fund holds a bond which covers an insurers losses due to a hurricane with a trigger at  billion and a hurricane hits causing  billion or more in losses to such insurer then the fund will lose all or a portion of its principal invested in the bond and forgo any future interest payments if the trigger events does not occur the fund will recover its principal plus interest interest typically accrues and is paid on a quarterly basis although principal typically is repaid only on the maturity date it may be repaid in installments depending on the terms of the bond the funds may invest in eventlinked bonds directly or indirectly through certain derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are derivative instruments that are typically contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events trigger events include hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena      stone ridge funds       semiannual report       april                      notes to financial statements unaudited     april       e quota shares quota shares are a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurers portfolio according to a predefined percentage for example under a  quotashare agreement a special purpose vehicle spv would obtain  of all premiums of the subject portfolio while being responsible for  of all claims and the fund as holder of a quota share note issued by the spv would be entitled to its pro rata share of the premiums received by the spv and would be responsible for its pro rata share of the claims up to the total amount invested f distributions to shareholders the funds intend to distribute to their shareholders any net investment income and any net realized long or shortterm capital gains if any at least annually distributions are recorded on exdividend date the funds each may periodically make reclassifications among certain of their capital accounts as a result of the characterization of certain income and realized gains determined annually in accordance with federal tax regulations that may differ from generally accepted accounting principals g foreign currency transactions the funds books and records are maintained in us dollars foreign currency denominated transactions ie market value of investment securities assets and liabilities purchases and sales of investment securities and income and expenses are translated into us dollars at the current rate of exchange the funds do not isolate that portion of results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held such fluctuations are included within the net realized and unrealized gain from investments h allocation of income expenses gainslosses income expenses other than those deemed attributable to a specific share class and gains and losses of each fund are allocated daily to each share class based up the ratio of net assets represented by each class as a percentage of the net assets of each fund expenses deemed directly attributable to a class of shares are recorded by the specific class most expenses are allocated based on average net assets with the exception of b fees which are expensed at  of average daily net assets of the class m shares i other investment transactions are recorded on the trade date dividend income less any foreign tax withheld is recognized on the exdividend date and interest income is recognized on an accrual basis including amortizationaccretion of premiums or discounts discounts and premiums on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective securities using the constant yield method net investment income other than class specific expenses and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated daily to each class of shares based upon the relative net asset value of outstanding shares of each class of shares at the beginning of the day j restricted securities the funds may invest a substantial portion of their assets in securities that are restricted but eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended as well as other restricted securities restricted securities may be resold in transactions that are exempt from registration under federal securities laws or if the securities are publically registered restricted securities may be deemed illiquid  investment valuation and fair value measurement in determining the net asset value nav of the funds shares securities which are traded on a domestic national stock exchange are valued at the last sale price each day on the securities exchange on which the securities are primarily traded securities traded principally on the nasdaq stock market are normally valued at the nasdaq official closing price nocp provided by nasdaq each business day exchangetraded securities for which there were no transactions are valued at the mean between the closing bid and asked prices nonexchange traded equity securities are valued at the mean price in the overthecounter market if a nonexchange traded equity does not trade on a particular day the mean between the closing bid and asked prices is used investment in mutual funds including money market funds are generally priced at the ending net asset value nav provided by the service agent of the trust and will be classified as level  debt securities with a remaining maturity in excess of  days including corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities eventlinked bonds collateralized mortgage obligation loans and other asset backed securities are valued     stone ridge funds       semiannual report       april                       notes to financial statements unaudited     april       using the mean between the closing bid and asked prices provided by either a pricing service or two independent brokers debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than  days are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value debt securities valued using these techniques and inputs are categorized as level  of the fair value hierarchy in the event that the trusts pricing vendor is unable to provide two independent broker quotes for eventlinked bonds catastrophe bonds the advisor will engage an independent data delivery vendor to obtain firm bids from two independent brokers or from a market maker in the security on a weekly basis and on the last business day of each month eventlinked bonds valued using these techniques and inputs are categorized as level  of the fair value hierarchy exchangetraded options are generally valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations on the exchange at closing exchangetraded options may also be valued at its national best bid and offer nbbo from participant exchanges over the counter options not traded on an exchange are valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations options valued using these techniques and inputs are categorized as level  of the fair value hierarchy participation notes quota shares are valued on a weekly basis and on the last day of each month these instruments are valued based upon nonpublically available market quotations obtained from a thirdparty broker preference shares quota shares are fair valued by the advisers valuation committee on a weekly basis and the last day of each month using models created by the adviser quota shares will be valued more frequently if there are significant events during the course of a week that could affect the value of the instrument quota shares will generally be classified as level  investments securities for which market quotations are not readily available are fair valued by the adviser valuation committee the committee under the oversight of the board of trustees valuation committee in determining the method to be used to determine the fair value of a portfolio security the committee considers the securities and exchange commission sec guidance as set forth in accounting series release no  october   and no  december   and other communications from the sec no single standard for determining fair value can be set forth because fair value depends upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case each fair value determination is based upon a consideration of such factors and circumstances as the committee deems relevant which may include some or all of the following i fundamental analytical data relating to the security including financial statements and analysts report ii the type of security size of the holding in the portfolio original cost and pricing history iii the nature and duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the security iv the forces that influence the market in which the security trades v the value of other financial securities ie derivatives exchangetraded funds adrs and closedend funds that are traded on other markets or among dealers vi the liquidity or illiquidity of the market for the particular portfolio security vii the value of similar securities of the issuer or comparable companies viii values of baskets of securities traded in other markets ix changes in interest rates x foreign currency exchange activity xi observations from financial institutions xii foreign or domestic government pronouncements or actions xiii relevant news events xiv whether the same or similar portfolio securities are held by other funds managed by the adviser and the method used to price the security in those funds xv an analysis of the companys financial statements xvi the existence of extraordinary market circumstances xvii with respect to debt securities the maturity coupon credit worthiness currency denomination and movement of the market in which the security is normally traded for the purpose of determining the fair value the committee may use a variety of valuation methodologies including i mathematical techniques that refer to the prices of similar or related securities ii a percentage increase or decrease across all securities of a region country or industry affected by a significant event iii a multiple of earnings iv a discount from the market value of a similar freelytraded security v a the yield to maturity of debt securities vi broker indications or single broker bids provided that such indications or bids may not be the sole basis for valuation determination vii mathematical models developed by independent third parties or viii any combination of the aforementioned securities valued by the committee are valued as level  of the fair value hierarchy the funds have adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value these standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion of changes in      stone ridge funds       semiannual report       april                      notes to financial statements unaudited     april        valuation techniques and related inputs during the period the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the fund has the ability to access at the measurement date level  significant inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active level  significant inputs that are unobservable inputs are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation decisions including assumptions about risk a financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement however the determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgment by the trust the trust considers observable data to be that market data which is readily available regularly distributed or updated reliable and verifiable not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market the categorization of a financial instrument within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and does not necessarily correspond to the trusts perceived risk of that instrument there were no transfers between level  and level  during the reporting period transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting

foreign investment risk the funds may invest in eventlinked securities issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities because the majority of eventlinked security issuers are domiciled outside the united states the funds will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in nonus entities certain spvs in which the funds invest may be sponsored by nonus ceding insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which us ceding insurers are subject such spvs may pose a greater risk of loss for example due to less stringent underwriting andor riskretention requirements the funds investments will consist primarily of eventlinked bonds which provide the funds with contractual rights under the terms of the bond issuance while the contractual rights of eventlinked bonds issued are similar whether they are issued by a us issuer or a nonus issuer there may be certain additional risks

shares the “shares” the fund is operated as an “interval fund” as defined below an investment in the fund may not be appropriate for all investors stone ridge asset management llc “stone ridge” or the “adviser” is the fund’s investment adviser the offering shares of the fund are being offered initially at an offering price of  per share the shares are expected to be offered on a continuous basis thereafter at net asset value “nav” per share there is no minimum number of shares by all investors in the aggregate required to be purchased in the initial offering or any subsequent offering proceeds from the offering will be held by the fund’s custodian upon commencement of investment operations the fund will initially cap its total assets at  billion an “initial cap” once the initial cap is met the fund will no longer accept new investors and only the reinvestment of dividends by existing investors will be permitted following the initial launch the fund may reopen to new investors and may subsequently close again at any time at the discretion of the adviser irrespective of the initial cap amount in addition upon commencement of investment operations the fund will be made available for investment on a priority basis to a group of investors the “consortium” who have participated in educational sessions regarding the fund and the asset class in which it invests if capacity allows once orders are fulfilled for the consortium the fund will then be available for investment by other investors the fund may also prioritize and allocate capacity to the consortium upon any subsequent reopening of the fund the consortium members do not have any special rights to offering price dividends or liquidation the consortium is expected to consist of a selected group of rias who have discretionary authority to invest on their clients’ behalf and a fiduciary duty to their clients and with whom the adviser has a previous relationship members of the consortium and their clients are not obligated to invest in the fund the fund’s shares are offered through quasar distributors llc the “distributor” as the exclusive distributor on a best efforts basis the minimum initial investment is  million subject to certain exceptions the fund reserves the right to reject a purchase order for any reason see “shareholder guide — how to buy shares” shareholders will not have the right to redeem their shares however as described below in order to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund will conduct periodic repurchase offers for a portion of its outstanding shares the fund will only sell shares to or through fiduciaries such as rias or retirement plans or institutional investors or to employees directors and affiliates of the fund or the adviser periodic repurchase offers the fund is an “interval fund” a type of fund which in order to provide liquidity to shareholders has adopted a fundamental investment policy to make quarterly offers to repurchase between  and  of its outstanding      shares at nav subject to applicable law and approval of the board for each quarterly repurchase offer the fund currently expects to offer to repurchase  of the fund’s outstanding shares at nav which is the minimum amount permitted the fund will make quarterly repurchase offers in the months of february may august and november written notification of each quarterly repurchase offer the “repurchase offer notice” will be sent to shareholders at least  calendar days before the repurchase request deadline ie the date by which shareholders can tender their shares in response to a repurchase offer the “repurchase request deadline” the fund’s shares are not listed on any securities exchange and the fund anticipates that no secondary market will develop for its shares accordingly you may not be able to sell shares when andor in the amount that you desire thus the shares are appropriate only as a longterm investment in addition the fund’s repurchase offers may subject the fund and shareholders to special risks see “principal risks of the fund — repurchase offers risk” investment objective and principal investment policies the fund’s investment objective is to achieve total return and current income there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective the adviser believes that investing should involve a longterm view and a systematic focus on sources of expected return not on security selection or market timing in managing the fund the adviser focuses primarily on one source of expected returns the “credit risk premium” in certain loans and other investments described below the “credit risk premium” is positive if interest payments paid in connection with a pool of such investments minus the principal losses actually experienced across that pool exceed the risk free rate on average and over time the “riskfree rate” is the rate of return that can be earned on highquality shortterm government debt securities there can be no assurance that the credit risk premium will be positive for the fund’s investments at any time or on average and over time for example a consumer or small business borrower typically pays a premium interest to a lender in exchange for use of the lender’s capital the amount of the borrowing for a predetermined amount of time on average and over time if payments of interest and repayments of principal on such borrowings are greater than losses incurred from defaults the excess positive return represents the credit premium by investing in these loans and other investments the fund is accepting the risk that some borrowers will not repay their loans in exchange for the expected returns associated with the receipt of interest payments and repayment of principal by those that do the fund seeks to benefit over the longterm from the difference between the amount of interest and principal received and losses experienced the adviser will not purchase or sell investments for the fund’s portfolio based on an analysis of specific borrowers’ abilities to repay their loans or other criteria specific to individual securities instead the adviser seeks to identify alternative lending platforms that originate pools of loans and other securities on an ongoing basis that can be purchased by the fund and serve as part of a portfolio that will provide the fund with broad exposure to the risk and return characteristics and potential credit risk premium of loans from a variety of geographic regions and representing a variety of different borrower types for a variety of loan purposes including but not limited to     •   individual consumers consolidating existing debt or funding large purchases     •   small or mediumsized businesses funding working capital such as property plant equipment expansion receivables or inventory     •   students financing education or refinancing existing student loans the fund has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies that can only be changed with the approval of the holders of a majority of the fund’s outstanding voting securities the “fundamental investment restrictions”     •   the fund may not invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment        •   the fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities from platforms whose business consists primarily of originating loans of subprime quality     •   the fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities originated in emerging markets     •   the fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities from platforms whose financial statements are not audited by a nationally recognized accounting firm as described in more detail below under “alternative lending” an “alternative lending platform” is a lending marketplace or lender that is not a traditional lender such as a bank the adviser as part of its portfolio construction process performs diligence on the platforms from which the fund purchases alternative lendingrelated securities in order to evaluate both the process by which each platform extends loans to borrowers and provides related services and the characteristics of the overall portfolio of loans made available through that platform the fund generally purchases a portfolio of loans from a particular platform that meet certain criteria such as maturities and durations borrower and loan types borrower credit quality and geographic locations of borrower and that provide broad exposure to that particular platform’s loan originations the fund will invest solely in loans originated by platforms that will provide the fund with a written commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered individual loanlevel data on an ongoing basis throughout the life of each individual loan that is updated periodically as often as the nav is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or loan and the fund will not invest in loans sold on platforms for which the fund cannot evaluate to its satisfaction the completeness and accuracy of the individual loan data relevant to the existence and valuation of the loans purchased that is provided by the platform and used by the fund in accounting for loans although the fund conducts diligence on the platforms the fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information provided by the platforms other than payment information regarding loans and other alternative lendingrelated securities owned by the fund which the fund will observe directly as payments are received the fund generally will not have access to personally identifiable information about the individual borrowers eg names or similar identifying information prior to purchasing loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities although the fund’s custodian will have this information for whole loans owned by the fund and the fund and the adviser have established procedures with the fund’s custodian designed to prevent the inadvertent communication of personally identifiable borrower information by the fund’s custodian to the fund or the adviser the fund will monitor the characteristics of the alternative lendingrelated securities purchased from particular platforms on an ongoing basis in this way the adviser seeks to construct a portfolio that provides broad representative investment exposure across the alternative lending asset class the adviser will determine whether loans offered to the fund are of subprime quality at the time of investment pursuant to guidelines approved by the board from time to time these guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the fund the adviser must determine that loans have a likelihood of repayment that is greater than that of “subprime” consumer loans “subprime” does not have a specific legal or market definition but is understood in the credit marketplace to signify that a loan has a material likelihood that it will not be repaid the adviser will make the determination that loans purchased by the fund are not of subprime quality based on the adviser’s due diligence of the credit underwriting policies of the originating platform which look to a number of borrowerspecific factors to determine a borrower’s ability to repay a particular loan including employments status income assets education and credit bureau data where available although credit bureau data is only one factor considered in determining the credit quality of a borrower and a loan when fico data is available with respect to a borrower the adviser’s guidelines do not allow the adviser to cause the fund to purchase any consumer loan to an individual whose fico score is below  at the time of origination the fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in alternative lendingrelated securities either directly or through one or more whollyowned and controlled subsidiaries each a “subsidiary” formed by the fund these securities typically provide the fund with exposure to loans originated by alternative lending      platforms the fund will invest primarily in whole loans but also may invest to a lesser extent in other types of alternative lendingrelated securities which include     •   shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans including “memberdependent payment notes” issued by some public us platforms which we refer to as “fractional loans” herein     •   securities issued by special purpose entities that hold either of the foregoing types of alternative lendingrelated securities “assetbacked securities”     •   equity or debt securities publicly or privately offered including warrants of alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms     •   derivative instruments which may include options swaps or other derivatives that provide exposure to any of the investments the fund may make directly the fund may gain exposure directly or indirectly to loans that are unsecured secured by a perfected security interest in an enterprise or specific assets of an enterprise or individual borrower andor supported by a personal guarantee by individuals related to the borrower the loans to which the fund will gain exposure may pay fixed or variable rates of interest may have a variety of amortization schedules may include borrowings that do not require amortization payments ie are interestonly and may have a term ranging from less than one year to thirty years or longer this universe of investments is subject to change under varying market conditions and as alternative lendingrelated instruments and markets evolve over time under normal circumstances the fund will invest at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes directly or indirectly in alternative lendingrelated securities as a matter of fundamental policy the fund will concentrate its investments in the alternative lending industry the fund may seek to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risks that arise as a result of its investments the fund may use forwards futures swaps or other listed or overthecounter “otc” derivatives or may purchase or sell physical currency bonds or other securities including short sales on assets the fund does not own which may require the fund to pay a premium to borrow the assets sold short and to pay the lender any dividends or interest received on the assets while borrowed there can be no guarantee the fund’s hedging activities will effectively offset any adverse impact of foreign exchange or interest rates in implementing the fund’s investment strategy the adviser has broad discretion to invest in alternative lendingrelated securities of different types and relating to a variety of borrower types and geographic regions including regions inside and outside the us subject to the fundamental investment restrictions which prohibit the fund from investing in loans of subprime quality or loans originated in emerging markets initially the adviser expects to seek to invest in alternative lendingrelated securities through platforms that operate in and that originate loans to borrowers located in the us europe australia and new zealand and may in the future seek to gain exposure to other geographic regions other than emerging markets within each region and borrower type the adviser has broad discretion to invest in securities that provide the fund with a variety of exposures including to borrower creditworthiness lines of business and loan purpose subject to any restrictions under applicable law including diversification requirements under us federal income tax law applicable to regulated investment companies the fund is not restricted in its exposure to any particular borrower creditworthiness line of business loan purpose term or form of security or guarantee or any other loan terms or characteristics except as provided in the fundamental investment restrictions there is no stated limit on the percentage of assets the fund can invest in a particular investment or the percentage of assets the fund will allocate to any one loan type borrower type loan purpose geographic region borrower creditworthiness term or form of security or guarantee permitted by the fundamental investment restrictions the fund may at times focus its investments in instruments meeting one or more of these criteria      the fund may make investments in alternative lendingrelated securities directly or indirectly through one or more subsidiaries each subsidiary may invest for example in whole loans or in shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans or any other security that the fund may hold directly references herein to the fund include references to a subsidiary in respect of the fund’s exposure to alternative lendingrelated securities in addition the fund may directly or indirectly invest in andor sell certain of its alternative lendingrelated investments to special purpose entities formed by third parties for the purpose of acquiring alternative lendingrelated investments and issuing securities the payments on which are funded by payments received on such entities’ underlying investments such assetbacked securities may be issued in different tranches of debt and equity interests with different rights and preferences the fund may hold any tranche of such assetbacked securities there is generally a limited secondary market available for many of the securities in which the fund will invest and as a result the fund generally will hold investments to maturity as described below the fund may sell certain of its investments to securitization vehicles and to the extent a more active secondary market develops over time the fund may selectively purchase or sell loans in executing its investment strategy leverage the fund may obtain leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective the fund or a subsidiary of the fund may obtain financing to make investments in alternative lendingrelated securities the fund expects that borrowings by the fund or a fund’s subsidiary will be secured by alternative lendingrelated securities held by the fund or such subsidiary the fund may also obtain leverage through derivative instruments that afford the fund economic leverage or other investments such as assetbacked securities that may have embedded leverage the fund is not limited in the form or manner in which it may incur leverage the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” requires a closedend fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than  of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness as defined in the  act this means that the value of the fund’s senior securities representing indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including such senior securities measured at the time the fund issues the senior securities investments or trading practices that involve contractual obligations to pay in the future are subject to the same requirements unless the fund designates liquid assets in an amount the fund believes to be equal to the fund’s contractual obligations markedtomarket on a daily basis or appropriately “covers” such obligations with offsetting positions leverage can have the effect of magnifying the fund’s exposure to changes in the value of its assets and may also result in increased volatility in the fund’s nav this means the fund will have the potential for greater gains as well as the potential for greater losses than if the fund owned its assets on an unleveraged basis the value of an investment in the fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent that the fund is exposed to leverage directly or indirectly alternative lending alternative lending which is sometimes referred to as peertopeer lending online lending or marketplace lending is a method of financing in which an alternative lending platform facilitates the borrowing and lending of money while generally not relying on deposits for capital to fund loans it is considered an alternative to more traditional debt financing done through a bank there are several different models of alternative lending but very generally a platform typically matches consumers small or mediumsized businesses or other types of borrowers with investors that are interested in gaining investment exposure to the loans made to such borrowers prospective borrowers are usually required to provide or give access to certain financial information to the      platform such as the intended purpose of the loan income employment information credit score debttoincome ratio credit history including defaults and delinquencies and home ownership status and in the case of small business loans business financial statements and personal credit information regarding any guarantor some of which information is made available to prospective lenders often platforms charge fees to borrowers to cover these screening and administrative costs based on this and other relevant supplemental information the platform usually assigns its own credit rating to the borrower and sets the interest rate for the requested borrowing platforms then post the borrowing requests online and investors may choose among the loans based on the interest rates the loans are expected to yield less any servicing or origination fees charged by the platform or others involved in the lending arrangement the background data provided on the borrowers and the credit rating assigned by the platform in some cases a platform partners with a bank to originate a loan to a borrower after which the bank sells the loan to the platform alternatively some platforms may originate loans themselves some investors including the fund may not review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general criteria of the investments as described above as a result the fund is dependent on the platforms’ ability to collect verify and provide information to the fund about each loan and borrower platforms may set minimum eligibility standards for borrowers to participate in alternative lending arrangements and may limit the maximum permitted borrowings depending on the purpose and nature of the loan its term may for example be as short as six months or shorter or as long as thirty years or longer set forth below is additional information about some of the fund’s alternative lendingrelated investments whole loans the fund will invest primarily in whole loans when the fund invests directly or indirectly in whole loans it will typically purchase all rights title and interest in the loans pursuant to a loan purchase agreement directly from the platform or its affiliate the platform or a thirdparty servicer typically continues to service the loans collecting payments and distributing them to investors less any servicing fees assessed against the fund and the servicing entity typically will make all decisions regarding acceleration or enforcement of the loans following any default by a borrower the fund expects to have a backup servicer in case any platform or affiliate of the platform ceases or fails to perform these servicing functions the fund as an investor in a whole loan would be entitled to receive payment only from the borrower andor any guarantor and would not be able to recover any deficiency from the platform except under very narrow circumstances which may include fraud by the borrower in some cases as described above the whole loans in which the fund may invest may be secured or unsecured shares certificates notes or other securities the fund may also invest directly or indirectly in shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans the platform or a separate special purpose entity organized by or on behalf of the platform may hold the whole loans underlying such securities on its books and issue to the fund as an investor a share certificate note or other security the payments on which track and depend upon the borrower payments on the underlying loans as with whole loans the platforms or thirdparty servicers typically continue to service the underlying loans on which the performance of such securities is based such securities may be linked to any of the types of whole loans in which the fund may invest directly such securities may also track fractions of a whole loan these securities may be sold through publicly registered offerings or through unregistered private offerings equity securities the fund may invest directly or indirectly in public or private equity securities issued by alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms including common stock preferred stock convertible stock andor warrants for example the fund may invest in securities issued by a platform which may provide the platform with the capital it requires to support its business equity investments may afford the fund voting rights as well as the opportunity to receive dividends andor capital appreciation although warrants which are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time typically have no voting rights receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to      the securities of the issuer unless and until they are exercised for the underlying equity securities the fund may also invest directly or indirectly in equity securities of both foreign and us small and midcap companies debt securities the fund may invest directly or indirectly in debt securities issued by alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms the fund may have exposure to the debt securities of us or foreign issuers these debt securities may have fixed or floating interest rates may or may not be collateralized and may be below investment grade or unrated but judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds” the fund has no limits as to the maturity of debt securities in which it invests directly or indirectly such investments may be within any maturity range short medium or long depending on the adviser’s evaluation of investment opportunities available within the debt securities market similarly the fund has no limits as to the market capitalization range of the issuers assetbacked securities the fund may invest in securitization vehicles that issue assetbacked securities which are debt securities backed by or residual equity interests in pools of alternative lendingrelated debt securities such a securitization vehicle may be formed by a platform a pooled investment vehicle or any other entity investment adviser stone ridge asset management llc is the investment adviser of the fund as of march   stone ridge managed approximately  billion of assets paul germain robert gutmann tomer seifan and ross stevens the “portfolio managers” are primarily responsible for the daytoday management of the fund in addition stone ridge performs initial and ongoing due diligence to evaluate the legal and regulatory frameworks and reputational aspects of the platforms from which the fund purchases alternative lendingrelated securities in that effort the portfolio managers are supported by benjamin lawsky stone ridge’s head of regulatory affairs and james rothwell stone ridge’s head of legal distributions the fund intends to declare and pay dividends of substantially all net investment income and net realized capital gains at least annually although the fund may declare and pay dividends more frequently eg quarterly unless shareholders specify otherwise dividends will be reinvested in shares of the fund the fund may pay distributions from sources that may not be available in the future and that are unrelated to the fund’s performance such as from offering proceeds borrowings and amounts from the fund’s affiliates that are subject to repayment by investors unlisted closedend fund structure limited liquidity the fund will not list its shares for trading on any securities exchange there is currently no secondary market for its shares and the fund does not expect any secondary market to develop for its shares shareholders of the fund are not able to have their shares redeemed or otherwise sell their shares on a daily basis because the fund is an unlisted closedend fund in order to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund is structured as an “interval fund” and conducts periodic repurchase offers for a portion of its outstanding shares as described herein an investment in the fund is suitable only for longterm investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of the shares investors should consider their investment goals time horizons and risk tolerance before investing in the fund distributor transfer agent and custodians quasar distributors llc of milwaukee wisconsin is the fund’s distributor us bancorp fund services llc of milwaukee wisconsin is the fund’s transfer agent administrator and accounting agent us bank na of      milwaukee wisconsin and millennium trust company llc “millennium” are the fund’s cocustodians millennium also serves as the custodian for assets held by the funds’ subsidiaries the fund compensates the distributor transfer agent and custodians for their services special risk considerations an investment in the fund involves special risk considerations you should consider carefully the risks summarized below which are described in more detail under “investment objective policies and risks — risk considerations” beginning on page  of this prospectus investors should carefully consider the fund’s risks and investment objective as an investment in the fund may not be appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program an investment in the fund involves a high degree of risk it is possible that investing in the fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested before making an investmentallocation decision investors should i consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investor’s or a client’s investment objectives and individual situation and ii consider factors such as an investor’s or a client’s net worth income age and risk tolerance investment should be avoided where an investorclient has a shortterm investing horizon andor cannot bear the loss of some or all of the investment default risk the value of the fund’s investments in whole loans and other alternative lendingrelated securities such as shares certificates notes or other securities representing an interest in and the right to receive principal and interest payments due on whole loans or fractions of whole loans is entirely dependent on the borrowers’ continued and timely payments the fund receives payments on such investments only if the party servicing the loans receives the borrower’s payments on the corresponding or underlying loan and passes such payments through to the fund if a borrower fails to make interest payments or repay principal when due on a loan in which the fund has investment exposure or if the value of such a loan decreases the value of the fund’s investments will be adversely affected there can be no assurance that payments due on underlying loans will be made if a borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason the fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal or interest due as among other reasons the fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated the loan may be unsecured or undercollateralized andor it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower if the fund were unable to recover unpaid principal or interest due this would cause the fund’s net asset value to decrease as described further under “risks of unsecured loans” the fund generally will not be able to offset losses on defaulting loans by looking to collateral or obligations of guarantors insurers or governmental authorities as many of the loans to which the fund will have exposure are obligations not secured by collateral or except for certain loans to businesses backed by any guarantee borrowings obtained through alternative lending platforms may not limit borrowers from incurring additional debt if a borrower incurs additional debt obligations after obtaining a loan through an alternative lending platform the borrower’s creditworthiness may diminish and any additional obligations could cause the borrower to experience financial distress insolvency or bankruptcy all of which would impair the borrower’s ability to repay the loan underlying the fund’s investment furthermore the ability of secured creditors to pursue remedies against the collateral of the borrower may impair the borrower’s ability to repay its unsecured loan or it may impair the platform’s or loan servicer’s ability to collect on the loan upon default the loans in which the fund invests generally will not include any crossdefault provisions crossdefault provisions render a default on one outstanding debt obligation an automatic default on another debt obligation of the borrower which permits creditors to react more quickly to take steps to protect their interests in contrast the loans in which the fund will      invest typically will be placed in default or referred to collection only if there are independent defaults on such loans irrespective of whether the borrower has defaulted on a different debt obligation not only will the fund not benefit from such protective provisions the fund also generally will not be made aware of any additional debt incurred by a borrower or whether such debt is secured or unsecured default rates on loans obtained through alternative lending platforms may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside the fund’s control such as economic downturns or general economic or political conditions including prevailing interest rates the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence residential real estate values the value of the various currencies energy prices changes in consumer spending the number of personal bankruptcies insolvencies disruptions in the credit markets the borrower’s personal circumstances and other factors the default history for alternative lending borrowing arrangements is limited future defaults may be higher than historical defaults and the timing of defaults may vary significantly from historical observations as described further under “creditcounterparty risk” the credit profile and interest rates available to certain borrowers who seek credit through alternative lending platforms may result in a higher rate of default for alternative lendingrelated securities as compared with the debt instruments associated with more traditional lending models such as banks although pursuant to the fundamental investment restrictions the fund will not invest in loans of subprime quality if the impact of defaults on loans to which the fund has exposure exceeds the profits on nondefaulting loans the fund will be unable to achieve its investment objective the fund’s investments in equity securities issued by the platforms themselves or their affiliates are also subject to the risk of loss if a platform defaults on its outstanding obligations the fund’s equity interest in the platform may be diminished or extinguished and the fund can expect to realize on any such investments only to the extent that the platform’s creditors are made whole and the platform still has residual profits that would benefit equity holders risk of unsecured loans many of the fund’s investments are associated with loans that are unsecured obligations of borrowers this means that they are not secured by any collateral not insured by any third party not backed by any governmental authority in any way and except in the case of certain loans to businesses not guaranteed by any third party when a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan the holder’s only recourse is generally to accelerate the loan and enter into litigation to recover the outstanding principal and interest there is no assurance that such litigation would result in full repayment of the loan and the costs of such measures may frequently exceed the outstanding unpaid amount of the borrowing the fund generally will need to rely on the efforts of the platforms servicers or their designated collection agencies to collect on defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans in addition the fund’s investments in shares certificates notes or other securities representing an interest in a special purpose entity organized by an alternative lending platform and the right to receive principal and interest payments due on whole loans or fractions of whole loans owned by such entity are typically unsecured obligations of the issuer as a result the fund generally may not look to the underlying loans to satisfy delinquent payments on such interests even though payments on such interests depend entirely on payments by underlying borrowers on their loans risk of inadequate collateral or guarantees on loans even if a loan in which the fund has investment exposure is secured there can be no assurance that the collateral will when recovered and liquidated generate sufficient or any funds to offset any losses associated with the defaulting loan it is possible that the same collateral could secure multiple loans in which case the liquidation proceeds of the collateral may be insufficient to cover the payments due on all the loans secured by that collateral there can be no guarantee that the collateral can be liquidated and any costs associated with such liquidation could reduce or eliminate the amount of funds otherwise available to offset the payments due under      the loan as described further under “risks of unsecured loans” the fund generally will need to rely on the efforts of the platforms servicers or their designated collection agencies to collect on defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans to the extent that the loan obligations in which the fund directly or indirectly invests are guaranteed by a third party there can be no assurance that the guarantor will perform its payment obligations should the underlying borrower default on its payments as described under “default risk” the fund could suffer delays or limitations on its ability to realize the benefits of the collateral to the extent the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent moreover the fund’s security interests may be unperfected for a variety of reasons including the failure to make a required filing by the servicer and as a result the fund may not have priority over other creditors as it expected assetbacked securities risk the fund’s investments in securitization vehicles or other special purpose entities that hold alternative lendingrelated securities assetbacked securities may involve risks that differ from or are greater than risks associated with other types of investments in addition prepayment on the underlying assets may have the effect of shortening the weighted average maturity of the portfolio assets of such entities and may lower their return the assetbacked securities in which the fund invests are also subject to risks associated with their structure and the nature of the underlying assets and the servicing of those assets for this reason many of the other risks described herein are relevant to the assetbacked securities to which the fund will have exposure there is risk that the underlying debt securities will default and that recovery on repossessed collateral might be unavailable or inadequate to support payments on the underlying investments the risks and returns for investors like the fund in assetbacked securities depend on the tranche in which the investor holds an interest many assetbacked securities in which the fund invests may be difficult to value and may be deemed illiquid assetbacked securities may have the effect of magnifying the fund’s exposure to changes in the value of the underlying assets and may also result in increased volatility in the fund’s nav this means the fund may have the potential for greater gains as well as the potential for greater losses than if the fund owned the underlying asset directly the value of an investment in the fund may be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent that the fund is exposed to assetbacked securities directly or indirectly any mishandling of related documentation by a servicer may also affect the rights of the security holders in and to the underlying collateral creditcounterparty risk the value of a debt security depends on the issuer’s credit quality or ability to pay principal and interest when due the securities in which the fund may invest may have varying degrees of credit risk and subject to the fundamental investment restrictions which among other things prohibit the fund from investing in loans of subprime quality the fund will not be restricted by any borrower credit criteria or credit risk limitation the value of a debt security is likely to fall if an issuer or the guarantor of a security is unable or unwilling or perceived to be unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or otherwise to honor its obligations or if the debt security’s rating is downgraded the obligations of issuers are subject to bankruptcy insolvency and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors the value of a debt security can also decline in response to other changes in market economic industry political and regulatory conditions that affect a particular type of debt security or issuer or debt securities generally such as conditions in the alternative lending market unlike other debt instruments that are rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the alternative lendingrelated securities in which the fund invests are typically unrated or rated only by the platform the fund will rely on the borrower’s credit information which is provided by the platforms however as described under “default risk” such information may be out of date incomplete or inaccurate and may therefore not accurately reflect the borrower’s actual creditworthiness platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information and therefore the fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the making of a particular loan      although the fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by platforms from which the fund purchases alternative lendingrelated securities the fund typically will not have access to all of the data that platforms utilize to assign credit scores to particular loans purchased directly or indirectly by the fund and will not independently diligence or confirm the truthfulness of such information or otherwise evaluate the basis for the platform’s credit score of those loans as a result the fund may make investments based on outdated inaccurate or incomplete information in addition the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that could potentially contain programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed this could adversely affect loan pricing data and approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or misclassified which could ultimately have a negative impact on the fund’s performance platform risk as discussed in more detail in “default risk” and “risk of unsecured loans” the fund receives payments on whole loans or securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on loans only if the platform servicing the loans receives the borrower’s payments on such loans and passes such payments through to the fund if a borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason the fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal or interest due as among other reasons the fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated the loan may be unsecured or undercollateralized andor it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower the fund may have limited knowledge about the underlying loans and will be dependent upon the platform for information regarding underlying loans although the fund conducts diligence on the platforms the fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information provided by the platforms other than payment information regarding loans and other alternative lendingrelated securities owned by the fund which the fund will observe directly as payments are received some investors including the fund may not review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general criteria of the investments as described above as a result the fund is dependent on the platforms’ ability to collect verify and provide information to the fund about each loan and borrower the fund will rely on the borrower’s credit information which is provided by the platforms however as described under “default risk” such information may be out of date incomplete or inaccurate and may therefore not accurately reflect the borrower’s actual creditworthiness platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information and therefore the fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the making of a particular loan although the fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by platforms from which the fund purchases alternative lendingrelated securities the fund typically will not have access to all of the data that platforms utilize to assign

the platform’s credit score of those loans as a result the fund may make investments based on outdated inaccurate or incomplete information in addition the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that could potentially contain programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed this could adversely affect loan pricing data and approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or misclassified which could ultimately have a negative impact on the fund’s performance in addition the underlying loans in some cases may be affected by the success of the platforms through which they are facilitated therefore disruptions in the businesses of such platforms may also negatively impact the value of the fund’s investments in addition disruption in the business of a platform could limit or eliminate the      ability of the fund to invest in loans originated by that platform and therefore the fund could lose some or all of the benefit of its diligence effort with respect to that platform the fund may also invest directly or indirectly in public or private equity securities of alternative lending platforms or enter into other financial transactions including derivative transactions to gain exposure to such investments the performance of equity instruments issued by a platform or derivatives thereon will depend on the success of the platform’s business and operations as described above the fund may also invest in shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans platforms are forprofit businesses that as a general matter generate revenue by collecting fees on funded loans from borrowers and by assessing a loan servicing fee on investors which may be a fixed annual amount or a percentage of the loan or amounts collected this business could be disrupted in multiple ways for example a platform could file for bankruptcy or a platform might suffer reputational harm from negative publicity about the platform or alternative lending more generally and the loss of investor confidence in the event that a loan facilitated through the platform is not repaid and the investor loses money on its investment many platforms andor their affiliates have incurred operating losses since their inception and may continue to incur net losses in the future particularly as their businesses grow and they incur additional operating expenses the fund’s investments could be adversely impacted if a platform that services the fund’s investments becomes unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations to do so in order to mitigate this risk the fund would seek to rely on a backup servicer provided through the platform or through an unaffiliated backup servicer to the extent that it is not possible to collect on defaulted loans or to the extent borrowers prepay loans a platform that services loans may no longer be able to collect a servicing fee which would negatively impact its business operations these or other similar negative events could adversely affect the platforms’ businesses andor investor participation in a platform’s marketplace and in turn the business of the platforms which creates a risk of loss for the fund’s investments in securities issued by a platform or derivatives thereon platforms may have a higher risk profile than companies engaged in lines of business with a longer more established operating history and such investments should be viewed as longerterm investments they have met with and will continue to meet with challenges including navigating evolving regulatory and competitive environments increasing the number of borrowers and investors utilizing their marketplace increasing the volume of loans facilitated through their marketplace and transaction fees received for matching borrowers and investors through their marketplace entering into new markets and introducing new loan products continuing to revise the marketplace’s proprietary credit decisions and scoring models continuing to develop maintain and scale their platforms effectively maintaining and scaling financial and risk management controls and procedures maintaining the security of the platform and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across the platform and attracting integrating and retaining an appropriate number of qualified employees if platforms are not successful in addressing these issues the platforms’ businesses and their results of operations may be harmed which may reduce the possible available investments for the fund or negatively impact the value of the fund’s investments in platforms or in alternative lendingrelated securities more generally platforms may rely on debt facilities and other forms of borrowing in order to finance many of the borrower loans they facilitate however these financing sources may become unavailable after their current maturity dates or the terms may become less favorable to the borrowing platforms as the volume of loans that a platform facilitates increases the platform may need to expand its borrowing capacity on its existing debt arrangements or may need to seek new sources of capital platforms may also default on or breach their existing debt agreements which could diminish or eliminate their access to funding at all or on terms acceptable to the platforms such events could cause the fund to incur losses on its investments that are dependent upon the performance of the platforms      the fund’s investments in the equity securities of platforms including common stock preferred stock warrants or convertible stock are subject to equity securities risk equity securities risk is the risk that the value of equity securities to which the fund is exposed will fall due to general market or economic conditions overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic instability currency interest rate and commodity price fluctuations perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers participate and the particular circumstances and performance of the issuers the prices of equities are also sensitive to rising interest rates as the costs of capital rise and borrowing costs increase the equity securities of smaller less seasoned companies such as platforms or their affiliates are generally subject to greater price fluctuations limited liquidity higher transaction costs and higher investment risk to the extent that the fund invests in unlisted equity securities the investments generally will involve a higher degree of valuation and performance uncertainty and greater liquidity risk than investments in listed securities preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities in addition preferred securities generally pay a dividend and rank ahead of common stocks and behind debt securities in claims for dividends and for assets of the issuer in a liquidation or bankruptcy for this reason the value of preferred securities will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial condition or prospects preferred securities may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates when interest rates rise the fixed dividend on preferred securities may be less attractive causing the price of preferred stocks to decline convertible securities are subject to the risks applicable generally to debt securities including credit risk convertible securities also react to changes in the value of the common stock into which they convert and are thus subject to market risk in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities typically would be paid before the company’s common stockholders but after holders of any senior debt obligations of the company the fund’s investments in shares certificates notes or other securities issued by a platform its affiliates or a special purpose entity sponsored by a platform or its affiliates that represent the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans may expose the fund to the credit risk of the issuer generally such securities are unsecured obligations of the issuer an issuer that becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings may be unable to make full and timely payments on its obligations to the fund even if the payments on the underlying loan or loans continue to be made timely and in full in addition when the fund owns such fractional loans or other securities the fund and its custodian generally will not have a contractual relationship with or personally identifiable information regarding individual borrowers so the fund will not be able to enforce underlying loans directly against borrowers and may not be able to appoint an alternative servicing agent in the event that a platform or thirdparty servicer as applicable ceases to service the underlying loans therefore the fund will be more dependent on the platform for servicing than in the case in which the fund owns whole loans where such interests are secured the fund relies on the platform to perfect the fund’s security interest in addition there may be a delay between the time the fund commits to purchase a security issued by a platform its affiliate or a special purpose entity sponsored by the platform or its affiliate and the issuance of such security and during such delay the funds committed to such an investment will not earn interest on the investment nor will they be available for investment in other alternative lendingrelated securities which will reduce the effective rate of return on the investment the fund will invest primarily in whole loans and does not expect to invest a material portion of its portfolio in such fractional loans or other securities servicer risk the fund expects that all of its direct and indirect investments in loans originated by alternative lending platforms will be serviced by a platform or a thirdparty servicer in the event that the servicer is unable to service the loan there can be no guarantee that a backup servicer will be able to assume responsibility for servicing the loans in a timely or costeffective manner any resulting disruption or delay could jeopardize payments due to the fund in respect of its investments or increase the costs associated with the fund’s investments if the servicer becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding there is some risk that the fund’s investments could be recharacterized as a secured loan from the fund to the platform as described more      fully with respect to the potential bankruptcy of a platform under “regulatory risk” which could result in uncertainty costs and delays from having the fund’s investment deemed part of the bankruptcy estate of the platform rather than an asset owned outright by the fund regulatory risk the loan industry is highly regulated and the alternative lendingrelated securities in which the fund invests are subject to extensive rules and regulations issued by governmental authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which the fund invests these authorities also may impose obligations and restrictions on the platforms’ activities or those of other entities involved in the alternative lending process the platforms’ failure to comply with the requirements of applicable law may cause among other things the platforms to be required to register with governmental authorities andor the revocation of requisite licenses the voiding of loan contracts impairment of the enforcement of loans indemnification liability to contract counterparties class action lawsuits administrative enforcement actions andor civil and criminal liability in the relevant jurisdiction the evolving nature of the platforms’ respective business models may complicate their ability to determine the applicability of and to effect compliance with such requirements moreover legal and regulatory requirements and any interpretations of those requirements are subject to periodic changes any such change necessitating new significant compliance obligations could have an adverse effect on the platforms’ compliance costs and ability to operate the platforms could seek to pass through any increase in their costs to their borrowers or investors such as the fund in the form of higher origination or servicing fees in connection with the sale and servicing of the whole loans fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans the platforms typically make representations and warranties to investors such as the fund that the loans were originated and are being serviced in accordance with and in compliance with applicable laws and in some cases specifically with the laws described herein in all material respects despite these representations and warranties the fund cannot guarantee that the platforms have been and will continue to be in compliance with all applicable laws if those representations and warranties were not correct the platforms could be required to repurchase the loans but the fund cannot be certain that the platform would be required and able to repurchase loans in all such cases in addition to laws governing the activities of lenders and servicers a limited number of states require purchasers of certain loans primarily consumer loans to be licensed or registered in order to own the loans or in certain states to collect a rate of interest above a specified rate the fund intends to obtain licenses where required in order to pursue its investment strategy lender liability a number of judicial decisions have upheld judgments of borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith commercial reasonableness and fair dealing or a similar duty owed to the borrower or has assumed an excessive degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders if a loan held directly or indirectly by the fund were found to have been made or serviced under circumstances that give rise to lender liability the borrower’s obligation to repay that loan could be reduced or eliminated or the fund’s recovery on that loan could be otherwise impaired which would adversely impact the value of that loan in limited cases courts have subordinated the loans of a senior lender to a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower when the senior lender or its agents such as a loan servicer is found to have engaged in unfair inequitable or fraudulent conduct with respect to the other creditors if a loan held directly or indirectly by the      fund were subject to such subordination it would be junior in right of payment to other indebtedness of the borrower which could adversely impact the value of that loan privacy and data security laws while the fund will adopt policies and procedures regarding the platforms’ and custodian’s protection and use of nonpublic personal information the fund cannot guarantee the security of that data and cannot guarantee that service providers have been and will continue to comply with the us federal grammleachbliley act “glba” other data security and privacy laws and any other related regulatory requirements violations of glba and other laws could subject the fund to litigation andor fines penalties or other regulatory action which individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on the fund the fund may also face regulations related to privacy and data security in the other jurisdictions in which the fund invests leverage risk the fund or a subsidiary of the fund may obtain financing to make investments in alternative lendingrelated securities and may obtain leverage through derivative instruments or assetbacked securities that afford the fund economic leverage leverage magnifies the fund’s exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying reference assets or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have and may be considered a speculative technique the value of an investment in the fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments that have embedded leverage securitization risk in connection with the sale or contribution by the fund or its subsidiaries of certain of their alternative lendingrelated investments to any special purpose entity formed for the purpose of acquiring alternative lendingrelated investments and issuing securities the fund or its subsidiaries may be required to make certain representations about the alternative lendingrelated investments sold or contributed to such special purpose entity the fund or its subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify such special purpose entity or to repurchase the alternative lendingrelated investments to which such representations relate to the extent that any of such representation is found to have been inaccurate on the date that it was made risk of fraud the fund may be subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with the various parties involved in alternative lending including the platforms banks borrowers and third parties handling borrower and investor information prospective borrowers may materially misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms including their credit history the existence or value of purported collateral the purpose of the loan their occupation or their employment status platforms may not verify all of the information provided by prospective borrowers except where a platform is required to repurchase loans or indemnify investors fraud may adversely affect the fund’s ability to receive the principal and interest payments that it expects to receive on its investments and therefore may negatively impact the fund’s performance a platform may have the exclusive right and ability to investigate claims of borrower identity theft which creates a conflict of interest as platforms may be obligated to repurchase loans andor indemnify investors in the loans in the case of fraud and may therefore have an incentive to deny or fail to investigate properly a claim of fraud furthermore there can be no guarantee that the resources technologies or fraud prevention measures implemented by a platform will be sufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud the fund is also subject to the risk of fraudulent activity by a platform or a backup servicer in the event that a platform or backup servicer engages in fraudulent activity the pools of loans originated by the platform or any      loans serviced by the platform or backup servicer may be impaired or may not be of the quality that the fund anticipated thereby increasing the risk of default in respect of such loans below investment grade securities and unrated securities risk the fund may have exposure without limitation to investments that are rated below investment grade or that are unrated but are judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality the alternative lendingrelated securities in which the fund invests or in the case of assetbacked securities the loans that back them typically are not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization although the fund’s fundamental investment restrictions do not permit the fund to invest in loans of subprime quality some unrated securities purchased by the fund may be of credit quality comparable to securities rated below investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization in addition the fund may invest in securities that are rated below investment grade below investment grade debt securities which are commonly called “junk bonds” are rated below bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or baa by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” or have comparable ratings by another rating organization accordingly certain of the fund’s unrated investments could constitute a highly risky and speculative investment similar to an investment in “junk bonds” below investment grade investments may be subject to greater risks than other investments including greater levels of risk related to changes in interest rates credit risk including a greater risk of default and liquidity risk there is a greater risk of loss associated with alternative lendingrelated securities investments and the ability of a borrower to make principal andor interest payments is predominantly speculative for below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the adviser to have a similar quality below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry or business conditions than highergrade investments yields on below investment grade investments will fluctuate pursuant to the fundamental investment restrictions the fund will not invest of loans of subprime quality interest rate risk the values of the fund’s investments in incomeproducing alternative lendingrelated securities such as whole loans other debt instruments preferred securities and convertible securities change in response to interest rate changes in general the value of a debt security is likely to fall as interest rates rise this risk is generally greater for obligations with longer maturities or for debt securities that do not pay current interest debt securities with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes although to the extent the fund’s income is based on shortterm interest rates that fluctuate over short periods of time income received by the fund may decrease as a result of a decline in interest rates floating rate loans can also decrease in value if their interest rates do not rise as quickly or as much as market interest rates conversely variable rate instruments generally will not increase in value if interest rates decline when interest rates increase or for other reasons debt securities may be repaid more slowly than expected as a result the maturity of the debt instrument may be extended increasing the potential for loss interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable a wide variety of factors can cause interest rates to fluctuate eg central bank monetary policies inflation rates general economic conditions and market developments and debt securities may be particularly volatile during such periods currently certain interest rates are at or near historic lows and as a result they are likely to rise over time which may cause the value of the fund’s investments and therefore the fund’s net asset value to decrease prepayment risk in the event of a prepayment of all or a portion of the remaining unpaid principal amount of a loan to which the fund has investment exposure the fund will receive such prepayment but further interest will cease to accrue on      the prepaid portion of the loan after the date of the prepayment if the fund buys a security at a premium the premium could be lost in the event of a prepayment in periods of falling interest rates the rate of prepayments and price fluctuation tends to increase as borrowers are incentivized to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates during such periods the fund generally will be forced to reinvest the prepayment proceeds at lower rates of return than the fund expected to earn on the prepaid assets provided that the fund is able to identify suitable reinvestment opportunities which may adversely impact the fund’s performance illiquidity risk to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid investments illiquidity risk is the risk that the investments held by the fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the fund would like or at the price that the fund believes the security is currently worth alternative lendingrelated securities which typically are contractually nontransferable are not listed on any securities exchange andor are not registered under the securities act of  are illiquid furthermore an active reliable secondary market for alternative lendingrelated securities does not currently exist and there can be no assurance that an active market will develop at any given time the fund’s portfolio will be substantially illiquid the fund’s ability to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate certain assets may be impaired andor result in losses to the fund the fund may be unable to sell its investments even under circumstances when the adviser believes it would be in the best interests of the fund to do so illiquid investments may also be difficult to value and their pricing may be more volatile than more liquid investments which could adversely affect the price at which the fund is able to sell such instruments illiquidity risk also may be greater in times of financial stress the risks associated with illiquid instruments may be particularly acute in situations in which the fund’s operations require cash such as in connection with repurchase offers and could result in the fund borrowing to meet its shortterm needs or incurring losses on the sale of illiquid instruments valuation risk the fund is subject to valuation risk which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the fund invests are priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data market instability or human error the fund anticipates using a thirdparty pricing service to value the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities as market quotations generally are not available for the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities there is no assurance that the fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss because a portfolio security is sold at a discount to its established value if securities are mispriced shareholders could lose money upon redemption or could pay too much for shares purchased competition rampup and exposure risks the fund faces competition for access to platforms and alternative lendingrelated securities including from other institutional investors such competitors may have higher risk tolerance greater financial or other resources andor other advantages if the fund is inhibited from deploying capital in a timely or efficient manner it may be forced to invest in cash cash equivalents or other assets that may result in lower returns than may otherwise be available through investments in alternative lendingrelated securities the success of any given platform and therefore the success of the fund will depend among other things on a continuous demand for loans from qualified borrowers there can be no assurance that such demand will continue to exist there can be no assurances as to how long it will take the fund to invest the net proceeds of the offering and the longer the period the greater the likelihood that the fund’s performance will be adversely affected pending      deployment of the net proceeds of the offering the fund generally will invest cash held in cash deposits and cash equivalents the fund will limit the sale of its securities based on the adviser’s assessment of its ability to invest the proceeds in an effective and timely manner if the fund’s access to platforms is limited whether due to rampup termination of existing arrangements or failure to secure arrangements with other platforms its exposure to the risks of the platforms to which the fund is exposed as discussed under “platform risk” and the risks of increased exposure to a potentially more limited pool of portfolio investments may increase moreover a platform may be unable to sustain its current lending model or may change its underwriting or credit models borrower acquisition channels quality of debt collection procedures andor servicing models in ways that may make such investments unsuitable for the fund such changes may occur after the fund has already made its investments and as most of the fund’s alternative lendingrelated securities are illiquid the fund may not be able to divest itself of the instruments at all or at an advantageous time or price even if the fund is exposed to a varied pool of assets the fund’s investment focus on alternative lendingrelated securities will cause the fund to be subject to greater overall risk than if the fund’s exposures were less focused as it will be exposed to events affecting the alternative lendingrelated industry even if the fund’s investments are varied as to borrower type geographic location loan purpose or other features they may nevertheless have some similar characteristics and may therefore be subject to many of the same risks andor regulatory regimes and may respond in a similar manner to particular economic market political or other developments geographic focus risk a geographic focus in a particular region may expose the fund to an increased risk of loss due to risks associated with that region certain regions from time to time will experience weaker economic conditions than others and consequently will likely experience higher rates of delinquency and loss than on similar investments across the geographic regions to which the fund is exposed in the event that a significant portion of the alternative lendingrelated securities of the fund relate to loans owed by borrowers resident or operating in certain specific geographic regions any localized economic conditions weather events natural or manmade disasters or other factors affecting those regions in particular could increase delinquency and defaults on the assets to which the fund is exposed and could negatively impact fund performance further any focus of the fund’s alternative lendingrelated investments in one or more regions would have a disproportionate effect on the fund if governmental authorities in any such region took action against any of the participants in the alternative lending industry doing business in that region foreign securities risk the fund may invest directly or indirectly in the alternative lendingrelated securities of foreign issuers such investments may involve risks not ordinarily associated with exposure to alternative lendingrelated securities of us issuers the foreign alternative lending industry may be subject to less governmental supervision and regulation than exists in the us conversely foreign regulatory regimes applicable to the alternative lending industry may be more complex and more restrictive than those in the us resulting in higher costs associated with such investments and such regulatory regimes may be subject to interpretation or change without prior notice to investors such as the fund foreign platforms may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the us the fund’s exposure to alternative lendingrelated securities issued by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which may adversely affect the net return on such investments as described further under “currency risk” fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls may adversely affect the market value of the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities of foreign issuers the fund is unlikely to be able to pass through to its shareholders foreign income tax credits in respect of any foreign income taxes it pays      currency risk currency risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the market value of the fund’s investments currency risk includes the risk that the foreign currencies in which the fund’s investments are traded in which the fund receives income or in which the fund has taken a position will decline in value relative to the us dollar currency risk also includes the risk that a currency to which the fund has obtained exposure through hedging declines in value relative to the currency being hedged in which event the fund may realize a loss both on the hedging instrument and on the currency being hedged currency exchange rates can fluctuate significantly for many reasons derivative transactions in foreign currencies such as futures forwards options and swaps may involve leverage risk in addition to currency risk in purchasing or selling local currency to fund trades denominated in that currency the fund will be exposed to the risk that the value of the foreign currency will increase or decrease which may impact the value of the fund’s investments in foreign currencies securities denominated in foreign currencies derivatives that provide exposure to foreign currencies and the fund’s income available for distribution some countries have and may continue to adopt internal economic policies that affect their currency valuations in a manner that may be disadvantageous for us investors or us companies seeking to do business in those countries investments in other pooled investment vehicles direct or indirect investing in another pooled investment vehicle such as securitization vehicles that issue assetbacked securities exposes the fund to all of the risks of that vehicle’s investments the fund will bear its pro rata share of the expenses of any such vehicle in addition to its own expenses the values of other pooled investment vehicles are subject to change as the values of their respective component assets fluctuate to the extent the fund invests in managed pooled investment vehicles the performance of the fund’s investments in such vehicles will be dependent upon the investment and research abilities of persons other than the adviser the securities offered by such vehicles typically are not registered under the securities laws because they are offered in transactions that are exempt from registration market risk the value of the fund’s investments may decline sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to general economic conditions that are not specifically related to a particular issuer or borrower such as real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions throughout the world changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally the value of the fund’s investments also may decline because of factors that affect a particular industry or industries these risks may be particularly acute for the fund as alternative lending is a new and evolving industry volatility risk the market value of the alternative lendingrelated securities to which the fund has exposure may increase or decrease sometimes rapidly and unpredictably based upon changes in an issuer’s financial condition andor overall market and economic conditions because many of the fund’s investments may be illiquid andor below investment grade or unrated but of a similar quality debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds” the fund may be subject to increased volatility risk in addition the fund’s use of leverage will increase the volatility of the fund’s value management and operational risk the fund is subject to management risk because it relies on the adviser’s ability to achieve its investment objective the fund runs the risk that the adviser’s investment techniques will fail to produce desired results and cause the fund to incur significant losses the adviser may fail to use derivatives effectively may select investments that do not perform as anticipated by the adviser and may choose to hedge or not to hedge positions at disadvantageous times      any imperfections errors or limitations in quantitative analyses and models used by the adviser as part of its investment process could affect the fund’s performance the fund also is subject to the risk of loss as a result of other services provided by the adviser and other service providers including pricing administrative accounting tax legal custody transfer agency and other services operational risk includes the possibility of loss caused by inadequate procedures and controls human error and cyber attacks disruptions and failures affecting or by a service provider alternative lending operational and technology risk because the fund depends on electronic systems maintained by the custodian and the platforms or their affiliates to maintain records evidence ownership of the fund’s investments appropriately safeguard such investments and to service and administer alternative lendingrelated securities as applicable the fund is vulnerable to the risks associated with such electronic systems including among others power loss computer systems failures and internet telecommunications or data network failures operator negligence or improper operation by or supervision of employees physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches misappropriation and similar events computer viruses cyber attacks intentional acts of vandalism and similar events and hurricanes fires floods and other natural disasters these potential risks may cause a decrease in the amount of loans acquired by the platforms which may directly affect the fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective the potential for security breaches may also adversely affect the fund due to its reputational impact on the platforms and wider effect on the alternative lending industry as a whole derivatives risk the fund may invest directly or indirectly in a variety of derivatives including futures contracts forwards swaps and other exchangetraded and overthecounter otc derivatives contracts derivatives are financial contracts the value of which depends on or is derived from an asset or other underlying reference derivatives involve the risk that changes in their value may not move as expected relative to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset they are designed to track the fund may invest in derivatives for investment purposes and for hedging and risk management purposes see the statement of additional information for additional information of the various types and uses of derivatives in the fund’s strategy the use of derivatives involves risks that are in addition to and potentially greater than the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets in particular the fund’s use of otc derivatives exposes it to the risk that the counterparties will be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor their obligations if the counterparty defaults the fund will still have contractual remedies but may not be able to enforce them the fund may invest in derivatives with a limited number of counterparties and events affecting the creditworthiness of any of those counterparties may have a pronounced effect on the fund derivatives also present other risks described herein including market risk illiquidity risk currency risk and credit risk many derivatives in particular otc derivatives are complex and their valuation often requires modeling and judgment which increases the risk of mispricing or improper valuation the fund’s use of derivatives may not be effective or have the desired results moreover suitable derivatives will not be available in all circumstances the adviser may decide not to use derivatives to hedge or otherwise reduce the fund’s risk exposures potentially resulting in losses for the fund swap contracts and other otc derivatives are highly susceptible to illiquidity risk see “illiquidity risk” because many derivatives have a leverage component ie a notional value in excess of the assets needed to      establish andor maintain the derivative position adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying reference asset may result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself see “leverage risk” subsidiary risk by investing through its subsidiaries the fund is exposed to the risks associated with the subsidiaries’ investments subsidiaries will not be registered as investment companies under the  act and will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the  act although each subsidiary will be managed pursuant to the compliance policies and procedures of the fund applicable to it changes in the laws of the united states andor the jurisdiction in which a subsidiary is organized could result in the inability of the fund andor the subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and could adversely affect the fund short sale risk the fund may incur a loss if the market price of the asset underlying the short sale increases between the date of the short sale and the date on which the fund must replace the borrowed asset or otherwise close out the transaction and such loss may exceed the initial investment under adverse market conditions the fund may have difficulty purchasing an asset to meet its short sale delivery obligations and may have to sell portfolio assets to raise sufficient capital to fulfill its short sale obligations at a disadvantageous time entering into short sales where the fund does not own the underlying asset creates a form of investment leverage which can magnify the fund’s exposure to changes in the value of the asset because the fund may enter into short sales with respect to assets that it does not already own the loss to the fund from a short sale is theoretically unlimited as the potential increase in the market price of the asset is unlimited the amount of any gain will be decreased and the amount of any loss increased by the amount of the premium dividends interest or expenses the fund may be required to pay in connection with a short sale there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to close out a short sales position at an advantageous time or price to the extent that the fund enters into short sales for hedging purposes there can be no guarantee that the investment will be effective any lack of correlation between the assets used in the short position and the exposure the fund sought to hedge could result in losses tax risk the fund intends to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code in order to qualify for such treatment the fund must derive at least  of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income meet certain asset diversification tests at the end of each fiscal quarter and distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a ric the tax treatment of certain of the fund’s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to rics is not certain an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment if in any year the fund were to fail to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code for any reason and were not able to cure such failure the fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income nondiversification risk the fund is classified as a “nondiversified” fund under the  act accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a “diversified” fund to the extent that the fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer the fund is subject to a higher degree of risk associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a fund that invests more widely      repurchase offers risk as described under “periodic repurchase offers” below the fund is an “interval fund” and in order to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund subject to applicable law will conduct quarterly repurchase offers of the fund’s outstanding shares at nav per quarter subject to approval of the board in all cases such repurchases will be for at least  and not more than  and are currently expected to be for  of its outstanding shares at nav pursuant to rule c under the  act the fund believes that these repurchase offers are generally beneficial to the fund’s shareholders and repurchases generally will be funded from available cash or sales of portfolio securities which are substantially illiquid however repurchase offers and the need to fund repurchase obligations may affect the ability of the fund to be fully invested or force the fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets in liquid investments which may harm the fund’s investment performance moreover diminution in the size of the fund through repurchases may result in untimely sales of portfolio securities with associated imputed transaction costs which may be significant and may limit the ability of the fund to participate in new investment opportunities or to achieve its investment objective in compliance with its procedures the fund will to the extent possible hold at least  of net assets in cash or other liquid assets at all times in order to meet its repurchase obligations the fund may accumulate cash by holding back ie not reinvesting payments received in connection with the fund’s investments the fund believes that payments received in connection with the fund’s investments will generate sufficient cash to meet the maximum potential amount of the fund’s repurchase obligations if at any time cash and other liquid assets held by the fund are not sufficient to meet the fund’s repurchase obligations the fund intends if necessary to sell investments although the fund’s investments are illiquid and the secondary market for its investments is limited the fund believes that it would be able to find willing buyers for investments if such sales were ever necessary to supplement such cash generated by payments received in connection with the fund’s investments if the fund employed investment leverage repurchases of shares would compound the adverse effects of leverage in a declining market in addition if the fund borrows to finance repurchases interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares by increasing the fund’s expenses and reducing any net investment income if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed the fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request as a result shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the fund during a particular repurchase offer some shareholders in anticipation of proration may tender more shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter thereby increasing the likelihood that proration will occur a shareholder may be subject to market and other risks and the nav of shares tendered in a repurchase offer may decline between the repurchase request deadline and the date on which the nav for tendered shares is determined in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund may be a taxable event to shareholders portfolio turnover a change in the securities held by the fund is known as “portfolio turnover” if the fund realizes capital gains when it sells investments it generally must pay those gains to shareholders increasing its taxable distributions including distributions of shortterm capital gain which are taxable as ordinary income to shareholders increased portfolio turnover may also result in higher brokerage fees or other transaction costs which can reduce the fund’s performance portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities temporary defensive and interim investments for temporary defensive purposes in times of adverse or unstable market economic or political conditions the fund can invest up to  of its assets in investments that may be inconsistent with its principal investment strategies generally the fund would invest in money market instruments or in other shortterm us or nonus government securities the fund might also hold these types of securities as interim investments pending the      investment of proceeds from the sale of its shares or the sale of its portfolio securities or to meet anticipated redemptions of its shares to the extent the fund invests in these securities it might not achieve its investment objective expense risk your actual costs of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in “annual fund operating expenses” for a variety of reasons the fund’s expense limitation agreements which generally remain in effect for a period of one year mitigate this risk however there is no assurance that the adviser will renew such expense limitation agreements from yeartoyear antitakeover provisions the fund’s declaration of trust together with any amendments thereto includes provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the fund or convert the fund to openend status no prior history the fund is a newlyorganized closedend management investment company with no history of operations and is designed for longterm investors and not as a trading vehicle      fund expenses the following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund   annual fund operating expenses as a percentage of net assets attributable to the shares          management fees            interest payments on borrowed funds            service fees            other expenses      loan servicing fees                    all other expenses                               total other expenses                       total annual fund operating expenses            fee waiver andor expense reimbursementrecoupment                       total annual fund operating expenses afterfee waiverexpense reimbursementrecoupment                           amount assumes that the fund sells  billion worth of shares during the fund’s first twelve months and that the fund’s net offering proceeds from such sales equal  billion expenses are estimated actual expenses will depend on the fund’s net assets which will be affected by the number of shares the fund sells in this offering for example if the fund were to raise proceeds significantly less than this amount over the following twelve months average net assets would be significantly lower and some expenses as a percentage of net assets would be significantly higher there can be no assurance that the fund will sell  billion worth of shares during the following twelve months   “interest payments on borrowed funds” are based on estimated levels of borrowing and estimated interest rates for the current fiscal year if the fund were to incur higher levels of borrowing or pay higher interest rates interest payments on borrowed funds as a percentage of net assets would be higher   “other expenses” are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year   the fund is responsible for its operating expenses including its organization expenses which are expensed as incurred and are subject to the expense limitation agreement described below notwithstanding the foregoing through the oneyear anniversary of the date the fund commences investment operations the adviser defined below has agreed to pay or otherwise bear operating and other expenses of the fund including organizational and offering expenses but excluding brokerage and transactional expenses borrowing and other investmentrelated costs and fees including interest payments on borrowed funds loan servicing fees loan collection and administration fees and expenses interest and commitment fees short dividend expense acquired fund fees and expenses taxes litigation and indemnification expenses judgments and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the fund’s business solely to the extent necessary to limit the total annual fund operating expenses to  of the average daily net assets of the fund the adviser shall be permitted to recoup in later periods fund expenses that the adviser has paid or otherwise borne to the extent that the expenses for the fund fall below the annual limitation rate in effect at the time of the actual waiverreimbursement and to the extent that they do not cause the fund to exceed the annual rate in effect at the time of the recoupment under the expense limitation agreement the adviser is not permitted to recoup such expenses beyond three years from the end of the fiscal year in which the adviser reduced a fee or reimbursed an expense this expense limitation cannot be terminated prior to the oneyear anniversary of the date the fund commences investment operations example the following example is intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses that you as a holder of shares would bear directly or indirectly the example assumes that you invest  in shares of the fund for the time periods indicated because there are no costs to you associated with repurchases of your shares your costs would be the same whether you hold your shares or tender your shares for repurchase at the end of the time periods indicated the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year that all dividends and distributions are reinvested at nav and that the fund’s operating expenses as described above remain the same except to reduce annual expenses upon completion of organization and offering expenses and takes into account the effect of the fee waiver andor expense reimbursement if any during the    first year the example should not be considered a representation of the fund’s future expenses although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be           year         years         years         years   fund                                            financial highlights the fund is newly organized and its shares have not previously been offered therefore the fund does not have any financial history additional information about the fund’s investments will be available in the fund’s annual and semiannual reports when they are prepared the fund stone ridge alternative lending risk premium fund the “fund” is a newly organized nondiversified closedend management investment company registered under the  act the fund was organized as a delaware statutory trust on november   pursuant to a certificate of trust the fund has no operating history the fund’s principal office is located at  madison ave st floor new york city ny  use of proceeds the fund will invest the proceeds of the offering of shares in accordance with its investment objective and policies as stated below it is currently anticipated that the fund will be able to invest all or substantially all of the net proceeds according to its investment objective and policies within approximately one month after receipt of the proceeds depending on the amount and timing of proceeds available to the fund as well as the availability of investments consistent with the fund’s investment objective and strategies pending investment of the net proceeds the fund will invest in highquality shortterm debt securities cash andor cash equivalents investment objective policies and risks when used in this prospectus the term “invest” includes both direct investing and indirect investing and the term “investments” includes both direct investments and indirect investments for example the fund may invest indirectly by investing in derivatives or through one or more whollyowned and controlled subsidiaries each a “subsidiary” the fund may be exposed to the different types of investments described below through its investments in its subsidiaries the allocation of the fund’s portfolio in a subsidiary will vary over time and might not always include all of the different types of investments described herein investment objective the fund’s investment objective is to achieve total return and current income there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective policies stone ridge asset management llc “stone ridge” or the “adviser” believes that investing should involve a longterm view and a systematic focus on sources of expected return not on security selection or market timing in managing the fund the adviser focuses primarily on one source of expected returns the “credit risk premium” in certain loans and other investments described below the “credit risk premium” is positive if interest payments paid in connection with a pool of such investments minus the principal losses actually experienced across that pool exceed the risk free rate on average and over time the “riskfree rate” is the rate of return that can be earned on highquality shortterm government debt securities there can be no assurance that the credit risk premium will be positive for the fund’s investments at any time or on average and over time for example a consumer or small business borrower typically pays a premium interest to a lender in exchange for use of the lender’s capital the amount of the borrowing for a predetermined amount of time on average and over time if payments of interest and repayments of principal on such borrowings are greater than losses incurred from defaults the excess positive return represents the credit premium by investing in these loans and other investments the fund is accepting the risk that some borrowers will not repay their loans in exchange for the expected returns associated with the receipt of interest payments and repayment of principal by those that do the fund seeks to benefit over the longterm from the difference between the amount of interest and principal received and losses experienced    the adviser will not purchase or sell investments for the fund’s portfolio based on an analysis of specific borrowers’ abilities to repay their loans or other criteria specific to individual securities instead the adviser seeks to identify alternative lending platforms that originate pools of loans and other securities on an ongoing basis that can be purchased by the fund and serve as part of a portfolio that will provide the fund with broad exposure to the risk and return characteristics and potential credit risk premium of loans from a variety of geographic regions and representing a variety of different borrower types for a variety of loan purposes including but not limited to     •   individual consumers consolidating existing debt or funding large purchases     •   small or mediumsized businesses funding working capital such as property plant equipment expansion receivables or inventory     •   students financing education or refinancing existing student loans the fund has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies that can only be changed with the approval of the holders of a majority of the fund’s outstanding voting securities the “fundamental investment restrictions”     •   the fund may not invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment     •   the fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities from platforms whose business consists primarily of originating loans of subprime quality     •   the fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities originated in emerging markets     •   the fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities from platforms whose financial statements are not audited by a nationally recognized accounting firm the adviser as part of its portfolio construction process performs diligence on the platforms from which the fund purchases alternative lendingrelated securities in order to evaluate both the process by which each platform extends loans to borrowers and provides related services and the characteristics of the overall portfolio of loans made available through that platform the adviser’s diligence process includes onsite inperson meetings supplemented by telephonic meetings with the senior management and with the credit underwriting operations technology legal and compliance teams of the platform evaluation of the platform’s credit underwriting policies procedures and models evaluation of the platform’s collections operations technology legal and compliance personnel infrastructure and procedures and analysis of a “loan tape” that includes loan underwriting data and actual payment experience for all individual loans made by the platform since inception that are comparable to the loans proposed to be purchased by the fund the fund generally purchases a portfolio of loans from a particular platform that meet certain criteria such as maturities and durations borrower and loan types borrower credit quality and geographic locations of borrower and that provide broad exposure to that particular platform’s loan originations the fund will invest solely in loans originated by platforms that will provide the fund with a written commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered individual loanlevel data on an ongoing basis throughout the life of each individual loan that is updated periodically as often as the nav is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or loan and the fund will not invest in loans sold on platforms for which the fund cannot evaluate to its satisfaction the completeness and accuracy of the individual loan data relevant to the existence and valuation of the loans purchased that is provided by the platform and used by the fund in accounting for loans although the fund conducts diligence on the platforms the fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information provided by the platforms other than payment information regarding loans and other alternative lendingrelated securities owned by the fund which the fund will observe directly as payments are received the fund generally will not have access to personally identifiable information about the individual borrowers eg names or similar identifying information prior to purchasing loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities although the fund’s custodian will have this information for whole loans owned by the fund and the fund and the adviser have    established procedures with the fund’s custodian designed to prevent the inadvertent communication of personally identifiable borrower information by the fund’s custodian to the fund or the adviser the fund will monitor the characteristics of the alternative lendingrelated securities purchased from particular platforms on an ongoing basis in this way the adviser seeks to construct a portfolio that provides broad representative investment exposure across the alternative lending asset class the fund may invest more than  of its total assets in loans originated by funding circle limited an alternative lending platform operating in the united states the united kingdom and continental europe that makes small business loans lendingclub corporation an alternative lending platform operating in the united states that makes consumer loans or sofi lending corp an alternative lending platform operating in the united states that makes consumer loans however there can be no assurance that the fund will invest more than  of its total assets in loans originated by any of these platforms and if the fund invests more than  of its total assets in loans originated by any of these platforms at any time there can be no assurance that the fund will remain invested in loans originated by that platform in the future the adviser will determine whether loans offered to the fund are of subprime quality at the time of investment pursuant to guidelines approved by the board from time to time these guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the fund the adviser must determine that loans have a likelihood of repayment that is greater than that of “subprime” consumer loans “subprime” does not have a specific legal or market definition but is understood in the credit marketplace to signify that a loan has a material likelihood that it will not be repaid the adviser will make the determination that loans purchased by the fund are not of subprime quality based on the adviser’s due diligence of the credit underwriting policies of the originating platform which look to a number of borrowerspecific factors to determine a borrower’s ability to repay a particular loan including employments status income assets education and credit bureau data where available although credit bureau data is only one factor considered in determining the credit quality of a borrower and a loan when fico data is available with respect to a borrower the adviser’s guidelines do not allow the adviser to cause the fund to purchase any consumer loan to an individual whose fico score is below  at the time of origination principal investment policies the fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in alternative lendingrelated securities either directly or through one or more whollyowned and controlled subsidiaries each a “subsidiary” formed by the fund these securities typically provide the fund with exposure to loans originated by alternative lending platforms the fund will invest primarily in whole loans but also may invest to a lesser extent in other types of alternative lendingrelated securities which include     •   shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans including “memberdependent payment notes” issued by some public us platforms which we refer to as “fractional loans” herein     •   securities issued by special purpose entities that hold either of the foregoing types of alternative lendingrelated securities “assetbacked securities”     •   equity or debt securities publicly or privately offered including warrants of alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms     •   derivative instruments which may include options swaps or other derivatives that provide exposure to any of the investments the fund may make directly the fund may gain exposure directly or indirectly to loans that are unsecured secured by a perfected security interest in an enterprise or specific assets of an enterprise or individual borrower andor supported by a personal guarantee by individuals related to the borrower the loans to which the fund will gain exposure may pay fixed or variable rates of interest may have a variety of amortization schedules may include borrowings that do not require amortization payments ie are interestonly and may have a term ranging from less than one year to    thirty years or longer this universe of investments is subject to change under varying market conditions and as alternative lendingrelated instruments and markets evolve over time under normal circumstances the fund will invest at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes directly or indirectly in alternative lendingrelated securities as a matter of fundamental policy the fund will concentrate its investments in the alternative lending industry the fund may seek to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risks that arise as a result of its investments the fund may use forwards futures swaps or other listed or overthecounter “otc” derivatives or may purchase or sell physical currency bonds or other securities including short sales on assets the fund does not own which may require the fund to pay a premium to borrow the assets sold short and to pay the lender any dividends or interest received on the assets while borrowed there can be no guarantee the fund’s hedging activities will effectively offset any adverse impact of foreign exchange or interest rates in implementing the fund’s investment strategy the adviser has broad discretion to invest in alternative lendingrelated securities of different types and relating to a variety of borrower types and geographic regions including regions inside and outside the us subject to the fundamental investment restrictions which prohibit the fund from investing in loans of subprime quality or loans originated in emerging markets initially the adviser expects to seek to invest in alternative lendingrelated securities through platforms that operate in and that originate loans to borrowers located in the us europe australia and new zealand and may in the future seek to gain exposure to other geographic regions other than emerging markets within each region and borrower type the adviser has broad discretion to invest in securities that provide the fund with a variety of exposures including to borrower creditworthiness lines of business and loan purpose subject to any restrictions under applicable law including diversification requirements under us federal income tax law applicable to regulated investment companies the fund is not restricted in its exposure to any particular borrower creditworthiness line of business loan purpose term or form of security or guarantee or any other loan terms or characteristics except as provided in the fundamental investment restrictions there is no stated limit on the percentage of assets the fund can invest in a particular investment or the percentage of assets the fund will allocate to any one loan type borrower type loan purpose geographic region borrower creditworthiness term or form of security or guarantee permitted by the fundamental investment restrictions the fund may at times focus its investments in instruments meeting one or more of these criteria the fund intends to concentrate its investments in the alternative lending industry and as a matter of fundamental policy the fund will invest directly or indirectly at least  of its total assets in the alternative lending industry the fund may make investments in alternative lendingrelated securities directly or indirectly through one or more subsidiaries each subsidiary may invest for example in whole loans or in shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans or any other security that the fund may hold directly references herein to the fund include references to a subsidiary in respect of the fund’s exposure to alternative lendingrelated securities in addition the fund may directly or indirectly invest in andor sell certain of its alternative lendingrelated investments to special purpose entities formed by third parties for the purpose of acquiring alternative lendingrelated investments and issuing securities the payments on which are funded by payments received on such entities’ underlying investments such assetbacked securities may be issued in different tranches of debt and equity interests with different rights and preferences the fund may hold any tranche of such assetbacked securities there is generally a limited secondary market available for many of the securities in which the fund will invest and as a result the fund generally will hold investments to maturity as described below the fund may sell certain of its investments to securitization vehicles and to the extent a more active secondary market develops over time the fund may selectively purchase or sell loans in executing its investment strategy leverage the fund may obtain leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective the fund or a subsidiary of the fund may obtain financing to make investments in alternative lendingrelated securities the fund expects that    borrowings by the fund or a fund’s subsidiary will be secured by alternative lendingrelated securities held by the fund or such subsidiary the fund may also obtain leverage through derivative instruments that afford the fund economic leverage or other investments such as assetbacked securities that may have embedded leverage the fund is not limited in the form or manner in which it may incur leverage the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” requires a closedend fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than  of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness as defined in the  act this means that the value of the fund’s senior securities representing indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including such senior securities measured at the time the fund issues the senior securities investments or trading practices that involve contractual obligations to pay in the future are subject to the same requirements unless the fund designates liquid assets in an amount the fund believes to be equal to the fund’s contractual obligations markedtomarket on a daily basis or appropriately “covers” such obligations with offsetting positions leverage can have the effect of magnifying the fund’s exposure to changes in the value of its assets and may also result in increased volatility in the fund’s nav this means the fund will have the potential for greater gains as well as the potential for greater losses than if the fund owned its assets on an unleveraged basis the value of an investment in the fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent that the fund is exposed to leverage directly or indirectly alternative lending alternative lending which is sometimes referred to as peertopeer lending online lending or marketplace lending is a method of financing in which an alternative lending platform facilitates the borrowing and lending of money while generally not relying on deposits for capital to fund loans it is considered an alternative to more traditional debt financing done through a bank there are several different models of alternative lending but very generally a platform typically matches consumers small or mediumsized businesses or other types of borrowers with investors that are interested in gaining investment exposure to the loans made to such borrowers prospective borrowers are usually required to provide or give access to certain financial information to the platform such as the intended purpose of the loan income employment information credit score debttoincome ratio credit history including defaults and delinquencies and home ownership status and in the case of small business loans business financial statements and personal credit information regarding any guarantor some of which information is made available to prospective lenders often platforms charge fees to borrowers to cover these screening and administrative costs based on this and other relevant supplemental information the platform usually assigns its own credit rating to the borrower and sets the interest rate for the requested borrowing platforms then post the borrowing requests online and investors may choose among the loans based on the interest rates the loans are expected to yield less any servicing or origination fees charged by the platform or others involved in the lending arrangement the background data provided on the borrowers and the credit rating assigned by the platform in some cases a platform partners with a bank to originate a loan to a borrower after which the bank sells the loan to the platform alternatively some platforms may originate loans themselves some investors including the fund may not review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general criteria of the investments as described above as a result the fund is dependent on the platforms’ ability to collect verify and provide information to the fund about each loan and borrower platforms may set minimum eligibility standards for borrowers to participate in alternative lending arrangements and may limit the maximum permitted borrowings depending on the purpose and nature of the loan its term may for example be as short as six months or shorter or as long as thirty years or longer set forth below is additional information about some of the fund’s alternative lendingrelated investments whole loans the fund will invest primarily in whole loans when the fund invests directly or indirectly in whole loans it will typically purchase all rights title and interest in the loans pursuant to a loan purchase agreement directly from the platform or its affiliate the platform or a thirdparty servicer typically continues to    service the loans collecting payments and distributing them to investors less any servicing fees assessed against the fund and the servicing entity typically will make all decisions regarding acceleration or enforcement of the loans following any default by a borrower the fund expects to have a backup servicer in case any platform or affiliate of the platform ceases or fails to perform these servicing functions the fund as an investor in a whole loan would be entitled to receive payment only from the borrower andor any guarantor and would not be able to recover any deficiency from the platform except under very narrow circumstances which may include fraud by the borrower in some cases as described above the whole loans in which the fund may invest may be secured or unsecured shares certificates notes or other securities the fund may also invest directly or indirectly in shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans the platform or a separate special purpose entity organized by or on behalf of the platform may hold the whole loans underlying such securities on its books and issue to the fund as an investor a share certificate note or other security the payments on which track and depend upon the borrower payments on the underlying loans as with whole loans the platforms or thirdparty servicers typically continue to service the underlying loans on which the performance of such securities is based such securities may be linked to any of the types of whole loans in which the fund may invest directly such securities may also track fractions of a whole loan these securities may be sold through publicly registered offerings or through unregistered private offerings equity securities the fund may invest directly or indirectly in public or private equity securities issued by alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms including common stock preferred stock convertible stock andor warrants for example the fund may invest in securities issued by a platform which may provide the platform with the capital it requires to support its business equity investments may afford the fund voting rights as well as the opportunity to receive dividends andor capital appreciation although warrants which are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time typically have no voting rights receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the securities of the issuer unless and until they are exercised for the underlying equity securities the fund may also invest directly or indirectly in equity securities of both foreign and us small and midcap companies these equity investments may take any of the following forms     •   common stock holders of common stock generally have voting rights in the issuer and are entitled to receive common stock dividends when as and if declared by the corporation’s board of directors common stock normally occupies the most subordinated position in an issuer’s capital structure     •   preferred stocks preferred stock unlike common stock has a stated dividend rate payable from the corporation’s earnings preferred stock dividends may be cumulative or noncumulative participating or auction rate “cumulative” dividend provisions require all or a portion of prior unpaid dividends to be paid preferred stock may be “participating” stock which means that it may be entitled to a dividend exceeding the stated dividend in certain cases preferred stock may have mandatory sinking fund provisions as well as provisions allowing calls or redemption prior to maturity which also can have a negative impact on prices when interest rates decline     •   rights and warrants warrants are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time their values do not necessarily move parallel to the values of the underlying securities rights are similar to warrants but normally have a short duration and are distributed directly by the issuer to its shareholders rights and warrants have no voting rights receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the issuer     •   convertible securities convertible securities are debt securities or preferred stock that may be converted in whole or in part into common stock or other equity securities their prices do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of the underlying securities convertible securities generally have no voting rights the value of a convertible security is a function of its “bond value” which is the value of the debt or preferred stock component of the security and its “conversion value” which is the value of the right to convert the securities into common stock or other equity securities the bond value      will likely increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise and the conversion value will likely increase when the value of the underlying equity security increases and decrease when the value of the underlying equity security decreases if the bond value is relatively high compared to the conversion value the security will behave more like a debt security and if the conversion value is relatively high compared to the bond value the security will behave more like an equity security other factors can affect a particular equity security’s price such as poor earnings reports by the issuer loss of major customers major litigation against the issuer or changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its industry debt securities the fund may invest directly or indirectly in debt securities issued by alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms the fund may have exposure to the debt securities of us or foreign issuers these debt securities may have fixed or floating interest rates may or may not be collateralized and may be below investment grade or unrated but judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds” the fund has no limits as to the maturity of debt securities in which it invests directly or indirectly such investments may be within any maturity range short medium or long depending on the adviser’s evaluation of investment opportunities available within the debt securities market similarly the fund has no limits as to the market capitalization range of the issuers assetbacked securities the fund may invest in securitization vehicles that issue assetbacked securities which are debt securities backed by or residual equity interests in pools of alternative lendingrelated debt securities such a securitization vehicle may be formed by a platform a pooled investment vehicle or any other entity changes to the fund’s investment policies the fund’s investment objective and policies may be changed without shareholder approval unless an objective or policy is identified in the prospectus or in the statement of additional information as “fundamental” the fund’s policy to invest under normal circumstances at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in alternative lendingrelated securities may be changed by the board upon at least  days prior written notice to shareholders temporary defensive positions during unusual market conditions the fund may invest up to  of its assets in cash or cash equivalents temporarily which may be inconsistent with its investment objective and other policies the fund might not use all of the strategies and techniques or invest in all of the types of securities described in this prospectus or the statement of additional information while at times the fund may use alternative investment strategies in an effort to limit its losses it may choose not to do so subsidiaries the fund may execute its strategy by investing directly or through one or more subsidiaries in alternative lendingrelated securities the fund does not currently intend to sell or transfer all or any portion of its ownership interest in a subsidiary the fund reserves the right to establish additional subsidiaries through which the fund may execute its strategy risk considerations investors should carefully consider the fund’s risks and investment objective as an investment in the fund may not be appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program an investment in the fund involves a high degree of risk it is possible that investing in the fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested before making an investmentallocation decision investors should i consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investor’s or a client’s investment objectives    and individual situation and ii consider factors such as an investor’s or a client’s net worth income age and risk tolerance investment should be avoided where an investorclient has a shortterm investing horizon andor cannot bear the loss of some or all of the investment the fund is subject to the principal risks noted below whether through the fund’s direct investments investments through a subsidiary or derivatives positions as with any investment company there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment objective you could lose all or part of your investment in the fund and the fund could underperform other investments default risk the value of the fund’s investments in whole loans and other alternative lendingrelated securities such as shares certificates notes or other securities representing an interest in and the right to receive principal and interest payments due on whole loans or fractions of whole loans is entirely dependent on the borrowers’ continued and timely payments the fund receives payments on such investments only if the party servicing the loans receives the borrower’s payments on the corresponding or underlying loan and passes such payments through to the fund if a borrower fails to make interest payments or repay principal when due on a loan in which the fund has investment exposure or if the value of such a loan decreases the value of the fund’s investments will be adversely affected there can be no assurance that payments due on underlying loans will be made if a borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason the fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal or interest due as among other reasons the fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated the loan may be unsecured or undercollateralized andor it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower if the fund were unable to recover unpaid principal or interest due this would cause the fund’s net asset value to decrease as described further under “risks of unsecured loans” the fund generally will not be able to offset losses on defaulting loans by looking to collateral or obligations of guarantors insurers or governmental authorities as many of the loans to which the fund will have exposure are obligations not secured by collateral or except for certain loans to businesses backed by any guarantee in certain cases after the loan has matured the servicing party may have no obligation to make late payments to investors in such loan and to the extent that the servicing party receives any funds from defaulting borrowers the servicing party may retain those funds to cover attorneys’ fees collection fees or other costs incurred in pursuing collection which will diminish or eliminate the amount that the servicing party would otherwise pass on to the investor borrowings obtained through alternative lending platforms may not limit borrowers from incurring additional debt if a borrower incurs additional debt obligations after obtaining a loan through an alternative lending platform the borrower’s creditworthiness may diminish and any additional obligations could cause the borrower to experience financial distress insolvency or bankruptcy all of which would impair the borrower’s ability to repay the loan underlying the fund’s investment under certain circumstances payments to the fund may be reclaimed in a bankruptcy proceeding if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance or a preferential payment which will result in losses to the fund if the additional debt obligation of the borrower is secured by collateral and the borrowing through the alternative lending platform is unsecured the borrower may be motivated to repay the secured loan before meeting its obligations under the unsecured loan furthermore the ability of secured creditors to pursue remedies against the collateral of the borrower may impair the borrower’s ability to repay its unsecured loan or it may impair the platform’s or loan servicer’s ability to collect on the loan upon default the loans in which the fund invests generally will not include any crossdefault provisions crossdefault provisions render a default on one outstanding debt obligation an automatic default on another debt obligation of the borrower which permits creditors to react more quickly to take steps to protect their interests in contrast the loans in which the fund will invest typically will be placed in default or referred to collection only if there are independent defaults on such loans irrespective of whether the borrower has defaulted    on a different debt obligation not only will the fund not benefit from such protective provisions the fund also generally will not be made aware of any additional debt incurred by a borrower or whether such debt is secured or unsecured default rates on loans obtained through alternative lending platforms may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside the fund’s control such as economic downturns or general economic or political conditions including prevailing interest rates the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence residential real estate values the value of the various currencies energy prices changes in consumer spending the number of personal bankruptcies insolvencies disruptions in the credit markets the borrower’s personal circumstances and other factors the default history for alternative lending borrowing arrangements is limited future defaults may be higher than historical defaults and the timing of defaults may vary significantly from historical observations as described further under “creditcounterparty risk” the credit profile and interest rates available to certain borrowers who seek credit through alternative lending platforms may result in a higher rate of default for alternative lendingrelated securities as compared with the debt instruments associated with more traditional lending models such as banks although pursuant to the fundamental investment restrictions the fund will not invest in loans of subprime quality if the impact of defaults on loans to which the fund has exposure exceeds the profits on nondefaulting loans the fund will be unable to achieve its investment objective the fund’s investments in equity securities issued by the platforms themselves or their affiliates are also subject to the risk of loss if a platform defaults on its outstanding obligations the fund’s equity interest in the platform may be diminished or extinguished and the fund can expect to realize on any such investments only to the extent that the platform’s creditors are made whole and the platform still has residual profits that would benefit equity holders risk of unsecured loans many of the fund’s investments are associated with loans that are unsecured obligations of borrowers this means that they are not secured by any collateral not insured by any third party not backed by any governmental authority in any way and except in the case of certain loans to businesses not guaranteed by any third party when a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan the holder’s only recourse is generally to accelerate the loan and enter into litigation to recover the outstanding principal and interest there is no assurance that such litigation would result in full repayment of the loan and the costs of such measures may frequently exceed the outstanding unpaid amount of the borrowing the fund generally will need to rely on the efforts of the platforms servicers or their designated collection agencies to collect on defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans the fund typically will not know the identity of borrowers and will contract with the platforms or thirdparty loan servicers to service the loans and therefore does not expect to and in many cases will have no way to pursue borrowers that fail to repay principal or interest in addition the fund’s investments in shares certificates notes or other securities representing an interest in a special purpose entity organized by an alternative lending platform and the right to receive principal and interest payments due on whole loans or fractions of whole loans owned by such entity are typically unsecured obligations of the issuer as a result the fund generally may not look to the underlying loans to satisfy delinquent payments on such interests even though payments on such interests depend entirely on payments by underlying borrowers on their loans risk of inadequate collateral or guarantees on loans even if a loan in which the fund has investment exposure is secured there can be no assurance that the collateral will when recovered and liquidated generate sufficient or any funds to offset any losses associated with the defaulting loan it is possible that the same collateral could secure multiple loans in which case the liquidation proceeds of the collateral may be insufficient to cover the payments due on all the loans secured by that collateral there can be no guarantee that the collateral can be liquidated and any costs associated with such    liquidation could reduce or eliminate the amount of funds otherwise available to offset the payments due under the loan as described further under “risks of unsecured loans” the fund generally will need to rely on the efforts of the platforms servicers or their designated collection agencies to collect on defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans to the extent that the loan obligations in which the fund directly or indirectly invests are guaranteed by a third party there can be no assurance that the guarantor will perform its payment obligations should the underlying borrower default on its payments as described under “default risk” the fund could suffer delays or limitations on its ability to realize the benefits of the collateral to the extent the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent moreover the fund’s security interests may be unperfected for a variety of reasons including the failure to make a required filing by the servicer and as a result the fund may not have priority over other creditors as it expected assetbacked securities risk the fund’s investments in securitization vehicles or other special purpose entities that hold alternative lendingrelated securities assetbacked securities may involve risks that differ from or are greater than risks associated with other types of investments for example such assetbacked securities may be more sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates than other securities in addition prepayment on the underlying assets may have the effect of shortening the weighted average maturity of the portfolio assets of such entities and may lower their return the assetbacked securities in which the fund invests are also subject to risks associated with their structure and the nature of the underlying assets and the servicing of those assets for this reason many of the other risks described herein are relevant to the assetbacked securities to which the fund will have exposure there is risk that the underlying debt securities will default and that recovery on repossessed collateral might be unavailable or inadequate to support payments on the underlying investments payment of interest and repayment of principal on assetbacked securities as well as the return associated with an equity investment in an assetbacked security is largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by the underlying loans or other assets backing the securities the risks and returns for investors like the fund in assetbacked securities depend on the tranche in which the investor holds an interest the debt tranches are entitled to receive payment before the equity if the cash flow generated by the underlying assets is insufficient to allow the vehicle to make payments on all of the tranches the debt tranches therefore may receive higher credit ratings if rated and the equity tranche may be considered more speculative many assetbacked securities in which the fund invests may be difficult to value and may be deemed illiquid assetbacked securities may have the effect of magnifying the fund’s exposure to changes in the value of the underlying assets and may also result in increased volatility in the fund’s nav this means the fund may have the potential for greater gains as well as the potential for greater losses than if the fund owned the underlying asset directly the value of an investment in the fund may be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent that the fund is exposed to assetbacked securities directly or indirectly in the event that the market for assetbacked securities experiences high volatility and a lack of liquidity the value of many of assetbacked securities may decline any mishandling of related documentation by a servicer may also affect the rights of the security holders in and to the underlying collateral creditcounterparty risk the value of a debt security depends on the issuer’s credit quality or ability to pay principal and interest when due the securities in which the fund may invest may have varying degrees of credit risk and subject to the fundamental investment restrictions which among other things prohibit the fund from investing in loans of subprime quality the fund will not be restricted by any borrower credit criteria or credit risk limitation the value of a debt security is likely to fall if an issuer or the guarantor of a security is unable or unwilling or perceived to be unable or unwilling to make timely principal andor interest payments or otherwise to honor its obligations or if the debt security’s rating is downgraded the obligations of issuers are subject to bankruptcy insolvency and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors the value of a debt security can also decline in response to other changes in market economic industry political and regulatory conditions that affect a particular type of debt security or issuer or debt securities generally such as conditions in the alternative lending market the values of many debt securities may fall in response to a general increase in investor risk aversion or a decline in the confidence of investors generally in the ability of issuers to meet their obligations    unlike other debt instruments that are rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the alternative lendingrelated securities in which the fund invests are typically unrated or rated only by the platform platforms may evaluate prospective borrowers by looking to a number of factors including the borrower’s credit history andor credit score as reported by one or more thirdparty credit reporting agencies the fund will rely on the borrower’s credit information which is provided by the platforms however as described under “default risk” such information may be out of date incomplete or inaccurate and may therefore not accurately reflect the borrower’s actual creditworthiness platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information and therefore the fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the making of a particular loan although the fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by platforms from which the fund purchases alternative lendingrelated securities the fund typically will not have access to all of the data that platforms utilize to assign credit scores to particular loans purchased directly or indirectly by the fund and will not independently diligence or confirm the truthfulness of such information or otherwise evaluate the basis for the platform’s credit score of those loans as a result the fund may make investments based on outdated inaccurate or incomplete information in addition the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that could potentially contain programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed this could adversely affect loan pricing data and approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or misclassified which could ultimately have a negative impact on the fund’s performance platform risk as discussed in more detail in “default risk” and “risk of unsecured loans” the fund receives payments on whole loans or securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on loans only if the platform servicing the loans receives the borrower’s payments on such loans and passes such payments through to the fund if a borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason the fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal or interest due as among other reasons the fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated the loan may be unsecured or undercollateralized andor it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower the fund may have limited knowledge about the underlying loans and will be dependent upon the platform for information regarding underlying loans although the fund conducts diligence on the platforms the fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information provided by the platforms other than payment information regarding loans and other alternative lendingrelated securities owned by the fund which the fund will observe directly as payments are received some investors including the fund may not review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general criteria of the investments as described above as a result the fund is dependent on the platforms’ ability to collect verify and provide information to the fund about each loan and borrower the fund will rely on the borrower’s credit information which is provided by the platforms however as described under “default risk” such information may be out of date incomplete or inaccurate and may therefore not accurately reflect the borrower’s actual creditworthiness platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information and therefore the fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the making of a particular loan although the fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by platforms from which the fund purchases alternative lendingrelated securities the fund typically will not have access to all of the data that platforms utilize to assign credit scores to particular loans purchased directly or indirectly by the fund and will not independently diligence or confirm the truthfulness of such information or otherwise evaluate the basis for the platform’s credit score of those loans as a result the fund may make investments based on outdated inaccurate or incomplete information in addition the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that could potentially contain    programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed this could adversely affect loan pricing data and approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or misclassified which could ultimately have a negative impact on the fund’s performance in addition the underlying loans in some cases may be affected by the success of the platforms through which they are facilitated therefore disruptions in the businesses of such platforms may also negatively impact the value of the fund’s investments in addition disruption in the business of a platform could limit or eliminate the ability of the fund to invest in loans originated by that platform and therefore the fund could lose some or all of the benefit of its diligence effort with respect to that platform the fund may also invest directly or indirectly in public or private equity securities of alternative lending platforms or enter into other financial transactions including derivative transactions to gain exposure to such investments the performance of equity instruments issued by a platform or derivatives thereon will depend on the success of the platform’s business and operations as described above the fund may also invest in shares certificates notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans platforms are forprofit businesses that as a general matter generate revenue by collecting fees on funded loans from borrowers and by assessing a loan servicing fee on investors which may be a fixed annual amount or a percentage of the loan or amounts collected this business could be disrupted in multiple ways for example a platform could file for bankruptcy or a platform might suffer reputational harm from negative publicity about the platform or alternative lending more generally and the loss of investor confidence in the event that a loan facilitated through the platform is not repaid and the investor loses money on its investment many platforms andor their affiliates have incurred operating losses since their inception and may continue to incur net losses in the future particularly as their businesses grow and they incur additional operating expenses the fund’s investments could be adversely impacted if a platform that services the fund’s investments becomes unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations to do so in order to mitigate this risk the fund would seek to rely on a backup servicer provided through the platform or through an unaffiliated backup servicer to the extent that it is not possible to collect on defaulted loans or to the extent borrowers prepay loans a platform that services loans may no longer be able to collect a servicing fee which would negatively impact its business operations these or other similar negative events could adversely affect the platforms’ businesses andor investor participation in a platform’s marketplace and in turn the business of the platforms which creates a risk of loss for the fund’s investments in securities issued by a platform or derivatives thereon platforms may have a higher risk profile than companies engaged in lines of business with a longer more established operating history and such investments should be viewed as longerterm investments alternative lending is a relatively new lending method and alternative lending platforms have relatively limited operating histories they have met with and will continue to meet with challenges including navigating evolving regulatory and competitive environments increasing the number of borrowers and investors utilizing their marketplace increasing the volume of loans facilitated through their marketplace and transaction fees received for matching borrowers and investors through their marketplace entering into new markets and introducing new loan products continuing to revise the marketplace’s proprietary credit decisions and scoring models continuing to develop maintain and scale their platforms effectively maintaining and scaling financial and risk management controls and procedures maintaining the security of the platform and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across the platform and attracting integrating and retaining an appropriate number of qualified employees a platform may enter into various business transactions including mergers or acquisitions which could require significant managerial attention disrupt business and adversely affect its financial results platforms are subject to risk of litigation and any such litigation may be costly to defend and distracting to management if platforms are not successful in addressing these issues the platforms’ businesses and their results of operations may be harmed which may reduce the possible available investments for the fund or negatively impact the value of the fund’s investments in platforms or in alternative lendingrelated securities more generally    certain platforms may work with banks in order to originate loans to borrowers and may rely on such banks to satisfy certain legal andor regulatory requirements if an originating bank suspended limited or ceased its operations if the bank’s relationship with the platform were terminated for any reason or if the bank’s ability or willingness to continue to serve this function on the current or equivalent terms were in any way curtailed the impacted platform would need to negotiate and implement a substantially similar arrangement with another bank satisfy any regulatory or licensing requirements with respect to the new bank or seek other solutions there can be no assurances that the platform in this type of situation would not be forced to curtail or suspend its operations platforms may have limited or no prior experience with transitioning loan originations to a new funding bank and the process may result in delays in the issuance of loans a platform’s inability to facilitate loans or other unforeseeable consequences if a platform is unable to enter in an alternative arrangement with a different funding bank the platform would need to obtain its own license in order to enable it to originate loans as well as comply with other laws which would be costly and timeconsuming in the us this would entail at minimum obtaining a license in each state in which the platform operates platforms operating in other jurisdictions would be subject to the regulatory requirements of those jurisdictions which may be burdensome and costly if a platform is unsuccessful in maintaining its relationships with the funding banks its ability to provide loan products could be materially impaired and its operating results would suffer the fund relies on the continued success of the platforms that facilitate the loans in which the fund invests if such platforms were impaired in their ability to operate their lending business the adviser may be required to seek alternative sources of investments which could adversely affect the fund’s performance andor prevent the fund from pursuing its investment objective and strategies platforms may rely on debt facilities and other forms of borrowing in order to finance many of the borrower loans they facilitate however these financing sources may become unavailable after their current maturity dates or the terms may become less favorable to the borrowing platforms as the volume of loans that a platform facilitates increases the platform may need to expand its borrowing capacity on its existing debt arrangements or may need to seek new sources of capital the availability of such financing depends on multiple factors some of which are outside of the platform’s control platforms may also default on or breach their existing debt agreements which could diminish or eliminate their access to funding at all or on terms acceptable to the platforms such events could cause the fund to incur losses on its investments that are dependent upon the performance of the platforms as discussed under “alternative lending operational and technology risk” platforms are subject to various risks relating to the extensive use of information technology as discussed under “regulatory risk” platforms may also be forced to defend legal action taken by regulators or governmental bodies alternative lending is a new industry operating in an evolving legal environment platforms may be subject to risk of litigation alleging violations of law andor regulations including for example consumer protection laws whether in the us or in foreign jurisdictions platforms may be unsuccessful in defending against such lawsuits or other actions and in addition to the costs incurred in fighting any such actions platforms may be required to pay money in connection with the judgments settlements or fines or may be forced to modify the terms of its borrower loans which could cause the platform to realize a loss or receive a lower return on a loan than originally anticipated platforms may also be parties to litigation or other legal action in an attempt to protect or enforce their rights or those of affiliates including intellectual property rights and may incur similar costs in connection with any such efforts a platform may rely on data centers or thirdparty service providers or vendors to deliver its services any disruption of the businesses of such third parties which may be subject to all of the foregoing risks could similarly impede the platform’s business and operations or could interrupt or delay a platform’s ability to deliver on its obligations the fund’s investments in the equity securities of platforms including common stock preferred stock warrants or convertible stock are subject to equity securities risk equity securities risk is the risk that the value of equity securities to which the fund is exposed will fall due to general market or economic conditions overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic instability currency interest rate and commodity    price fluctuations perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers participate and the particular circumstances and performance of the issuers market conditions may affect certain types of equity securities to a greater extent than other types for example equity securities of issuers in new or emerging industries may be more susceptible to market conditions and may experience volatility in returns equities to which the fund may be exposed are structurally subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater risk than debt instruments of such issuers the prices of equities are also sensitive to rising interest rates as the costs of capital rise and borrowing costs increase the equity securities of smaller less seasoned companies such as platforms or their affiliates are generally subject to greater price fluctuations limited liquidity higher transaction costs and higher investment risk smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may be dependent on a limited management group and may lack substantial capital reserves or an established performance record there may be generally less publicly available information about such companies than for larger more established companies to the extent that the fund invests in unlisted equity securities the investments generally will involve a higher degree of valuation and performance uncertainty and greater liquidity risk than investments in listed securities such issuers tend to be more susceptible to the actions of competitors and market conditions including general economic downturns often operate at a financial loss are more likely to depend on small numbers of key management persons such that the departure of any such persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and prospects of the company and generally have less predictable operating results investments that are unlisted at the time of acquisition may remain unlisted and may therefore be difficult to value andor realize preferred securities may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities in addition preferred securities generally pay a dividend and rank ahead of common stocks and behind debt securities in claims for dividends and for assets of the issuer in a liquidation or bankruptcy for this reason the value of preferred securities will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial condition or prospects preferred securities may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates when interest rates rise the fixed dividend on preferred securities may be less attractive causing the price of preferred stocks to decline preferred securities of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred stock of larger companies warrants are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time their prices do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of the underlying securities convertible securities are subject to the risks applicable generally to debt securities including credit risk convertible securities also react to changes in the value of the common stock into which they convert and are thus subject to market risk because the value of a convertible security can be influenced by both interest rates and the common stock’s market movements a convertible security generally is not as sensitive to interest rates as a similar debt security and generally will not vary in value in response to other factors to the same extent as the underlying common stock in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities typically would be paid before the company’s common stockholders but after holders of any senior debt obligations of the company the fund’s investments in shares certificates notes or other securities issued by a platform its affiliates or a special purpose entity sponsored by a platform or its affiliates that represent the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans may expose the fund to the credit risk of the issuer generally such securities are unsecured obligations of the issuer an issuer that becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings may be unable to make full and timely payments on its obligations to the fund even if the payments on the underlying loan or loans continue to be made timely and in full in addition when the fund owns such fractional loans or other securities the fund and its custodian generally will not have a contractual relationship with or personally identifiable information regarding individual borrowers so the fund will not be able to enforce underlying loans directly against borrowers and may not be able to appoint an alternative servicing agent in the event that a platform or thirdparty servicer as applicable ceases to service the underlying loans therefore the fund will be more dependent on the platform for servicing than in the case in which the fund owns whole loans where such interests are secured the fund relies on the platform to perfect the fund’s security interest in addition there may be a delay between the time the fund commits to purchase a security issued by a platform its affiliate or a special purpose entity sponsored by the platform or its affiliate and the    issuance of such security and during such delay the funds committed to such an investment will not earn interest on the investment nor will they be available for investment in other alternative lendingrelated securities which will reduce the effective rate of return on the investment the fund will invest primarily in whole loans and does not expect to invest a material portion of its portfolio in such fractional loans or other securities servicer risk the fund expects that all of its direct and indirect investments in loans originated by alternative lending platforms will be serviced by a platform or a thirdparty servicer loan servicing may entail the assessment andor collection of payments and fees from borrowers the allocation and payment of such amounts to investors and the execution of collections processes upon nonpayment of borrower loans which may include referral of overdue loans to collections personnel or outside collection agencies fees charged by a loan servicer reduce the returns on the fund’s investments in the event that the servicer is unable to service the loan there can be no guarantee that a backup servicer will be able to assume responsibility for servicing the loans in a timely or costeffective manner any resulting disruption or delay could jeopardize payments due to the fund in respect of its investments or increase the costs associated with the fund’s investments if the servicer becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding there is some risk that the fund’s investments could be recharacterized as a secured loan from the fund to the platform as described more fully with respect to the potential bankruptcy of a platform under “regulatory risk” which could result in uncertainty costs and delays from having the fund’s investment deemed part of the bankruptcy estate of the platform rather than an asset owned outright by the fund servicers may be subject to other risks described herein including “platform risk” regulatory risk the loan industry is highly regulated and the alternative lendingrelated securities in which the fund invests are subject to extensive rules and regulations issued by governmental authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which the fund invests these authorities also may impose obligations and restrictions on the platforms’ activities or those of other entities involved in the alternative lending process the platforms’ failure to comply with the requirements of applicable law may cause among other things the platforms to be required to register with governmental authorities andor the revocation of requisite licenses the voiding of loan contracts impairment of the enforcement of loans indemnification liability to contract counterparties class action lawsuits administrative enforcement actions andor civil and criminal liability in the relevant jurisdiction the evolving nature of the platforms’ respective business models may complicate their ability to determine the applicability of and to effect compliance with such requirements moreover legal and regulatory requirements and any interpretations of those requirements are subject to periodic changes any such change necessitating new significant compliance obligations could have an adverse effect on the platforms’ compliance costs and ability to operate the platforms could seek to pass through any increase in their costs to their borrowers or investors such as the fund in the form of higher origination or servicing fees in connection with the sale and servicing of the whole loans fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans the platforms typically make representations and warranties to investors such as the fund that the loans were originated and are being serviced in accordance with and in compliance with applicable laws and in some cases specifically with the laws described herein in all material respects despite these representations and warranties the fund cannot guarantee that the platforms have been and will continue to be in compliance with all applicable laws if those representations and warranties were not correct the platforms could be required to repurchase the loans but the fund cannot be certain that the platform would be required and able to repurchase loans in all such cases the information below provides additional detail on some of the laws rules and regulations relevant to the fund’s investments    regulatory regime in the united states the platforms may be subject to laws including but not limited to the following in the united states     •   federal and state laws and regulations related to disclosures to and consents from borrowers and prospective borrowers and loan terms credit discrimination credit reporting debt servicing and collection and unfair or deceptive business practices     •   state consumer loan

bank secrecy act which relates to compliance with antimoney laundering customer due diligence and recordkeeping policies and procedures    these rules require extensive disclosure to and consents from borrowers and prospective borrowers prohibit discrimination and may impose multiple qualification and licensing obligations on platform activities the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” has broad authority over the us consumerfocused businesses in which certain platforms engage this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws such as the truth in lending act and the equal credit opportunity act to supervise and conduct regulatory examinations of banks with more than  billion in assets and certain nonbanks and to enforce federal consumer financial protection laws against market participants including the platforms the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority to assist in its enforcement the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the loans that platforms facilitate this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus until the cfpb issues a final rulemaking defining which nonbank larger participants in the consumer lending market will be subject to the cfpb’s supervisory authority which includes the ability to conduct regulatory examinations the platforms are only subject to the cfpb’s rulemaking and enforcement authority the cfpb is expected to initiate a rulemaking setting forth new requirements and restrictions applicable to payday loans automobile title loans and certain installment loans in the first quarter of  which may impact some of the loans offered by certain platforms in connection with that rulemaking the cfpb may issue a rule defining the nonbank larger participants in the consumer installment loan market that will become subject to cfpb supervision and examination which could be written to cover the platforms there is uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact the platforms’ businesses and their results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services making them less attractive and restricting the platforms’ ability to offer them actions by the cfpb or other regulators against the platforms their funding banks or their competitors that discourage the use of the alternative lending model or suggest to consumers the desirability of other loan products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of borrowers or investors the platforms’ compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if the cfpb or other regulators enact new regulations change regulations that were previously adopted modify through supervision or enforcement past regulatory guidance or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than previous interpretations in addition to the cfpb the federal trade commission can investigate and enforce consumer protection statutes pursuant to its authority under section  of the federal trade commission act also the platforms may be subject to regulatory examination by state authorities particularly in states where the platforms are licensed moreover platforms that collaborate with a bank to offer loans may be subject to the supervision of the bank’s regulator different platforms adhere to different business models subject to different regulatory requirements for example one platform may operate from a particular state to make loans to small and midsized businesses across the united states the platform must comply with that state’s licensing requirements and possible usury limitations however other states could seek to regulate the platform on the basis that loans were made to borrowers located in such other states in that case loans made in those other states could be subject to the maximum interest rate limits usury laws if any of such jurisdiction which in turn could limit revenues for the fund moreover it could further subject the platform to such states’ licensing requirements and potentially to penalties for having previously conducted business in such states without a license which could adversely impact the platform or in some cases the enforceability of some or all of the terms of loans made by the platform without a license another platform may follow a different model in which all loans sourced by the platform are made by a bank the platform may provide certain services to assist the bank in making the loan but the loans will be made subject to the bank’s underwriting guidelines funding for the loans will come from the bank’s own resources and the bank will be the named payee on the loans as a result the bank is generally considered to be the “true lender” of the loans originated through the platform however if challenged courts may instead decide that the platform is the true lender of the loans plaintiffs have challenged various bank affiliation arrangements involving    a variety of nonbank partners often in market segments in which the fund does not intend to invest such as payday lending and refund anticipation lending given the fact specific nature of these cases courts have recently applied differing interpretations when determining which party is the true lender the resulting uncertainty may increase the possibility of claims brought against the platforms by borrowers seeking to void their loans or to subject the platforms to increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions to the extent that the platform is deemed to be the true lender in any jurisdiction instead of the originating bank whether determined by a regulatory agency at the state or federal level or by a court loans made to borrowers in that jurisdiction would be subject to the maximum interest rate limits usury laws of such jurisdiction and existing loans may be unenforceable and the platform could be subject to additional regulatory requirements in addition to any penalties and fines moreover it may be determined that this business model is not sustainable in its current form which could ultimately cause such platforms to alter or terminate their businesses in such circumstances there could be a material adverse effect on the fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy alternative lending platforms may be subject to risk of litigation alleging violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts including fraud moreover many alternative lendingrelated securities loans in particular are written using standardized documentation thus many borrowers may be similarly situated insofar as the provisions of their contractual obligations are concerned accordingly allegations of violations of the provisions of applicable federal or state consumer protection laws could potentially result in a large class of claimants asserting claims against the platforms and other related entities the interest rates that certain us platforms charge to borrowers are based upon the ability under us federal law of the funding banks that originate the loans to export the interest rates of its home state to provide uniform rates to all borrowers in all states that have not opted out certain primary funding banks for some of the platforms export the interest rates of utah which generally allows parties to agree by contract to any interest rate the current annual percentage rates offered by these banks through the platforms for personal loans range from approximately  to  certain states including utah have no statutory interest rate limitations on personal loans while other jurisdictions have a maximum rate that is less than the current maximum rate offered by these banks through the platforms if a borrower were to successfully bring claims against one of the platforms for state usury law violations or other similar violations and the rate on that borrower’s personal loan were greater than that allowed under the applicable state law the platforms could be subject to among other things fines and penalties if the platforms’ ability to export the interest rates and related terms and conditions permitted under a particular state’s law to borrowers in other states is determined to violate applicable lending laws a platform could be subject to the interest rate restrictions and related terms and conditions of the lending laws of each of the states in which it operates this could significantly and adversely impact the platforms’ operations and ability to operate and they may be forced to end or significantly change their business and activities resulting in a reduction in the volume of loans available for investment by investors such as the fund even in the absence of regulations plaintiffs may successfully challenge the funding bank or other lending models recent case law has cast doubt on the viability of the model in which many platforms operate and in particular their ability to charge the same rate as a funding bank after a loan has been sold to the platform the us court of appeals for the second circuit recently issued a significant decision that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the national bank act the “nba” and held that a nonbank assignee of loans sourced by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of nba preemption as to state law claims of usury although the decision is binding only in connecticut new york and vermont it may significantly affect nonbank assignees of loans including the loan origination practices of certain participants in the alternative lendingrelated industry at a minimum nonbank assigneespurchasers of bank loans may face uncertainty regarding their ability to rely upon federal preemption of state usury laws in addition a number of alternative lending platforms purchase loans from statechartered banks promptly after origination and rely upon federal preemption to exempt the loans from state usury caps the decision although directly ruling on purchasers of national bank loans could be applied to those purchases by courts considering the scope of federal preemption under the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of  which generally preempts state usury laws in favor of federally insured statechartered banks the second circuit’s decision appears to be contrary to    other federal circuit court decisions and inconsistent with longstanding commercial practice the decision has been appealed to the us supreme court where the court is considering whether to accept the appeal if the court does not accept the appeal or upholds the second circuit’s ruling additional legal issues including the enforceability of the choice of law election in the borrowers’ contracts will be determined by further action at the us district court therefore the impact of this decision is uncertain ultimately if the decision is not accepted for appeal or is upheld on appeal and is widely applied certain alternative lenders will likely be required to restructure certain aspects of their operations and certain loans previously made by them through funding banks may not be subject to state usury limitations on the interest rate charged as a result if the fund holds these us loans directly or indirectly at the time of such potential action the fund could suffer losses in addition numerous other statutory provisions including federal bankruptcy laws and related state laws may interfere with or affect the ability of an investor to enforce a loan facilitated through an alternative lending platform if a platform or related entity were to go into bankruptcy or become the subject of an insolvency proceeding the platform or related entity may stop performing its services with respect to the loans any replacement servicer retained for such services may assess higher fees andor demand additional less favorable terms with respect to its obligations the servicer may also have the power in connection with a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and with the approval of the court or the bankruptcy trustee or similar official to assign its rights and obligations as servicer to a third party without the consent and even over the objection of any affected parties if the servicer is a debtor in bankruptcy or the subject of an insolvency or similar proceeding this may limit the ability of affected parties to enforce the obligations of the servicer to collect any amount owing by the servicer or to terminate and replace the servicer in addition the sale of whole loans to the fund may be found by a bankruptcy court not to have been a true sale but recharacterized as a secured loan from the fund to the platform if such a recharacterization occurs most platform loan purchase agreements provide that the platform grants a security interest to the fund in the loans subject to the purchase agreement but the fund would incur the resulting uncertainty costs and delays from having its loans deemed part of the bankruptcy estate of the platform rather than assets owned outright by the fund a bankruptcy court may also reduce the monthly payments due under the related contract or loan andor change the rate of interest and time of repayment of the indebtedness borrowers may delay or suspend making payments on loans because of the uncertainties occasioned by the bankruptcy or similar proceeding to which a platform or its related entities are subject even if the borrowers have no legal right to do so it is possible that a period of adverse economic conditions resulting in high defaults and delinquencies on alternative lendingrelated securities will increase the potential bankruptcy risk to platforms and its related entities in july  the us treasury department issued an informational request about the benefits and risks associated with new online lending platforms the information requested asked for responses on various topics including how alternative lenders manage the risk of fraud and hacker attacks how they protect consumers against scams or default how much investors in the loans rely on borrowed money and whether the lenders should have to put up their own capital to back loans they originate or underwrite the information request is in the informationcollecting stage and no interpretive guidance has currently been released the fund cannot predict what form any such rulemaking or interpretive guidance may take in addition the fund cannot provide any assurance that the outcome of the information request will not require additional regulatory changes to the business models of platforms that may adversely affect the platforms’ businesses if a change in the laws or the interpretations of current laws were to occur certain us platforms could be required to either change the manner in which they conduct certain aspects of their operations or halt certain business operations all together which could have a material adverse effect on the fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy at any time there may be litigation pending against banks that issue or originate loans for the platforms any such litigation may significantly and adversely impact the platforms’ ability to make loans or subject them to fines and penalties which could consequently have a material adverse effect on the fund the platforms could also be forced to comply with the lending laws of all us states which may not be feasible and could result in platforms ceasing to operate any increase in cost or regulatory burden on a platform could have a material adverse effect on the fund specifically adverse rulings by courts in pending and potential future litigation could    undermine the basis of platforms’ business models and could result ultimately in a platform or its lender members investors being characterized as a lender which as a consequence would mean that additional us consumer protection laws would be applicable to the borrower member loans sourced on such platforms potentially rendering such borrower member loans voidable or unenforceable in addition a platform or its lender members could be subject to claims by borrower members as well as enforcement actions by regulators even if a platform were not required to cease conducting business with residents of certain states or to change its business practices to comply with applicable laws and regulations the platform or its lender members could be required to register or obtain and maintain licenses or regulatory approvals in all  us states at substantial cost if a platform were subject to fines penalties or other regulatory action or ceased to operate this could have a material adverse effect on the fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy in addition to laws governing the activities of lenders and servicers a limited number of states require purchasers of certain loans primarily consumer loans to be licensed or registered in order to own the loans or in certain states to collect a rate of interest above a specified rate the fund intends to obtain licenses where required in order to pursue its investment strategy to the extent the fund obtains such licenses or is required to comply with related regulatory requirements the fund could be subject to increased costs and regulatory oversight by governmental authorities that may have an adverse effect on its results or operations if the fund were delayed in obtaining or were unable to obtain required licenses in certain states this could limit its ability to invest in loans to borrowers in those states because loans are not ordinarily registered with the sec or any state securities commission or listed on any securities exchange there is usually less publicly available information about such instruments in addition loans in which the fund invests may not be considered “securities” for purposes of the antifraud protections of the federal securities laws in the event certain loans in which the fund invests are not considered securities as a purchaser of these instruments the fund may not be entitled to the antifraud protections of the federal securities laws the fund has been advised by the staff of the sec that it is the view of the sec and its staff that the purchase of whole loans through alternative lending platforms involves the purchase of “securities” under the securities act of  as amended issued by the originating platforms if platforms or any related entities are required to register as investment companies under the  act or as investment advisers under the investment advisers act of  their ability to conduct business may be materially adversely affected and contracts entered into by a platform or related entity while in violation of the registration requirements may be voidable this could adversely affect the fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy the us federal fair debt collection practices act “fdcpa” provides guidelines and limitations on the conduct of thirdparty debt servicers in connection with the collection of consumer debts in order to ensure compliance with the fdcpa us platforms often contract with professional thirdparty debt collection agencies to engage in debt collection activities with respect to consumer debts the cfpb the us federal agency now responsible for administering the fdcpa is engaged in comprehensive rulemaking regarding the operation of the fdcpa which likely will affect the obligations of sellers of debt to third parties as well as change other regulatory requirements any such changes could have an adverse effect on any us platforms following a certain model and therefore on the fund as an investor through such platforms the us fair credit reporting act “fcra” regulates consumer credit reporting under the fcra liability may be imposed on furnishers of data to credit reporting agencies to the extent that adverse credit information reported is false or inaccurate us federal law provides borrower service members on active military service with rights that may delay or impair a platform’s ability to collect on a loan the servicemembers civil relief act “scra” requires that the interest rate on preexisting debts such as service member loans be set at no more than  while the qualified service member or reservist is on active duty an investor in an alternative lendingrelated security that is dependent on the performance of such a loan such as the fund will not receive the difference between  and the original stated interest rate for the loan during any such period this law also permits courts to stay proceedings and execution of judgments against service members and reservists on active duty which may delay    recovery on any loans in default and accordingly payments on the instruments that are dependent on these loans if there are any amounts under such a loan still due and owing to the platform after the final maturity of the instrument that corresponds to the loan a platform may have no further obligation to make payments on the instrument to the fund even if the platform later receives payments after the final maturity of the instrument platforms do not take military service into account in assigning loan grades to borrower service member loan requests in addition platforms do not request prospective borrowers to confirm if they are a qualified service member or reservists within the meaning of the scra as part of the borrower registration process lender liability a number of judicial decisions have upheld judgments of borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith commercial reasonableness and fair dealing or a similar duty owed to the borrower or has assumed an excessive degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders if a loan held directly or indirectly by the fund were found to have been made or serviced under circumstances that give rise to lender liability the borrower’s obligation to repay that loan could be reduced or eliminated or the fund’s recovery on that loan could be otherwise impaired which would adversely impact the value of that loan in limited cases courts have subordinated the loans of a senior lender to a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower when the senior lender or its agents such as a loan servicer is found to have engaged in unfair inequitable or fraudulent conduct with respect to the other creditors if a loan held directly or indirectly by the fund were subject to such subordination it would be junior in right of payment to other indebtedness of the borrower which could adversely impact the value of that loan regulatory regime in the united kingdom the fund may invest in alternative lendingrelated securities through platforms domiciled in the uk such platforms must be authorized and regulated by the financial conduct authority “fca” in order to engage in the regulated activity of “operating an electronic system in relation to lending” following changes to consumer credit regulation in april  the fca is currently allowing application periods giving platforms with interim permission a threemonth window in which they must apply to the fca for full authorization if any platform through which the fund invests were to fail to obtain full authorization the platform might be forced to cease its operations which would disrupt the servicing and administration of loans to which the fund has exposure through that platform any such disruption may impact the quality of debt collection procedures in relation to those loans and may result in reduced returns to the fund from those investments the fca has recently also introduced new regulatory controls for platform operators including the application of conduct of business rules in particular relating to disclosure and promotions minimum capital requirements client money protection rules dispute resolution rules and a requirement for firms to take reasonable steps to ensure existing loans continue to the administered if the firm goes out of business the introduction of these regulations and any further new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on uk platforms’ businesses and may result in interruption of operations by such platforms or the passing on of the costs of increased regulatory compliance to investors such as the fund in the form of higher origination or servicing fees the fund may invest in loans that constitute regulated credit agreements consumer credit loans under the financial services and markets act  “fsma” article b of the amended financial services and markets act  regulated activities order  the “rao” provides that the activity of entering into a regulated credit agreement as lender or exercising or having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and duties under such credit agreement requires fca authorization however article i of the rao and paragraph  of the schedule    to the financial services and markets act  exemption order  provide exemptions from authorization to persons who acquire rights under a regulated credit agreements but who do not make any such loans or extend any new credit provided that the servicer of such loans is appropriately authorized by the fca the fund is not authorized by the fca in respect of consumer credit activities to the extent that it acquires any loans which are regulated credit agreements under fsma the fund will be required to ensure that a person with the appropriate fca authorization is engaged to service such regulated credit agreements in accordance with the exemptions from authorization under article b and paragraph  outlined above if the fca were to successfully challenge the fund’s reliance on this exemption this could adversely affect the fund’s ability to invest in consumer loans in the united kingdom or other alternative lendingrelated securities relating to such consumer loans and could subject to the fund to costs that could adversely affect the results of the fund regulatory regime in other jurisdictions the platforms and their investors may face regulation in the other jurisdictions in which the fund invests many other jurisdictions have regulatory regimes in place to authorize or regulate platforms if any entity operating a platform through which the fund invests or any entity that is the lender under a loan agreement facilitated by that platform were to lose its license or have its license suspended or revoked the platform might be forced to cease its operations which could impair the ability of the fund to pursue its investment strategy by investing in loans originated by that platform and could disrupt the servicing and administration of loans to which the fund has exposure through that platform any such disruption could impact the quality of debt collection procedures in relation to those loans and could result in reduced returns to the fund from those investments in addition some jurisdictions may regulate the terms of loans issued through a platform or impose additional requirements on investments in such loans which could impact the value of alternative lendingrelated securities purchased from a platform operating in such a jurisdiction or the ability of the fund to pursue its investment strategy by investing in loans originated by such a platform new or amended laws or regulations could disrupt the business operations of platforms operating in jurisdictions in which the fund invests and could result in the platforms passing on of increased regulatory compliance costs to investors such as the fund in the form of higher origination or servicing fees privacy and data security laws glba and other laws limit the disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties and require financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with both affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties many states and a number of nonus jurisdictions have enacted privacy and data security laws requiring safeguards on the privacy and security of consumers’ personally identifiable information other laws deal with obligations to safeguard and dispose of private information in a manner designed to avoid its dissemination privacy rules adopted by the us federal trade commission implement glba and other requirements and govern the disclosure of consumer financial information by certain financial institutions ranging from banks to private investment funds us platforms following certain models generally are required to have privacy policies that conform to these glba and other requirements in addition such platforms typically have policies and procedures intended to maintain platform participants’ personal information securely and dispose of it properly the fund generally does not intend to obtain or hold borrowers’ nonpublic personal information and the fund intends to implement procedures designed to prevent the disclosure of borrowers’ nonpublic personal information to the fund however service providers to the fund including the fund’s custodians and the platforms acting as loan servicers for the fund may obtain hold or process such information while the fund will adopt policies and procedures regarding the platforms’ and custodian’s protection and use of nonpublic personal information the fund cannot guarantee the security of that data and cannot guarantee that service providers have been and will continue to comply with glba other data security and privacy laws and any other related regulatory requirements violations of glba and other laws could subject the fund to litigation andor    fines penalties or other regulatory action which individually or in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on the fund the fund may also face regulations related to privacy and data security in the other jurisdictions in which the fund invests leverage risk the fund or a subsidiary of the fund may obtain financing to make investments in alternative lendingrelated securities the fund expects that such borrowings will be secured by alternative lendingrelated securities held by the fund or a subsidiary the fund also may obtain leverage through derivative instruments or assetbacked securities that afford the fund economic leverage leverage magnifies the fund’s exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying reference assets or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have and may be considered a speculative technique for example if the fund obtains structural leverage through one or more subsidiaries that finance their investments in alternative lendingrelated securities a decrease in the value of those securities will negatively impact the fund’s net asset value to a greater extent than if the fund had not used leverage for this reason the value of an investment in the fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments that have embedded leverage in addition the fund’s interests in subsidiaries that have entered into borrowing arrangements typically will rank after such borrowings and if the subsidiaries’ assets decline in value the return on the fund’s equity interest may be adversely affected market conditions may unfavorably impact the fund’s or its subsidiaries’ ability to secure borrowings on terms as favorable as more established borrowers in the market or to obtain financing on commercially feasible terms to the extent the fund or a subsidiary is able to secure financing fluctuations in interest rates could increase the costs associated with the fund’s or subsidiary’s use of certain forms of leverage and such costs could reduce the fund’s return the  act requires a closedend fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than  of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness as defined in the  act and generally requires a closedend fund to make provision to prohibit the declaration of any dividend except a dividend payable in stock of the fund or distribution on the fund’s stock or the repurchase of any of the fund’s stock unless at the time of the declaration or repurchase there is asset coverage of at least  after deducting the amount of the dividend distribution or purchase price as the case may be to satisfy  act requirements in connection with leverage or to meet obligations the fund may be required to dispose of portfolio securities when such disposition might not otherwise be desirable engaging in such transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements because as discussed in more detail under “illiquidity risk” the fund’s portfolio will be substantially illiquid any such disposition or liquidation could result in losses to the fund there can be no assurances that the fund’s use of leverage will be successful securitization risk in connection with the sale or contribution by the fund or its subsidiaries of certain of their alternative lendingrelated investments to any special purpose entity formed for the purpose of acquiring alternative lendingrelated investments and issuing securities the fund or its subsidiaries may be required to make certain representations about the alternative lendingrelated investments sold or contributed to such special purpose entity the fund or its subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify such special purpose entity or to repurchase the alternative lendingrelated investments to which such representations relate to the extent that any of such representation is found to have been inaccurate on the date that it was made in making such representations the fund or applicable subsidiary may rely upon certain representations and warranties made to the fund by the platform from which the fund or such subsidiary originally acquired the relevant alternative lendingrelated investment if the fund or the applicable subsidiary relies on any such representations made by a platform the fund or such subsidiary is expected to have a right of indemnification from or a right to sell the relevant alternative lendingrelated investment back to such platform if such representations by such platform are found to have been    inaccurate on the date on which they were made in the event that the fund or the applicable subsidiary is required to indemnify or to repurchase alternative lendingrelated investments from a special purpose entity as a result of a representation made by the fund to such special purpose entity it is expected that the fund or such subsidiary will seek to recoup its losses by exercising its rights to a similar remedy against the platform from which it purchased such alternative lendingrelated investments however it is possible that the fund or such subsidiary will not be able to obtain representations from the relevant platform that back up all representations required to be made by the fund in connection with a securitization and the fund may be unable to recoup some or all of such losses through such arrangements risk of fraud the fund may be subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with the various parties involved in alternative lending including the platforms banks borrowers and third parties handling borrower and investor information prospective borrowers may materially misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms including their credit history the existence or value of purported collateral the purpose of the loan their occupation or their employment status platforms may not verify all of the information provided by prospective borrowers as discussed under “creditcounterparty risk” the accuracy of a platform’s evaluation of a borrower’s creditworthiness could be significantly impaired if based on flawed information except where a platform is required to repurchase loans or indemnify investors fraud may adversely affect the fund’s ability to receive the principal and interest payments that it expects to receive on its investments and therefore may negatively impact the fund’s performance a platform may have the exclusive right and ability to investigate claims of borrower identity theft which creates a conflict of interest as platforms may be obligated to repurchase loans andor indemnify investors in the loans in the case of fraud and may therefore have an incentive to deny or fail to investigate properly a claim of fraud furthermore there can be no guarantee that the resources technologies or fraud prevention measures implemented by a platform will be sufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud the fund is also subject to the risk of fraudulent activity by a platform or a backup servicer in the event that a platform or backup servicer engages in fraudulent activity the pools of loans originated by the platform or any loans serviced by the platform or backup servicer may be impaired or may not be of the quality that the fund anticipated thereby increasing the risk of default in respect of such loans below investment grade securities and unrated securities risk the fund may have exposure without limitation to investments that are rated below investment grade or that are unrated but are judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality the alternative lendingrelated securities in which the fund invests or in the case of assetbacked securities the loans that back them typically are not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization although the fund’s fundamental investment restrictions do not permit the fund to invest in loans of subprime quality some unrated securities purchased by the fund may be of credit quality comparable to securities rated below investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization in addition the fund may invest in securities that are rated below investment grade below investment grade debt securities which are commonly called “junk bonds” are rated below bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or baa by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” or have comparable ratings by another rating organization accordingly certain of the fund’s unrated investments could constitute a highly risky and speculative investment similar to an investment in “junk bonds” as described under “creditcounterparty risk” in evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers of such unrated loans the adviser may rely on the ratings ascribed to such borrowers by the relevant platform the adviser may also rely on reports from one or more independent vendors as part of its investment process or may create its own internal risk model for this purpose the analysis of the creditworthiness of borrowers may be less reliable than for more traditional borrowings such as bank loans and more complex than for issuers of higherrated investments the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective may as a result be more dependent upon the platform’s credit analysis than would be the    case if the fund had exposure to more traditional investments in addition such investments may be subject to greater risks than other investments including greater levels of risk related to changes in interest rates credit risk including a greater risk of default and liquidity risk there is a greater risk of loss associated with alternative lendingrelated securities investments and the ability of a borrower to make principal andor interest payments is predominantly speculative for below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the adviser to have a similar quality borrowers may be in default or have a currently identifiable vulnerability to default on their payments of principal andor interest or may otherwise present elements of danger with respect to payments of principal or interest below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry or business conditions than highergrade investments yields on below investment grade investments will fluctuate and may therefore cause the fund’s value to be more volatile certain investments of the fund may be downgraded to below investment grade status or may be judged by the adviser to be of comparable quality after the fund purchases them pursuant to the fundamental investment restrictions the fund will not invest of loans of subprime quality interest rate risk the values of the fund’s investments in incomeproducing alternative lendingrelated securities such as whole loans other debt instruments preferred securities and convertible securities change in response to interest rate changes in general the value of a debt security is likely to fall as interest rates rise this risk is generally greater for obligations with longer maturities or for debt securities that do not pay current interest debt securities with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes although to the extent the fund’s income is based on shortterm interest rates that fluctuate over short periods of time income received by the fund may decrease as a result of a decline in interest rates floating rate loans can also decrease in value if their interest rates do not rise as quickly or as much as market interest rates conversely variable rate instruments generally will not increase in value if interest rates decline when interest rates increase or for other reasons debt securities may be repaid more slowly than expected as a result the maturity of the debt instrument may be extended increasing the potential for loss interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable a wide variety of factors can cause interest rates to fluctuate eg central bank monetary policies inflation rates general economic conditions and market developments and debt securities may be particularly volatile during such periods currently certain interest rates are at or near historic lows and as a result they are likely to rise over time which may cause the value of the fund’s investments and therefore the fund’s net asset value to decrease prepayment risk borrowers may decide to prepay all or a portion of the remaining principal amount due under a loan at any time without penalty unless the underlying loan agreement provides for prepayment penalties prepayment reduces the yield to maturity and the average life of a loan or other security in the event of a prepayment of all or a portion of the remaining unpaid principal amount of a loan to which the fund has investment exposure the fund will receive such prepayment but further interest will cease to accrue on the prepaid portion of the loan after the date of the prepayment if the fund buys a security at a premium the premium could be lost in the event of a prepayment in periods of falling interest rates the rate of prepayments and price fluctuation tends to increase as borrowers are incentivized to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates borrowers may also seek to prepay debt obligations in order to refinance at lower interest rates if their credit standing improves such that they are eligible to borrow at a lower interest rate during such periods the fund generally will be forced to reinvest the prepayment proceeds at lower rates of return than the fund expected to earn on the prepaid assets provided that the fund is able to identify suitable reinvestment opportunities which may adversely impact the fund’s performance    illiquidity risk to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid investments illiquidity risk is the risk that the investments held by the fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the fund would like or at the price that the fund believes the security is currently worth alternative lendingrelated securities which typically are contractually nontransferable are not listed on any securities exchange andor are not registered under the securities act of  are illiquid furthermore an active reliable secondary market for alternative lendingrelated securities does not currently exist and there can be no assurance that an active market will develop to the extent that there is any secondary market for the fund’s alternative lendingrelated investments it is likely initially to be overthecounter as opposed to exchangetraded and may therefore provide less transparency such markets may also be smaller and less active than the market for investments that are higherrated which may adversely affect the prices at which the fund can sell its investments and may result in losses to the fund at any given time the fund’s portfolio will be substantially illiquid the fund’s ability to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate certain assets may be impaired andor result in losses to the fund the fund may be unable to sell its investments even under circumstances when the adviser believes it would be in the best interests of the fund to do so illiquid investments may also be difficult to value and their pricing may be more volatile than more liquid investments which could adversely affect the price at which the fund is able to sell such instruments investors like the fund that are acquiring or otherwise gaining exposure to such loans and other related instruments usually must among other things hold the loans through maturity in order to recoup their entire investment and during that time will be unable to make additional investments using the capital that is put towards such investments or any proceeds on a potential sale of such investments illiquidity risk also may be greater in times of financial stress the risks associated with illiquid instruments may be particularly acute in situations in which the fund’s operations require cash such as in connection with repurchase offers and could result in the fund borrowing to meet its shortterm needs or incurring losses on the sale of illiquid instruments valuation risk the fund is subject to valuation risk which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the fund invests are priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data market instability or human error the fund anticipates using a thirdparty pricing service to value the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities as market quotations generally are not available for the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities there is no assurance that the fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss because a portfolio security is sold at a discount to its established value if securities are mispriced shareholders could lose money upon redemption or could pay too much for shares purchased competition rampup and exposure risks the market for alternative lendingrelated securities is highly competitive and rapidly evolving the fund faces competition for access to platforms and alternative lendingrelated securities including from other institutional investors such competitors may have higher risk tolerance greater financial or other resources andor other advantages the competitive pressures the fund faces may impact the fund’s ability to make investments consistent with its investment objective various platforms also compete with one other as well as with more traditional lenders including banks with substantially greater financial resources if the fund is inhibited from deploying capital in a timely or efficient manner it may be forced to invest in cash cash equivalents or other assets that may result in lower returns than may otherwise be available through investments in alternative lendingrelated securities the success of any given platform and therefore the success of the fund will depend among other things on a continuous demand for loans from qualified borrowers there can be no assurance that such demand will continue to exist    there can be no assurances as to how long it will take the fund to invest the net proceeds of the offering and the longer the period the greater the likelihood that the fund’s performance will be adversely affected pending deployment of the net proceeds of the offering the fund generally will invest cash held in cash deposits and cash equivalents the fund will limit the sale of its securities based on the adviser’s assessment of its ability to invest the proceeds in an effective and timely manner if the fund’s access to platforms is limited whether due to rampup termination of existing arrangements or failure to secure arrangements with other platforms its exposure to the risks of the platforms to which the fund is exposed as discussed under “platform risk” and the risks of increased exposure to a potentially more limited pool of portfolio investments may increase moreover a platform may be unable to sustain its current lending model or may change its underwriting or credit models borrower acquisition channels quality of debt collection procedures andor servicing models in ways that may make such investments unsuitable for the fund such changes may occur after the fund has already made its investments and as most of the fund’s alternative lendingrelated securities are illiquid the fund may not be able to divest itself of the instruments at all or at an advantageous time or price the fund initially anticipates that a substantial portion of its alternative lendingrelated investments will be associated with the group of platforms that the adviser has diligenced at the time that the fund commences investment operations even if the fund is exposed to a varied pool of assets the fund’s investment focus on alternative lendingrelated securities will cause the fund to be subject to greater overall risk than if the fund’s exposures were less focused as it will be exposed to events affecting the alternative lendingrelated industry even if the fund’s investments are varied as to borrower type geographic location loan purpose or other features they may nevertheless have some similar characteristics and may therefore be subject to many of the same risks andor regulatory regimes and may respond in a similar manner to particular economic market political or other developments geographic focus risk the fund will seek to build a geographically diverse portfolio with assets initially focused primarily in the us europe australia and new zealand the fund is not subject to any geographic restrictions when investing in alternative lendingrelated securities and therefore could focus its investments in a particular geographic region whether in the us or abroad a geographic focus in a particular region may expose the fund to an increased risk of loss due to risks associated with that region certain regions from time to time will experience weaker economic conditions than others and consequently will likely experience higher rates of delinquency and loss than on similar investments across the geographic regions to which the fund is exposed in the event that a significant portion of the alternative lendingrelated securities of the fund relate to loans owed by borrowers resident or operating in certain specific geographic regions any localized economic conditions weather events natural or manmade disasters or other factors affecting those regions in particular could increase delinquency and defaults on the assets to which the fund is exposed and could negatively impact fund performance further any focus of the fund’s alternative lendingrelated investments in one or more regions would have a disproportionate effect on the fund if governmental authorities in any such region took action against any of the participants in the alternative lending industry doing business in that region foreign securities risk the fund may invest directly or indirectly in the alternative lendingrelated securities of foreign issuers such investments may involve risks not ordinarily associated with exposure to alternative lendingrelated securities of us issuers the foreign alternative lending industry may be subject to less governmental supervision and regulation than exists in the us conversely foreign regulatory regimes applicable to the alternative lending industry may be more complex and more restrictive than those in the us resulting in higher costs associated with such investments and such regulatory regimes may be subject to interpretation or change without prior notice to investors such as the fund foreign platforms may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the us due to difference in legal systems there may    be difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment outside the us for example bankruptcy laws may differ across the jurisdictions in which the fund may invest and it may be difficult for the servicer to pursue borrowers who borrow through nonus platforms in addition to the extent that investments are made in a limited number of countries events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the fund the fund’s investments in foreign securities may be subject to risks of increased transaction costs potential delays in settlement or unfavorable differences between the us economy and foreign economies the fund’s exposure to alternative lendingrelated securities issued by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which may adversely affect the net return on such investments as described further under “currency risk” fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls may adversely affect the market value of the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities of foreign issuers the fund is unlikely to be able to pass through to its shareholders foreign income tax credits in respect of any foreign income taxes it pays currency risk currency risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the market value of the fund’s investments currency risk includes the risk that the foreign currencies in which the fund’s investments are traded in which the fund receives income or in which the fund has taken a position will decline in value relative to the us dollar currency risk also includes the risk that a currency to which the fund has obtained exposure through hedging declines in value relative to the currency being hedged in which event the fund may realize a loss both on the hedging instrument and on the currency being hedged there can be no assurances or guarantees that any efforts the fund makes to hedge exposure to foreign exchange rate risks that arise as a result of its investments will successfully hedge against such risks or that adequate hedging arrangements will be available on an economically viable basis and in some cases hedging arrangements may result in additional costs being incurred or losses being greater than if hedging had not been used currency exchange rates can fluctuate significantly for many reasons derivative transactions in foreign currencies such as futures forwards options and swaps may involve leverage risk in addition to currency risk the fund’s shares are priced purchased and redeemed in us dollars and the distributions paid by the fund are paid in us dollars however a portion of the fund’s assets may be denominated in foreign nonus currencies and income received by the fund from a portion of its investments may be paid in foreign currencies in purchasing or selling local currency to fund trades denominated in that currency the fund will be exposed to the risk that the value of the foreign currency will increase or decrease which may impact the value of the fund’s investments in foreign currencies securities denominated in foreign currencies derivatives that provide exposure to foreign currencies and the fund’s income available for distribution some countries have and may continue to adopt internal economic policies that affect their currency valuations in a manner that may be disadvantageous for us investors or us companies seeking to do business in those countries for example a foreign government may unilaterally devalue its currency against other currencies which typically would have the effect of reducing the us dollar value of investments denominated in that currency in addition a country may impose formal or informal currency exchange controls these controls may restrict or prohibit the fund’s ability to repatriate both investment capital and income which could undermine the value and liquidity of the fund’s portfolio holdings and potentially place the fund’s assets at risk of total loss as a result if the exchange rate for any such currency declines after the fund’s income has been earned and converted into us dollars but before payment to shareholders the fund could be required to liquidate portfolio investments to make such distributions similarly if the fund incurs an expense in us dollars and the exchange rate declines before the expense is paid the fund would have to convert a greater amount to us dollars to pay for the expense at that time than it would have had to convert at the time the fund incurred the expense investments in other pooled investment vehicles direct or indirect investing in another pooled investment vehicle such as securitization vehicles that issue assetbacked securities exposes the fund to all of the risks of that vehicle’s investments the fund will bear its pro rata share of the expenses of any such vehicle in addition to its own expenses the values of other pooled    investment vehicles are subject to change as the values of their respective component assets fluctuate to the extent the fund invests in managed pooled investment vehicles the performance of the fund’s investments in such vehicles will be dependent upon the investment and research abilities of persons other than the adviser the securities offered by such vehicles typically are not registered under the securities laws because they are offered in transactions that are exempt from registration market risk the value of the fund’s investments may decline sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to general economic conditions that are not specifically related to a particular issuer or borrower such as real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions throughout the world changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally the value of the fund’s investments also may decline because of factors that affect a particular industry or industries for example the financial crisis that began in  caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities these risks may be particularly acute for the fund as alternative lending is a new and evolving industry volatility risk the market value of the alternative lendingrelated securities to which the fund has exposure may increase or decrease sometimes rapidly and unpredictably based upon changes in an issuer’s financial condition andor overall market and economic conditions because many of the fund’s investments may be illiquid andor below investment grade or unrated but of a similar quality debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds” the fund may be subject to increased volatility risk in addition the fund’s use of leverage will increase the volatility of the fund’s value management and operational risk the fund is subject to management risk because it relies on the adviser’s ability to achieve its investment objective the fund runs the risk that the adviser’s investment techniques will fail to produce desired results and cause the fund to incur significant losses the adviser may fail to use derivatives effectively may select investments that do not perform as anticipated by the adviser and may choose to hedge or not to hedge positions at disadvantageous times any imperfections errors or limitations in quantitative analyses and models used by the adviser as part of its investment process could affect the fund’s performance models that appear to explain prior market data can fail to predict future market events further the data used in models may be inaccurate or may not include the most recent information about a company or a security the fund also is subject to the risk of loss as a result of other services provided by the adviser and other service providers including pricing administrative accounting tax legal custody transfer agency and other services operational risk includes the possibility of loss caused by inadequate procedures and controls human error and cyber attacks disruptions and failures affecting or by a service provider for example trading delays or errors both human and systematic could prevent the fund from benefiting from potential investment gains or avoiding losses alternative lending operational and technology risk alternative lendingrelated securities are typically originated and documented in electronic form and there are ordinarily no tangible written documents evidencing such loans or any payments owed thereon because the fund depends on electronic systems maintained by the custodian and the platforms or their affiliates to maintain records evidence ownership of the fund’s investments appropriately safeguard such investments and to service and administer alternative lendingrelated securities as applicable the fund is vulnerable to the risks associated with such electronic systems including among others power loss computer systems failures and internet telecommunications or data network failures operator negligence or improper operation by or supervision of    employees physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches misappropriation and similar events computer viruses cyber attacks intentional acts of vandalism and similar events and hurricanes fires floods and other natural disasters in addition platforms rely on software that is highly technical and complex and depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data such software may contain errors or flaws some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors or other design defects within the software on which a platform relies may result in a negative experience for borrowers who use the platform delay introductions of new features or enhancements result in errors or compromise the platform’s ability to protect borrower or investor data or its own intellectual property any errors flaws or defects discovered in the software on which a platform relies could negatively impact operations of the platform and the ability of the platform to perform its obligations with respect to the loans associated with the platform the electronic systems on which platforms rely may be subject to cyber attacks that could result among other things in data breaches and the release of confidential information and thus expose the platform to significant liability a security breach could also irreparably damage a platform’s reputation and thus its ability to continue to operate its business in addition despite any security measures established to safeguard the information in these systems the highly automated nature of a platform or other service providers involved in the alternative lending process may make it an attractive target and potentially more vulnerable to cyber attacks computer viruses physical or electronic breakins employee error malfeasance and similar disruptions which could negatively affect the fund if a platform or other service provider were unable to prevent such malicious activity the breach could compromise the systems and result in the theft loss or public dissemination of the information stored therein as a result the platform or other service provider could suffer among other things financial loss the disruption of its business liability to third parties regulatory intervention or reputational damage and the platform’s or other service provider’s ability to fulfill its servicing or other obligations would be adversely affected which may adversely effect the fund because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target the platforms or other service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition certain legal or regulatory provisions may require companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data if security measures are breached because of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise or if design flaws in software are exposed and exploited relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged any failure of the systems technology on which the fund relies or other similar issues could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the fund to acquire monitor or otherwise transact in alternative lendingrelated securities and therefore may impact the performance of the fund all of these potential risks may cause a decrease in the amount of loans acquired by the platforms which may directly affect the fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective the potential for security breaches may also adversely affect the fund due to its reputational impact on the platforms and wider effect on the alternative lending industry as a whole any of the foregoing failures or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the fund equity investment risk equities fluctuate in price and their shortterm volatility at times may be great to the extent that the fund obtains exposure to equity securities the value of the fund’s portfolio will be affected by changes in the stock markets market risk can affect the fund’s net asset value per share which will fluctuate as the values of the fund’s portfolio securities change the prices of individual equity securities do not all move in the same direction uniformly or at the same time different stock markets may behave differently from one another    small and midcapitalization investing risk the fund may gain exposure to the securities of small capitalization companies midcapitalization companies recently organized companies and derivative instruments related to those securities for example the fund may invest in equity or debt securities of companies in or related to the alternative lending industry or may gain exposure to the borrowings of such issuers facilitated through an alternative lending platform historically such securities and particularly securities of smaller capitalization companies have been more volatile in price than those of larger capitalized more established companies many of the risks that apply to small capitalization companies apply equally to midcapitalization companies and such companies are included in the term “small capitalization companies” for the purposes of this risk factor the securities of small capitalization and recently organized companies pose greater investment risks because such companies may have limited product lines distribution channels and financial and managerial resources in particular small capitalization companies may be operating at a loss or have significant variations in operating results may be engaged in a rapidly changing business with products subject to substantial risk of obsolescence may require substantial additional capital to support their operations to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position and may have substantial borrowings or may otherwise have a weak financial condition in addition these companies may face intense competition including competition from companies with greater financial resources more extensive development manufacturing marketing and other capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel the equity securities of alternative lending platforms or other issuers in this industry that are small capitalization companies are often traded over the counter or on regional exchanges and may not be traded in the volumes typical on a national securities exchange consequently the fund or entities in which the fund obtains exposure may be required to dispose of such securities or remain in a short position over a longer and potentially less favorable period of time than is required to dispose of or close out of a short position with respect to the securities of larger more established companies investments in equity or debt instruments issued by small capitalization companies may also be more difficult to value than other types of securities because of the foregoing considerations as well as if applicable lower trading volumes investments in companies with limited or no operating histories are more speculative and entail greater risk than do investments in companies with an established operating record derivatives risk the fund may invest directly or indirectly in a variety of derivatives including futures contracts forwards swaps and other exchangetraded and overthecounter otc derivatives contracts derivatives are financial contracts the value of which depends on or is derived from an asset or other underlying reference derivatives involve the risk that changes in their value may not move as expected relative to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset they are designed to track the fund may invest in derivatives for investment purposes and for hedging and risk management purposes see the statement of additional information for additional information of the various types and uses of derivatives in the fund’s strategy the use of derivatives involves risks that are in addition to and potentially greater than the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets in particular the fund’s use of otc derivatives exposes it to the risk that the counterparties will be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor their obligations an otc derivatives contract typically can be closed only with the consent of the other party to the contract if the counterparty defaults the fund will still have contractual remedies but may not be able to enforce them because the contract for each otc derivative is individually negotiated the counterparty may interpret contractual terms differently than the fund and if it does the fund may decide not to pursue its claims against the counterparty to avoid incurring the cost and unpredictability of legal proceedings the fund therefore may be unable to obtain payments the adviser believes are owed to it under otc derivatives contracts or those payments may be delayed or made only after the fund has incurred the costs of litigation the fund may invest in derivatives that i do not require the counterparty to post collateral eg foreign currency forwards ii require collateral but that do not provide for the fund’s security interest in it to be perfected iii require a significant upfront deposit by the fund unrelated to the derivative’s intrinsic value or    iv do not require that collateral be regularly markedtomarket when a counterparty’s obligations are not fully secured by collateral the fund runs the risk of having limited recourse if the counterparty defaults even when obligations are required by contract to be collateralized the fund often will not receive the collateral the day the collateral is required to be posted the fund may invest in derivatives with a limited number of counterparties and events affecting the creditworthiness of any of those counterparties may have a pronounced effect on the fund during periods of market disruptions or stress the fund may have a greater need for cash to provide collateral for large swings in its marktomarket obligations under the derivatives in which it has invested derivatives also present other risks described herein including market risk illiquidity risk currency risk and credit risk many derivatives in particular otc derivatives are complex and their valuation often requires modeling and judgment which increases the risk of mispricing or improper valuation the pricing models used may not produce valuations that are consistent with the values the fund realizes when it closes or sells an otc derivative valuation risk is more pronounced when the fund enters into otc derivatives with specialized terms because the value of those derivatives in some cases is determined only by reference to similar derivatives with more standardized terms as a result incorrect valuations may result in increased cash payments to counterparties undercollateralization andor errors in the calculation of the fund’s nav the fund’s use of derivatives may not be effective or have the desired results moreover suitable derivatives will not be available in all circumstances the adviser may decide not to use derivatives to hedge or otherwise reduce the fund’s risk exposures potentially resulting in losses for the fund swap contracts and other otc derivatives are highly susceptible to illiquidity risk see “illiquidity risk” because many derivatives have a leverage component ie a notional value in excess of the assets needed to establish andor maintain the derivative position adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying reference asset may result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself see “leverage risk” there is little case or other law interpreting the terms of most derivatives or characterizing their tax treatment the fund’s use of derivatives may be subject to special tax rules and could generate additional taxable income for shareholders see “distributions and federal income tax matters” below futures risk a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract there can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the futures and in the underlying reference asset positions covering them futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit the daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when the fund seeks to close out a futures contract and the fund would remain obligated to meet margin requirements until the position is closed forwards risk forward contracts are subject to some of the same risks as futures described above however forwards are not traded on exchanges and are not standardized rather banks and dealers act as principals in these markets negotiating each transaction on an individual basis trading in forward contracts is generally unregulated there is no limitation on the daily price movements of forward contracts principals in the forward markets have no obligation to continue to make markets in the forward contracts traded there have been periods during which certain banks or dealers have refused to quote prices for forward contracts or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which they are prepared to buy and that at which they are prepared to sell disruptions can occur    in the forward markets because of unusually high trading volume political intervention or other factors for example the imposition of credit controls by governmental authorities might limit forward trading to the possible detriment of the fund swaps risk the use of swaps involves investment techniques and risks that are different from those associated with portfolio security transactions these instruments typically are not traded on exchanges under recently adopted rules and regulations however transactions in some types of swaps including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps on north american and european indices are required to be centrally cleared “cleared swaps” for otc swaps there is a risk that the other party to certain of these instruments will not perform its obligations to the fund or that the fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it wishes to do so such occurrences could result in losses to the fund for cleared swaps the fund’s counterparty is a clearinghouse rather than a bank or broker since the fund is not a member of the clearinghouses and only members of a clearinghouse “clearing members” can participate directly in the clearinghouse the fund holds cleared swaps through accounts at clearing members in cleared swaps the fund makes payments including margin payments to and receives payments from a clearinghouse through its account at clearing members clearing members guarantee performance of their clients’ obligations to the clearinghouse in some ways cleared swap arrangements are less favorable to mutual funds than bilateral arrangements for example the fund may be required to provide more margin for cleared swaps positions than for bilateral derivatives positions also in contrast to a bilateral derivatives position following a period of notice to the fund a clearing member generally can require termination of an existing cleared swap position at any time or an increase in margin requirements above the margin that the clearing member required at the beginning of a transaction clearinghouses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing positions or to terminate those positions at any time any increase in margin requirements or termination of existing cleared derivatives positions by the clearing member or the clearinghouse could interfere with the ability of the fund to pursue its investment strategy further any increase in margin requirements by a clearing member could expose the fund to greater credit risk to its clearing member because margin for cleared swaps positions in excess of a clearinghouse’s margin requirements typically is held by the clearing member also the fund is subject to risk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared or that the adviser expects to be cleared and no clearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction on the fund’s behalf in those cases the position might have to be terminated and the fund could lose some or all of the benefit of the position including loss of an increase in the value of the position and loss of hedging protection in addition the documentation governing the relationship between the fund and clearing members is drafted by the clearing members and generally is less favorable to the fund than typical bilateral derivatives documentation these and other new rules and regulations could among other things further restrict the fund’s ability to engage in or increase the cost to the fund of derivatives transactions for example by making some types of derivatives no longer available to the fund increasing margin or capital requirements or otherwise limiting liquidity or increasing transaction costs these rules and regulations are new and evolving so their potential impact on the fund and the financial system is not yet known while the new rules and regulations and central clearing of some derivatives transactions are designed to reduce systemic risk ie the risk that the interdependence of large derivatives dealers could cause them to suffer liquidity solvency or other challenges simultaneously there is no assurance that they will achieve that result and in the meantime as noted above central clearing and related requirements expose the fund to new kinds of costs and risks swap agreements may be subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and termination and they may have terms of greater than seven days the fund’s obligations under a swap agreement will be accrued daily offset against any amounts owed to the fund under the swap    subsidiary risk by investing through its subsidiaries the fund is exposed to the risks associated with the subsidiaries’ investments subsidiaries will not be registered as investment companies under the  act and will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the  act although each subsidiary will be managed pursuant to the compliance policies and procedures of the fund applicable to it changes in the laws of the united states andor the jurisdiction in which a subsidiary is organized could result in the inability of the fund andor the subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and could adversely affect the fund short sale risk short sales are transactions in which the fund sells directly or indirectly an asset it does not own to a third party by paying a premium to borrow the asset in anticipation of purchasing the same asset at the market price on a later date to close out the short position the fund may incur a loss if the market price of the asset underlying the short sale increases between the date of the short sale and the date on which the fund must replace the borrowed asset or otherwise close out the transaction and such loss may exceed the initial investment under adverse market conditions the fund may have difficulty purchasing an asset to meet its short sale delivery obligations and may have to sell portfolio assets to raise sufficient capital to fulfill its short sale obligations at a disadvantageous time entering into short sales where the fund does not own the underlying asset creates a form of investment leverage which can magnify the fund’s exposure to changes in the value of the asset because the fund may enter into short sales with respect to assets that it does not already own the loss to the fund from a short sale is theoretically unlimited as the potential increase in the market price of the asset is unlimited the amount of any gain will be decreased and the amount of any loss increased by the amount of the premium dividends interest or expenses the fund may be required to pay in connection with a short sale there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to close out a short sales position at an advantageous time or price to the extent that the fund enters into short sales for hedging purposes there can be no guarantee that the investment will be effective any lack of correlation between the assets used in the short position and the exposure the fund sought to hedge could result in losses small and midcapitalization investing risk the fund may gain exposure to the securities of small capitalization companies midcapitalization companies recently organized companies and derivative instruments related to those securities for example the fund may invest in equity or debt securities of companies in or related to the alternative lending industry or may gain exposure to the borrowings of such issuers facilitated through an alternative lending platform

debt instruments issued    by small capitalization companies may also be more difficult to value than other types of securities because of the foregoing considerations as well as if applicable lower trading volumes investments in companies with limited or no operating histories are more speculative and entail greater risk than do investments in companies with an established operating record tax risk the fund intends to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code in order to qualify for such treatment the fund must derive at least  of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income meet certain asset diversification tests at the end of each fiscal quarter and distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a ric the tax treatment of certain of the fund’s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to rics is not certain an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment if in any year the fund were to fail to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code for any reason and were not able to cure such failure the fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income nondiversification risk the fund is classified as a “nondiversified” fund under the  act accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a “diversified” fund to the extent that the fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer the fund is subject to a higher degree of risk associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a fund that invests more widely repurchase offers risk as described under “periodic repurchase offers” below the fund is an “interval fund” and in order to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund subject to applicable law will conduct quarterly repurchase offers of the fund’s outstanding shares at nav per quarter subject to approval of the board in all cases such repurchases will be for at least  and not more than  and are currently expected to be for  of its outstanding shares at nav pursuant to rule c under the  act the fund believes that these repurchase offers are generally beneficial to the fund’s shareholders and repurchases generally will be funded from available cash or sales of portfolio securities which are substantially illiquid however repurchase offers and the need to fund repurchase obligations may affect the ability of the fund to be fully invested or force the fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets in liquid investments which may harm the fund’s investment performance moreover diminution in the size of the fund through repurchases may result in untimely sales of portfolio securities with associated imputed transaction costs which may be significant and may limit the ability of the fund to participate in new investment opportunities or to achieve its investment objective in compliance with its procedures the fund will to the extent possible hold at least  of net assets in cash or other liquid assets at all times in order to meet its repurchase obligations the fund may accumulate cash by holding back ie not reinvesting payments received in connection with the fund’s investments the fund believes that payments received in connection with the fund’s investments will generate sufficient cash to meet the maximum potential amount of the fund’s repurchase obligations if at any time cash and other liquid assets held by the fund are not sufficient to meet the fund’s repurchase obligations the fund intends if necessary to sell investments although the fund’s investments are illiquid and the secondary market for its investments is limited the fund believes that it would be able to find willing buyers for investments if such sales were ever necessary to supplement such cash generated by payments received in connection with the fund’s investments if the fund employed investment leverage repurchases of shares would compound the adverse effects of leverage in a declining market in addition if the fund borrows to finance repurchases interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares by increasing the fund’s expenses and reducing any net investment    income if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed the fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request as a result shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the fund during a particular repurchase offer some shareholders in anticipation of proration may tender more shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter thereby increasing the likelihood that proration will occur a shareholder may be subject to market and other risks and the nav of shares tendered in a repurchase offer may decline between the repurchase request deadline and the date on which the nav for tendered shares is determined in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund may be a taxable event to shareholders portfolio turnover a change in the securities held by the fund is known as “portfolio turnover” if the fund realizes capital gains when it sells investments it generally must pay those gains to shareholders increasing its taxable distributions including distributions of shortterm capital gain which are taxable as ordinary income to shareholders increased portfolio turnover may also result in higher brokerage fees or other transaction costs which can reduce the fund’s performance portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities temporary defensive and interim investments for temporary defensive purposes in times of adverse or unstable market economic or political conditions the fund can invest up to  of its assets in investments that may be inconsistent with its principal investment strategies generally the fund would invest in money market instruments or in other shortterm us or nonus government securities the fund might also hold these types of securities as interim investments pending the investment of proceeds from the sale of its shares or the sale of its portfolio securities or to meet anticipated redemptions of its shares to the extent the fund invests in these securities it might not achieve its investment objective expense risk your actual costs of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in “annual fund operating expenses” for a variety of reasons for example expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease the fund’s expense limitation agreements which generally remain in effect for a period of one year mitigate this risk however there is no assurance that the adviser will renew such expense limitation agreements from yeartoyear reporting requirements shareholders who beneficially own shares that constitute more than  of the fund’s shares are subject to certain requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and the rules promulgated thereunder these include requirements to file certain reports with the sec eg reports pursuant to section  of the exchange act the fund has no obligation to file such reports on behalf of such shareholders or to notify shareholders that such reports are required to be made shareholders who may be subject to such requirements should consult with their legal advisors antitakeover provisions the fund’s declaration of trust together with any amendments thereto includes provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the fund or convert the fund to openend status no prior

will initially cap its total assets at  billion an “initial cap” once the initial cap is met the fund will no longer accept new investors and only the reinvestment of dividends by existing investors will be permitted following the initial launch the fund may reopen to new investors and may subsequently close again at any time at the discretion of the adviser irrespective of the initial cap amount in addition upon commencement of investment operations the fund will be made available for investment on a priority basis to a group of investors the “consortium” who have participated in educational sessions regarding the fund and the asset class in which it invests if capacity allows once orders are fulfilled for the consortium the fund will then be available for investment by other investors the fund may also prioritize and allocate    capacity to the consortium upon any subsequent reopening of the fund the consortium members do not have any special rights to offering price dividends or liquidation the consortium is expected to consist of a selected group of registered investment advisers who have discretionary authority to invest on their clients’ behalf and a fiduciary duty to their clients and with whom the adviser has a previous relationship members of the consortium and their clients are not obligated to invest in the fund periodic repurchase offers the fund is a closedend interval fund and to provide liquidity and the ability to receive nav on a disposition of at least a portion of your shares makes periodic offers to repurchase shares except as permitted by the fund’s interval structure no shareholder will have the right to require the fund to repurchase its shares no public market for shares exists and none is expected to develop in the future consequently shareholders generally will not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of their shares by the fund the fund has adopted pursuant to rule c under the  act a fundamental policy which cannot be changed without shareholder approval requiring the fund to offer to repurchase at least  and up to  of its shares at nav on a regular schedule although the policy permits repurchases of between  and  of the fund’s outstanding shares for each quarterly repurchase offer the fund currently expect to offer to repurchase  of the fund’s outstanding shares at nav subject to approval of the board the schedule requires the fund to make repurchase offers every three months the fund expects the first repurchase offer to be issued in november  repurchase dates the fund will make quarterly repurchase offers in the months of february may august and november as discussed below the date on which the repurchase price for shares is determined will be generally on or about the th day of the following month but shall occur no later than the th day after the repurchase request deadline or the next business day if the th day is not a business day repurchase request deadline the date by which shareholders wishing to tender shares for repurchase must respond to the repurchase offer typically falls approximately seven days before the repurchase pricing date defined below when a repurchase offer commences the fund sends at least  days before the repurchase request deadline written notice to each shareholder setting forth among other things     •   the percentage of outstanding shares that the fund is offering to repurchase and how the fund will purchase shares on a pro rata basis if the offer is oversubscribed     •   the date on which a shareholder’s repurchase request is due the repurchase deadline     •   the date that will be used to determine the fund’s nav applicable to the repurchase offer the “repurchase pricing date” see “repurchase dates” above     •   the date by which the fund will pay to shareholders the proceeds from their shares accepted for repurchase     •   the nav of the shares as of a date no more than seven days before the date of the written notice and the means by which shareholders may ascertain the nav     •   the procedures by which shareholders may tender their shares and the right of shareholders to withdraw or modify their tenders before the repurchase request deadline     •   the circumstances in which the fund may suspend or postpone the repurchase offer    this notice may be included in a shareholder report or other fund document the repurchase request deadline will be strictly observed if a shareholder fails to submit a repurchase request in good order by the repurchase request deadline the shareholder will be unable to liquidate shares until a subsequent repurchase offer and will have to resubmit a request in the next repurchase offer shareholders may withdraw or change a repurchase request with a proper instruction submitted in good form at any point before the repurchase request deadline determination of repurchase price and payment for shares the date on which the repurchase price for shares is determined will be generally on or about the th day of the month that follows the repurchase offer the “repurchase pricing date” but shall occur no later than the th day after the repurchase request deadline or the next business day if the th day is not a business day the fund expects to distribute payment to shareholders between one and three business days after the repurchase pricing date and will distribute such payment no later than seven  calendar days after such date the fund’s nav per share may change materially between the date a repurchase offer is mailed and the repurchase request deadline and it may also change materially between the repurchase request deadline and repurchase pricing date the method by which the fund calculates nav is discussed below under “determination of net asset value” during the period an offer to repurchase is open shareholders may obtain the current nav by calling the fund’s transfer agent at   the fund does not currently charge a repurchase fee suspension or postponement of repurchase offers the fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer in limited circumstances set forth in rule c under the  act as described below but only with the approval of a majority of the trustees including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined in the  act the fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer only  if making or effecting the repurchase offer would cause the fund to lose its status as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code  for any period during which the new york stock exchange “nyse” or any other market in which the securities owned by the fund are principally traded is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or during which trading in such market is restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal by the fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable or during which it is not reasonably practicable for the fund fairly to determine the value of its net assets or  for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of the fund oversubscribed repurchase offers there is no minimum number of shares that must be tendered before the fund will honor repurchase requests however the fund’s trustees set for each repurchase offer a maximum percentage of shares that may be repurchased by the fund in the event a repurchase offer by the fund is oversubscribed the fund may repurchase but is not required to repurchase additional shares up to a maximum amount of  of the outstanding shares of the fund if the fund determines not to repurchase additional shares beyond the repurchase offer amount or if shareholders tender an amount of shares greater than that which the fund is entitled to repurchase the fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis the fund does not currently expect to offer to repurchase additional shares in the event a repurchase offer is oversubscribed if any shares that you wish to tender to the fund are not repurchased because of proration you will have to wait until the next repurchase offer and resubmit a new repurchase request and your repurchase request will not be given any priority over other shareholders’ requests thus there is a risk that the fund may not purchase all of the shares you wish to have repurchased in a given repurchase offer or in any subsequent repurchase offer in anticipation of the possibility of proration some shareholders may tender more shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter increasing the likelihood of proration    there is no assurance that you will be able to tender your shares when or in the amount that you desire consequences of repurchase offers from the time the fund distributes or publishes each repurchase offer notification until the repurchase pricing date for that offer the fund must maintain liquid assets at least equal to the percentage of its shares subject to the repurchase offer for this purpose “liquid assets” means assets that may be sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the price at which the fund values them within the period between the repurchase request deadline and the repurchase payment deadline or which mature by the repurchase payment deadline the fund will to the extent possible hold at least  of net assets in cash or other liquid assets at all times in order to meet its repurchase obligations the fund is also permitted to borrow up to the maximum extent permitted under the  act to meet repurchase requests if the fund borrows to finance repurchases interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares by increasing the fund’s expenses and reducing any net investment income there is no assurance that the fund will be able sell a significant amount of additional shares so as to mitigate these effects these and other possible risks associated with the fund’s repurchase offers are described under “principal risks of investment in the fund — repurchase offers risk” above in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund will be a taxable event to shareholders potentially even to those shareholders that do not participate in the repurchase for a discussion of these tax consequences see “distributions and federal income tax matters” below and “tax status” in the statement of additional information services agreement the fund has entered into a “services agreement” with the adviser pursuant to which the fund has appointed the adviser as “servicing agent” to compensate financial industry professionals for providing ongoing services in respect of clients with whom they have distributed shares of the fund these financial industry professionals may provide varying investment products programs platforms and accounts through which investors may purchase redeem and exchange shares of the fund shareholder servicing arrangements may include electronic processing of client orders electronic fund transfers between clients and the fund account reconciliations with the fund’s transfer agent facilitation of electronic delivery to clients of fund documentation monitoring client accounts for backup withholding and any other special tax reporting obligations maintenance of books and records with respect to the foregoing and such other information and liaison services as the fund or the adviser may reasonably request under the services agreement the fund pays the adviser quarterly in arrears an investor services fee computed at an annual rate of  of the average daily net assets of the fund computed on a monthly basis payments to financial firms the fund or the adviser also may enter into agreements with certain intermediaries under which the fund makes payments to the intermediaries in recognition of the avoided transfer agency costs to the fund associated with the intermediaries’ maintenance of customer accounts or in recognition of the services provided by intermediaries through fund platforms payments made by the fund or the adviser under such agreements are generally based on either  a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the customer shares serviced by the intermediary up to a set maximum or  a per account fee assessed against each account serviced by such intermediary up to a set maximum these payments are in addition to other payments described in this prospectus such as the services agreement investors who invest through financial firms are subject to the eligibility requirements set out herein determination of net asset value the nav of the fund’s shares is determined by dividing the total value of the fund’s portfolio investments plus cash and other assets less any liabilities including accrued expenses or dividends by the total number of shares    outstanding the fund’s shares are valued as of a particular time the “valuation time” on each day that the nyse opens for business the valuation time is ordinarily at the close of regular trading on the nyse normally  pm eastern time current net asset values per share of the fund may be obtained by contacting the transfer agent by telephone at   the board has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund will value its investments in accordance with these procedures the fund’s investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value market values for various types of securities and other instruments are determined on the basis of closing prices or last sale prices on an exchange or other market or based on quotes or other market information obtained from quotation reporting systems established market makers brokers data delivery vendors or pricing services to the extent the fund invests in openend management companies that are registered under the  act the fund’s nav will be calculated based upon the net asset value of such funds the prospectuses for such funds explain the circumstances under which they will use fair value pricing and its effects please see “computation of net asset value” in the statement of additional information for more information shortterm debt securities which have a maturity date of  days or less are valued at amortized cost if market quotations are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or infrequent the fund’s investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the board “fair value pricing” in these circumstances the fund determines fair value in a manner that seeks to reflect the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate as further described below pursuant to the fund’s policies and procedures most of the fund’s holdings in alternative lendingrelated securities are fair valued based on prices provided by a thirdparty pricing service the fund accounts for whole and fractional loans at the individual loan level for valuation purposes and whole loans are fair valued using inputs that take into account borrowerlevel data eg payment history that is updated periodically as often as the nav is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or loan the valuation committee the “committee” comprised of officers of the adviser and established pursuant to the policies and procedures adopted by the board has the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the fund’s valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board for purposes of determining the fair value of securities the committee may consider without limitation i indications or quotes from brokers ii valuations provided by a thirdparty pricing agent iii internal models that take into consideration different factors determined to be relevant by the adviser or iv any combination of the above fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of an asset or liability the values of the funds’ investments in publicly traded foreign equity securities generally will be determined by a pricing service using pricing models designed to estimate likely changes in the values of those securities between the times in which the trading in those securities is substantially completed and the close of the nyse fair values used to determine the fund’s navs may differ from quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets or liabilities held by the fund it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security thus fair valuation may have an unintended dilutive or accretive effect on the value of shareholders’ investments in the fund information that becomes known to the funds or their agents after the nav has been calculated on a particular day will not be used to retroactively adjust the price of a security or the nav determined earlier that day it is expected that a substantial portion of the fund’s investments will be us dollar denominated investments investments initially valued in currencies other than the us dollar are converted to us dollars using exchange     the nyse is open from monday through friday  am to  pm eastern time nyse nyse arca nyse bonds and nyse arca options markets will generally close on and in observation of the following holidays new year’s day martin luther king jr day washington’s birthday good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day    rates obtained from pricing services as a result the nav of the fund’s shares may be affected by changes in the value of currencies in relation to the us dollar international markets are sometimes open on days when us markets are closed which means that the value of foreign securities owned by the fund could change on days when fund shares cannot be bought or sold the value of investments traded in markets outside the us or denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may be affected significantly on a day that the nyse is closed and the nav of the fund’s shares may change on days when an investor is not able to purchase redeem or exchange shares the calculation of the fund’s nav may not take place contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of foreign securities used in nav calculations distributions and federal income tax matters it is the fund’s policy to make distributions at least annually of all or substantially all of its net investment income and net realized capital gains if any unless you elect to receive your distributions in cash your ordinary income and capital gain distributions will be reinvested in additional shares of the same share class of the fund at the nav calculated as of the payment date the fund will pay distributions on a pershare basis as a result on the exdividend date of such a payment the nav of the fund will be reduced by the amount of the payment this section summarizes some of the important us federal income tax consequences of investing in the fund this discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may apply to shareholders or to specific types of shareholders such as taxdeferred retirement plans and persons who are not “us persons” within the meaning of the code you should consult your tax adviser for information concerning the possible application of federal state local or nonus tax laws to you please see the statement of additional information for additional information regarding the tax aspects of investing in the fund the fund intends to elect to be treated and to qualify and be treated each year as a “regulated investment company” “ric” under subchapter m of chapter  of the internal review code of  as amended the “code” to qualify for treatment as a ric the fund must meet certain income asset diversification and distribution requirements the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company the tax treatment of certain of the fund’s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to rics is not certain an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment failure of the fund to qualify and be eligible to be treated as a ric would result in fundlevel taxation and consequently a reduced return on your investment the fund could in some cases cure such failure including by paying a fundlevel tax or interest making additional distributions or disposing of certain assets the fund may invest in one or more whollyowned subsidiaries it is currently expected that any such subsidiary will be a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes in the case of a subsidiary that is a disregarded entity for such purposes i the fund is treated as owning the subsidiary’s assets directly ii any income gain loss deduction or other tax items arising in respect of the subsidiary’s assets will be treated as if they are realized or incurred as applicable directly by the fund and ii any distributions the fund receives from the subsidiary will have no effect on the fund’s us federal income tax liability the tax treatment of the fund’s investments in the securities of special purpose entities that acquire and hold alternative lendingrelated securities will depend on the terms of such investments and may affect the amount timing or character of income recognized by the fund the fund’s investment in foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding or other taxes which may decrease the fund’s yield on those securities in addition the fund’s investments in debt instruments foreign securities foreign currencies and options and other derivatives may increase or accelerate the fund’s recognition of income or gain and may affect the timing amount or character of the fund’s distributions    for federal income tax purposes distributions of net investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary income the tax treatment of fund distributions of capital gains is determined by how long the fund owned or is deemed to have owned the investments that generated them rather than how long you owned your shares distributions of net capital gains the excess of the fund’s net longterm capital gains over its net shortterm capital losses that are properly reported by the fund as capital gain dividends “capital gain dividends” will be taxable as longterm capital gains which are taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates distributions of net gains from the sale or deemed disposition of investments that the fund held or is treated as having held for one year or less will be taxable as ordinary income distributions of investment income properly reported by the fund as derived from “qualified dividend income” if any will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to longterm capital gains provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met at both the shareholder and fund level if in and with respect to any taxable year the fund makes a distribution to a shareholder in excess of the fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits the excess distribution will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in its shares and thereafter as capital gain a return of capital is not taxable but it reduces a shareholder’s tax basis in its shares thus reducing any loss or increasing any gain on a subsequent taxable disposition by the shareholder of its shares a  medicare contribution tax is imposed on the “net investment income” of certain individuals estates and trusts to the extent their income exceeds certain threshold amounts “net investment income” generally includes dividends interest and net gains from the disposition of investment property including the fund’s ordinary income dividends capital gain dividends and capital gains recognized on the sale repurchase or exchange of fund shares shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect if any that this provision may have on their investment in fund shares a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by the fund in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by the fund during january of the following calendar year distributions are taxable to you even if they are paid from income or gains earned by the fund prior to your investment and thus were included in the price you paid for your shares for example if you purchase shares on or just before the record date of a fund distribution you will pay full price for the shares and could receive a portion of your investment back as a taxable distribution in general you will be taxed on the distributions you receive from the fund whether you receive them as additional shares or in cash any gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of your shares in the fund generally will be treated as a capital gain or loss for federal income tax purposes which will be longterm or shortterm depending on how long you have held your shares shareholders who offer all of the shares they hold or are deemed to hold in response to a periodic repurchase offer see “periodic repurchase offers” above generally will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will recognize a capital gain or loss if a shareholder tenders fewer than all of its common shares it is possible that any amounts that the shareholder receives in such repurchase will be taxable as a dividend to such shareholder and there is a risk that shareholders who do not tender any of their shares for repurchase will be treated as having received a dividend distribution as a result of their proportionate increase in the ownership of the fund the fund’s use of cash to repurchase shares could adversely affect its ability to satisfy the distribution requirements for treatment as a ric the fund could also recognize income in connection with its liquidation of portfolio securities to fund share repurchases any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements are satisfied in general dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by the fund to a person who is not a “us person” within the meaning of the code a “foreign shareholder” are subject to withholding of us federal    income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate however the code provides a withholding tax exemption if the fund so elects for certain interestrelated dividends and shortterm capital gain dividends paid to foreign shareholders sections  of the code and the us treasury regulations and irs guidance issued thereunder collectively “fatca” generally require the fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its shareholders under fatca or under an applicable intergovernmental agreement an “iga” if a shareholder fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply with fatca or an iga the fund or its agent may be required to withhold under fatca  of the dividends it pays and on or after january   which date under recent treasury guidance is expected to be delayed until on or after january    of the gross proceeds of share repurchases and certain capital gain dividends it pays if a payment by the fund is subject to fatca withholding the fund or its agent is required to withhold even if the payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under rules applicable to nonus shareholders eg capital gain dividends each prospective shareholder is urged to consult its tax adviser regarding the applicability of fatca and any other reporting requirements in addition foreign countries are considering and may implement laws similar in purpose and scope to fatca as more fully described above the discussion above is very general please consult your tax adviser about the effect that an investment in the fund could have on your own tax situation including possible foreign federal state or local tax consequences or about any other tax questions you may have dividend reinvestment plan dividends and capital gains distributions are automatically reinvested unless otherwise noted you may notify the transfer agent in writing to     •   choose to receive dividends or distributions or both in cash or     •   change the way you currently receive distributions shares may be distributed in lieu of cash the number of shares that will be distributed in lieu of cash is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the distribution to be reinvested by the nav as of the close of business on the day of the distribution your taxable income is the same regardless of which option you choose for further information about dividend reinvestment contact the transfer agent by telephone at    description of the fund the fund is an investment portfolio of stone ridge trust v the “trust” a statutory trust established under the laws of state of delaware by the

discusses the investment objective of the fund as well as the principal investment strategies it employs to achieve its objective and the principal investment risks associated with those strategies additional information about the strategies and other investment practices the fund may employ and certain related risks of the fund are described below additional information about the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities bankruptcy risk in the event that a platform or thirdparty servicer become subject to a bankruptcy the fund’s investments in the alternative lendingrelated securities serviced by such entity may be negatively impacted although many of the loan servicers may have been organized and operated in a manner that is intended to minimize the likelihood that they will become insolvent if the servicing entity were to become subject to bankruptcy proceedings payments on the corresponding alternative lendingrelated securities could be substantially delayed or reduced and any interest accrued on those obligations may never be paid to investors in the event that a platform becomes subject to bankruptcy the fund’s investments in securities issued by the platform may be negatively impacted if a platform becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings the fund can expect to realize on any investments only to the extent that the platform’s creditors are made whole and the platform still has residual profits that would benefit investors in the event that a borrower becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding the fund’s investments in any loan that is an unsecured obligation of the borrower may be negatively impacted if a borrower enters bankruptcy an automatic stay of all proceedings against the borrower’s property will typically be granted this stay will prevent the platform or thirdparty servicer from foreclosing on such property unless relief from the stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court and there is no guarantee that any such relief will be obtained the fund may incur significant legal fees and costs in attempting to obtain relief from a bankruptcy stay from the bankruptcy court and even if such relief is ultimately granted it may take several months or more to obtain in addition bankruptcy courts have broad powers to permit the sale of any real property free of any lien that a loan servicer may have to compel the servicer to accept an amount less than the balance due under a loan and to permit the borrower to repay the loan over a term which may be substantially longer than the original term of the loan all of which could negatively impact the value of the fund’s investments chargeback risk because the fund expects to receive payments received by the loan servicing agent from borrowers the fund may be affected by “borrower chargebacks” which occur when a borrower who has made a payment on an underlying loan has its bank cancel the payment or request a refund of that payment in the event that a borrower successfully processes a chargeback on a loan payment after proceeds have been distributed to the fund the loan servicing agent will deduct the amount of that payment from the fund’s account with the loan servicing agent and amounts that would otherwise be credited to the fund’s account including amounts deposited or that are payable on other loans are subject to setoff against any such negative cash balance distressed and defaulted instruments or special situations investments risks the fund may invest directly or indirectly in securities of financially distressed issuers which involve substantial risks the fund may invest in or acquire loans to companies involved in or undergoing workouts liquidations spinoffs reorganizations    bankruptcies or other catalytic changes or similar transactions such investments may include debtorinpossession financing distressed debt may present a substantial risk of default or may be in default at the time the fund invests the fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of principal or interest on its investments in any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to an investment in a financially distressed issuer the fund may lose its entire investment or may be required to accept cash or securities with a value substantially less than its original investment among the risks inherent in investments in a troubled issuer is that it is often difficult to obtain information as to the true financial condition of the issuer the adviser’s judgments about the credit quality of a financially distressed issuer and the relative value of its instruments may prove to be inaccurate further distressed investing gives rise to the risks that the contemplated transaction will be unsuccessful will be considerably drawn out over time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security with a value less than the purchase price of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received similarly if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur the fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss or if there is no secondary market for such investment may be required to hold an investment with little or no value when dealing with investments in distressed issuers the fund may also experience other risks including legal difficulties and negotiations with creditors and other claimants because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving the financially troubled issuers in which the fund may invest there is a potential risk of loss by the fund of its entire investment in such issuers financial institutions and government regulation the collapse of various large financial institutions and investment funds across the globe and widespread related losses have resulted in an ongoing severe liquidity crisis throughout the global credit markets during the last several years sectors of the credit markets continue to experience difficulty including the collateralized mortgagebacked securities and leveraged finance markets along with various other areas of consumer finance the lack of transparency and reliable pricing of assets has resulted in some investors withdrawing from the markets for assetbacked securities and related securities the resulting lack of liquidity has become sufficiently widespread to cause credit issues in areas of the capital markets that have limited exposure to subprime mortgages and has prompted central banks in the united states the european union the united kingdom and elsewhere to take action to attempt to ease these liquidity issues and has also resulted in the united states experiencing a broad and ongoing economic recession delinquencies and losses with respect to certain of these asset types such as auto loans have increased and may continue to increase high unemployment and the continued lack of availability of credit may lead to increased default rates on the collateral underlying many of these securities as a result this may adversely affect the performance and market value of the fund the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” which was signed into law in july  has resulted in significant revisions of the us financial regulatory framework the doddfrank act covers a broad range of topics including among many others a reorganization of federal financial regulators a process designed to ensure financial systematic stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms new rules for derivatives trading the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau the registration and regulation of private funds the regulation of credit rating agencies and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation is not yet certain and issuers in which the fund invests may also be affected by the new legislation and regulation in ways that are currently unforeseeable governments or their agencies also may acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership interests in those institutions the longterm implications of government ownership and disposition of these assets are unclear and may have positive or negative effects on the liquidity valuation and performance of the fund’s portfolio holdings as the alternative lending industry grows governments andor other regulatory bodies both inside and outside the us may impose restrictions on participants in the alternative lending industry including platforms investors such as the fund or others that could adversely impact the fund’s investment performance such restrictions could include regulations limiting the fund’s ability to acquire loans or interests in loans or to collect the stipulated levels of interest on the loans underlying the fund’s alternative lendingrelated investments    real property risks the fund may gain exposure to loans collateralized by real property the value of the real property underlying a loan will be subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of improved and unimproved real estate such as changes in general or local economic conditions increases in interest rates for real estate financing physical damage that is not covered by insurance zoning and entitlements some borrowers may intend to use resale proceeds to repay their loans a decline in property values could result in a loan amount that is greater than the property value which could increase the likelihood of borrower default the payment schedules with respect to many real estaterelated loans are based on projected revenues generated by the property over the term of the loan these projections are based on factors such as expected vacancy rates expense rates and other projected income and expense figures relating to the property the actual revenues generated by a property could fall short of projections due to factors such as lowerthanexpected rental revenues or greaterthanexpected vacancy rates or property management expenses in such cases a borrower may be unable to repay a loan to the extent the fund has exposure to construction or rehabilitation loans it may be adversely impacted by among other things risks involving the timeliness of the project’s completion the integrity of appraisal values whether or not the completed property can be sold for the amount anticipated and the length of the construction andor sale process a borrower’s ability to repay a loan relating to real property might also be adversely affected if toxic environmental contamination were to be discovered to exist on the property a platform or thirdparty servicer could be forced to take on potential additional liabilities and responsibilities in the event of foreclosure environmental contamination may give rise to a diminution in value of the underlying property or may lead to liability for cleanup costs or other remedial actions a platform may choose not to foreclose on a contaminated property as the potential liability could exceed the value of the real property or the principal balance of the related loan the failure to perform the required remedial actions could in some jurisdictions give rise to a lien on mortgaged property to ensure the reimbursement of remedial costs which could decrease the value of the property that serves as collateral the state of law is currently unclear as to whether and under what circumstances cleanup costs or the obligation to take remedial actions can be imposed on a secured lender if a platform does become liable for cleanup costs it may bring an action for contribution against the current owners or operators the owners or operators at the time of onsite disposal activity or any other party who contributed to the environmental hazard but these persons or entities may be bankrupt or otherwise judgmentproof furthermore an action against the borrower may be adversely affected by the limitations on recourse in the loan documents servicer autonomy risk a servicer may be authorized to waive or modify nonmaterial terms of a loan to consent to the postponement of strict compliance with certain nonmaterial terms or to grant a nonmaterial indulgence to a borrower in the event that a loan is in default or the servicer determines that default is reasonably foreseeable the servicer may be permitted to waive or modify a material term of a loan to accept payment of an amount less than the principal balance in final satisfaction of a loan or to grant any indulgence to a borrower provided that the servicer has reasonably determined that such action will not be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of any security interest in such loan servicer resources risk a platform may derive a substantial amount if not all of its revenue from fees generated through making and arranging loans as a result a platform may be incentivized to finance as many projects as possible in order to maximize the amount of origination fees it is able to generate increased project volume increases the demands on a platform’s servicing resources which could impact the platform’s ability to devote adequate attention and resources to servicing loans in the event that a platform takes on loan volumes that exceed its ability to service outstanding loans payments on the fund’s loans may be adversely affected risks related to investments in receivables or invoices the fund may invest in alternative lendingrelated securities with exposure to receivables or invoice financing in making such investments the fund is dependent upon the platforms’ ability to monitor and curtail fraud including factoring fraud which involves the    falsification of invoice documents false invoices can easily be created online to appear as if they have been issued by legitimate debtors or as if the invoiced amounts are higher than they actually are platforms that originate trade receivables financing loans to corporations usually conduct due diligence but do not always conduct onsite visits to verify that the business exists and is in good standing for this reason the risk of fraud may be greater with corporate trade receivables typically a platform will seek to validate that the debtor has received the goods or services for which it has been invoiced and is willing to pay the creditor before making the receivables available for investment although this may not always be the case there can be no assurance however that the debtor will not subsequently dispute the quality or price of the goods or services and withhold payments fraud delays or writeoffs associated with such disputes could directly impact the profitability of the fund’s investments in alternative lendingrelated securities with exposure to trade receivables in the event of insolvency of any debtor owing funds on a receivable that the fund has purchased directly or indirectly the fund may only rank as an unsecured creditor in the case of receivables transferred with recourse when a debtor defaults on its obligations to the purchaser of the receivable such as the fund directly or indirectly the seller of the receivable will become obligated to fulfill any remaining invoice amounts owed to the purchaser in the case of receivables transferred without recourse the fund or other direct owner of the receivable will have no such “backup” obligor in the event of a debtor default in either scenario there is a risk that the party with the payment obligation will fail to make payments timely or at all additional information about the fund’s use of derivatives in addition to the derivatives transactions described in the prospectus the fund may also enter into derivatives contracts with respect to any security or other instrument in which it is permitted to invest or with respect to any related security instrument or index “reference instruments” or “reference securities” the fund may enter into a variety of derivative contracts but typically expects to enter into futures contracts and swaps and may also enter into put and call options or options on futures contracts or other derivatives this universe of investments is subject to change under varying market conditions and as these instruments evolve over time the fund may enter into derivatives contracts with standardized terms and no or few special or unusual components which are generally traded on an exchange as well as derivatives with more complex features such as caps floors knockouts lookbacks or other “exotic” elements singly or in combination which are generally traded over the counter overthecounter “otc” derivatives may be standardized or have customized features and may have limited or no liquidity the fund’s derivatives contracts may be centrally cleared or settled bilaterally directly with a counterparty the fund’s derivatives contracts may be cash or physically settled the derivatives contracts the fund may enter into involve substantial risk derivatives typically allow the fund to seek to increase or decrease the level of risk to which it is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments the fund incurs costs in connection with opening and closing derivatives positions the use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the reference instrument due to failure of a counterparty or due to tax or regulatory constraints derivatives may create economic leverage in the fund which magnifies the fund’s exposure to the reference instrument and magnifies potential losses when derivatives are used to gain or limit exposure to a particular market or market segment their performance may not correlate as expected to the performance of such market thereby causing the fund to fail to achieve its original purpose for using such derivatives a decision as to whether when and how to use derivatives involves the exercise of specialized skill and judgment and a transaction may be unsuccessful in whole or in part because of market behavior unexpected events or the stone ridge asset management’s the “adviser” failure to use derivatives effectively derivative instruments may be difficult to value may be illiquid and may be subject to wide swings in valuation caused by changes in the value of the reference instrument futures the fund may buy and sell a variety of futures contracts that relate to among other things debt securities these are referred to as “interest rate futures” broadlybased securities indices “stock index futures” and “bond index futures” foreign currencies commodities and individual equity securities “single stock    futures” futures are standardized exchangetraded contracts that obligate a purchaser to take delivery and a seller to make delivery of a specific amount of an asset at a specified future date at a specified price a futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract originally was written the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts and options are imperfect correlation liquidity unanticipated market movement and counterparty risk a broadlybased stock index is used as the basis for trading stock index futures they may in some cases be based on equity securities of issuers in a particular industry or group of industries a stock index assigns relative values to the securities included in the index and its value fluctuates in response to the changes in value of the underlying securities a stock index cannot be purchased or sold directly bond index futures are similar contracts based on the future value of the basket of securities that comprise the index these contracts obligate the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash to settle the futures transaction there is no delivery made of the underlying securities to settle the futures obligation either party may also settle the transaction by entering into an offsetting contract an interest rate future obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash or a specified type of debt security to settle the futures transaction either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position similarly a single stock future obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash or a specified equity security to settle the futures transaction either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position single stock futures trade on a very limited number of exchanges with contracts typically not fungible among the exchanges no money is paid or received by the fund on the purchase or sale of a future upon entering into a futures transaction the fund will be required to deposit an initial margin payment with the futures commission merchant the “fcm” initial margin payments will be deposited with the fund’s custodian bank in an account registered in the futures broker’s name however the fcm can gain access to that account only under specified conditions as the future is marked to market that is its value on the fund’s books is changed to reflect changes in its market value subsequent margin payments called variation margin will be paid to or by the fcm daily at any time prior to expiration of the future the fund may elect to close out its position by taking an opposite position at which time a final determination of variation margin is made and any additional cash must be paid by or released to the fund all futures transactions except forward contracts are effected through a clearinghouse associated with the exchange on which the contracts are traded   •   commodity futures contracts the fund may invest in futures contracts on various commodities and options on commodity futures compared to investing in futures contracts generally commodity futures contracts are associated with additional risks including but not limited to the following     ¡    storage in commodity futures markets there are physical storage costs associated with purchasing the underlying commodity the price of a commodity futures contract reflects the storage costs of purchasing the physical commodity including the time value of money invested in the physical commodity the value of a commodity futures contract may also change to the extent that the storage costs for an underlying commodity change while the fund is invested in futures contracts on that commodity     ¡    reinvestment in the commodity futures markets producers of the underlying commodity may decide to hedge the price risk of selling the commodity by selling futures contracts to lock in the price of the commodity at delivery in order to induce speculators to purchase the other side the long side of the same futures contract the commodity producer generally must sell the futures contract at a lower price than the expected future spot price conversely if most hedgers in the futures market are endusers of the underlying product and are therefore purchasing futures      contracts to hedge against a rise in commodity prices then speculators will only sell the other side of the futures contract at a higher futures price than the expected future spot price of the commodity the changing nature of the participants in the commodity markets will influence whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price which can have significant implications for the fund as a result when the adviser reinvests the proceeds from a maturing contract it may purchase a new futures contract at a higher or lower price than the expected futures spot price of the maturing contract or choose to pursue other investments     ¡    speculative position limits the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” and domestic exchanges have established speculative position limits “position limits” on the maximum speculative position that any person or group of persons acting in concert may hold or control in particular contracts and certain related swaps under current regulations other accounts managed by the adviser are combined with the positions held by the fund under the adviser’s management for position limit purposes this trading could prelude additional trading in such contracts by the adviser for the account of the fund swaps the fund may enter into swap agreements including interest rate total return credit default and volatility swaps swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for a specified period of time typically ranging from a few weeks to more than one year the swapped returns are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount that is the return on a particular dollar amount invested in the underlying asset in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or the difference between the returns earned or realized on a particular asset such as an equity or debt security commodity or currency or nonasset reference such as an interest rate or index the fund may enter into swap agreements to among other reasons gain exposure to certain markets in the most economical way possible protect against currency fluctuations or reduce risk arising from a particular portfolio position the fund may enter into swap transactions with certain counterparties pursuant to master netting agreements a master netting agreement provides that all swaps done between the fund and that counterparty shall be regarded as parts of an integral agreement if amounts are payable on a particular date in the same currency in respect of more than one swap transaction the amount payable shall be the net amount in addition the master netting agreement may provide that if one party defaults generally or on any swap the counterparty can terminate all outstanding swaps with that party as a result to the extent the fund enters into master netting agreements with a counterparty the fund may be required to terminate a greater number of swap agreements than if it had not entered into such an agreement which may result in losses to the fund the use of swap agreements by the fund entails certain risks swap agreements entail credit risk arising from the possibility that the counterparty will default if the counterparty defaults the fund’s loss will consist of the net amount of contractual payments that the fund has not yet received the adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties to the fund’s swap transactions on an ongoing basis swap agreements may effectively add leverage to the fund’s portfolio because the fund would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap swap agreements also involve liquidity risk   •   interest rate swaps the fund may enter into interest rate swaps in an interest rate swap the fund and another party exchange the right to receive or the obligation to pay interest on a security or other reference rate for example they might swap the right to receive floating rate payments for fixed rate payments there is a risk that based on movements of interest rates the payments made by the fund under a swap agreement will be greater than the payments it receives   •   total return swaps the fund may enter into total return swaps under which one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset such as a security or basket of securities or nonasset reference such as a securities index during the specified period in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the total return from different underlying assets or references total return swaps could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated by the adviser    •   credit default swaps the fund may enter into credit default swaps a credit default swap enables an investor to buy or sell protection against a credit event such as a borrower’s or issuer’s failure to make timely payments of interest or principal bankruptcy or restructuring the fund may seek to enhance returns by selling protection or attempt to mitigate credit risk by buying protection against the occurrence of a credit event by a specified borrower or issuer the fund may enter into credit default swaps both directly “unfunded swaps” and indirectly “funded swaps” in the form of a swap embedded within a structured security unfunded and funded credit default swaps may refer to a single security or a basket of securities if the fund buys credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs the fund will deliver the defaulted bond underlying the swap and the swap counterparty will pay the par amount of the bond if the fund sells credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs the fund will pay the par amount of the defaulted bond underlying the swap and the swap counterparty will deliver the bond if the swap is on a basket of assets the notional amount of the swap is reduced by the par amount of the defaulted asset and the fixed payments are then made on the reduced notional amount risks of credit default swaps include counterparty credit risk if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and the risk that the fund will not properly assess the cost of the instrument based on the lack of transparency in the market if the fund is selling credit protection there is a risk that a credit event will occur and that the fund will have to pay par value on defaulted bonds if the fund is buying credit protection there is a risk that no credit event will occur and the fund will receive no benefit for the premium paid in addition if the fund is buying credit protection and a credit event does occur there is a risk when the fund does not own the underlying asset that the fund will have difficulty acquiring the asset on the open market and may receive adverse pricing   •   volatility swap contracts the fund may enter into volatility swaps to hedge the direction of volatility in a particular asset or nonasset reference or for other nonspeculative purposes for volatility swaps counterparties agree to buy or sell volatility at a specific level over a fixed period volatility swaps are subject to credit risks if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and the risk that the adviser is incorrect in forecasts of volatility of the underlying asset or reference   •   swap options and swap forwards the fund also may enter into options on swaps as well as forwards on swaps a swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right but not the obligation to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten extend cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement on predesignated terms the fund may write sell and purchase put and call swap options a swap forward is an agreement to enter into a swap agreement at some point in the future usually three to six months from the date of the contract the writer of the contract receives the premium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the preset rate on the underlying swap the fund generally will incur a greater risk when it writes a swap option than when it purchases a swap option when the fund purchases a swap option it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid if the fund lets the option expire unexercised when the fund writes a swap option it will become obligated upon exercise of the option by the counterparty according to the terms of the underlying agreement options the fund may buy or write sell call options and put options on securities indices and currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts stock index futures swaps including eventlinked swaps commodities  futures and other derivative instruments a call option typically gives the option buyer the right but not the obligation to buy and requires the option seller to sell a reference instrument at an agreedupon price a put option gives the option buyer the right but not the obligation to sell and requires the option seller to purchase a reference instrument at an agreedupon price if an option is exercised the fund will either purchase or sell the reference instrument at the strike price or pay or receive the difference between the strike price and the current price level of the reference instrument depending on the terms of the option the premium the exercise price and the market value of the applicable underlying instrument together will determine the gain or loss realized by the fund as the seller of the option    the value of options may be adversely affected if the market for such options becomes less liquid or smaller the fund’s ability to close out its position as a seller of an otc option or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market the fund’s ability to terminate otc options is more limited than with exchangetraded options and may involve the risk that brokerdealers participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations options are marked to market daily and their value will be affected by changes in the value of the underlying securities changes in the dividend rates of the underlying securities an increase in interest rates changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the stock market and the underlying instruments and the remaining time to the options’ expiration additionally the exercise price of an option may be adjusted downward before the option’s expiration as a result of the occurrence of certain corporate or other events affecting the underlying instrument such as extraordinary dividends stock splits merger or other extraordinary distributions or events a reduction in the exercise price of an option would reduce the fund’s capital appreciation potential on the underlying instrument options on futures the fund may enter into options on futures contracts an option on a futures contract gives the buyer in return for the premium paid the right but not the obligation to either buy or sell the underlying futures contract during a certain period of time for a fixed price the writing of a put or call option on a futures contract involves risks similar to the risks applicable to the purchase or sale of futures contracts however the difficulty of predicting changes in the value of the underlying futures contract may expose the fund to a somewhat different set of risks for example variations in speculative market demand for futures on the relevant underlying reference asset can cause the value of the futures to change at an unanticipated time or to an unanticipated degree this or other factors may bring the value of the underlying future closer to the option’s strike price increasing the potential for risk of loss to the fund to the extent that the fund enters into options on futures contracts for hedging purposes an imperfect correlation between this derivative position and the value of the instrument underlying such a position could lead to losses foreign currency transactions the fund also may purchase and sell foreign currency options and foreign currency futures contracts and related options and may engage in foreign currency transactions either on a spot cash basis at the rate prevailing in the currency exchange market at the time or through deliverable and nondeliverable forward foreign currency exchange contracts “forwards” the fund may but is not required to engage in these transactions in order to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign exchange rates in the purchase and sale of securities the fund may also use foreign currency options and foreign currency forward contracts to increase exposure to a foreign currency or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country to another suitable currency hedging transactions may not be available in all circumstances and the adviser may decide not to use hedging transactions that are available under a forward contract one party agrees to purchase and another party agrees to sell a specific currency at a future date that date may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties the transaction price is set at the time the contract is entered into these contracts are traded in the interbank market conducted directly among currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers the fund may use currency forward contracts to protect against uncertainty in the level of future exchange rates the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities the fund owns or intends to acquire but it does fix a rate of exchange in advance although forward contracts may reduce the risk of loss from a decline in the value of the hedged currency at the same time they limit any potential gain if the value of the hedged currency increases when the fund enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency or when it anticipates receiving dividend payments in a foreign currency the fund might desire to “lockin” the us dollar price of the security or the us dollar equivalent of the dividend payments to do so the fund could enter into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in the    underlying transaction in a fixed amount of us dollars per unit of the foreign currency this is called a “transaction hedge” the transaction hedge will protect the fund against a loss from an adverse change in the currency exchange rates during the period between the date on which the security is purchased or sold or on which the payment is declared and the date on which the payments are made or received the fund could also use forward contracts to lock in the us dollar value of portfolio positions this is called a “position hedge” when the fund believes that a foreign currency might suffer a substantial decline against the us dollar it could enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of that foreign currency approximating the value of some or all of the fund’s portfolio securities denominated in that foreign currency when the fund believes that the us dollar might suffer a substantial decline against a foreign currency it could enter into a forward contract to buy that foreign currency for a fixed dollar amount alternatively the fund could enter into a forward contract to sell a different foreign currency for a fixed us dollar amount if the fund believes that the us dollar value of the foreign currency to be sold pursuant to its forward contract will fall whenever there is a decline in the us dollar value of the currency in which portfolio securities of the fund are denominated that is referred to as a “cross hedge” to avoid excess transactions and transaction costs the fund may maintain a net exposure to forward contracts in excess of the value of the fund’s portfolio securities or other assets denominated in foreign currencies subject to appropriate cover or asset segregation the precise matching of the amounts under forward contracts and the value of the securities involved generally will not be possible because the future value of securities denominated in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements between the date the forward contract is entered into and the date it is sold in some cases the adviser might decide to sell the security and deliver foreign currency to settle the original purchase obligation if the market value of the security is less than the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver the fund might have to purchase additional foreign currency on the “spot” that is cash market to settle the security trade if the market value of the security instead exceeds the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver to settle the trade the fund might have to sell on the spot market some of the foreign currency received upon the sale of the security there will be additional transaction costs on the spot market in those cases the projection of shortterm currency market movements is extremely difficult and the successful execution of a shortterm hedging strategy is highly uncertain forward contracts involve the risk that anticipated currency movements will not be accurately predicted causing the fund to sustain losses on these contracts and to pay additional transaction costs the use of forward contracts in this manner might reduce the fund’s performance if there are unanticipated changes in currency prices to a greater degree than if the fund had not entered into such contracts at or before the maturity of a forward contract requiring the fund to sell a currency the fund might sell a portfolio security and use the sale proceeds to make delivery of the currency in the alternative the fund might retain the security and offset its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing a second contract under that contract the fund will obtain on the same maturity date the same amount of the currency that it is obligated to deliver similarly the fund might close out a forward contract requiring it to purchase a specified currency by entering into a second contract entitling it to sell the same amount of the same currency on the maturity date of the first contract the fund would realize a gain or loss as a result of entering into such an offsetting forward contract under either circumstance the gain or loss will depend on the extent to which the exchange rate or rates between the currencies involved moved between the execution dates of the first contract and offsetting contract the costs to the fund of engaging in forward contracts varies with factors such as the currencies involved the length of the contract period and the market conditions then prevailing because forward contracts are usually entered into on a principal basis no brokerage fees or commissions are involved because these contracts are not    traded on an exchange the fund must evaluate the credit and performance risk of the counterparty under each forward contract although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis the fund may convert foreign currency from time to time and will incur costs in doing so foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion but they do seek to realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at which they buy and sell various currencies thus a dealer might offer to sell a foreign currency to one fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange if the fund desires to resell that currency to the dealer hedging although it is not obligated to do so the fund can use derivatives to hedge the fund can use hedging to attempt to protect against declines in the market value of the fund’s portfolio to permit the fund to retain unrealized gains in the value of portfolio securities that have appreciated or to facilitate selling securities for investment reasons the fund can use hedging to establish a portfolio position as a temporary substitute for purchasing particular securities in that case the fund would normally seek to purchase the securities and then terminate that hedging position the fund might also use this type of hedge to attempt to protect against the possibility that its portfolio securities would not be fully included in a rise in value of the market the fund can use derivatives to hedge by taking or long or short positions in the underlying securities related securities or other derivatives positions to gain long investment exposure the fund may invest in securities directly to gain short investment exposure the fund may use derivatives including futures some of the hedging strategies the fund can use are described below the fund may use additional hedging strategies as discussed elsewhere in this sai and it may employ new hedging strategies when they are developed if those investment methods are consistent with the fund’s investment objectives and are permissible under applicable regulations governing the fund   •   “structured” notes the fund can invest in “structured” notes which are speciallydesigned derivative debt investments whose principal payments or interest payments are linked to the value of an underlying asset such as an equity or debt security currency or commodity or nonasset reference such as an interest rate or index the terms of the instrument may be “structured” by the purchaser the fund and the borrower issuing the note the values of these notes will fall or rise in response to changes in the values of the underlying asset or reference and the fund might receive less principal or interest if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated in some cases these notes may pay an amount based on a multiple of the relative change in value of the asset or reference this type of note offers the potential for increased income or principal payments but at a greater risk of loss than a typical debt security of the same maturity and credit quality subordinated “structured” notes which are subordinated to the right of payment of another class typically have higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated “structured” notes the values of these notes are also subject to both credit risk if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and interest rate risk and therefore the fund could receive more or less than it originally invested when a note matures the prices of these notes may be very volatile and they may have a limited trading market making it difficult for the fund to value them or sell them at an acceptable price   •   swaps swap options and swap forwards the fund can invest in swap agreements including interest rate total return credit default and volatility swaps and options and forwards thereon for hedging purposes as described more fully under “swaps” above hedging with options and futures — risks the use of hedging strategies requires special skills and knowledge of investment techniques that are different than what is required for normal portfolio management if the adviser uses a hedging strategy at the wrong time or judges market conditions incorrectly hedging strategies    may reduce the fund’s return the fund could also experience losses if the prices of its futures and options positions were not correlated with its other investments the fund’s option activities could affect its portfolio turnover rate and brokerage commissions the exercise of calls written by the fund might cause the fund to sell related portfolio securities thus increasing its turnover rate the exercise by the fund of puts on securities will cause the sale of underlying investments increasing portfolio turnover although the decision whether to exercise a put it holds is within the fund’s control holding a put might cause the fund to sell the related investments for reasons that would not exist in the absence of the put the fund could pay a brokerage commission each time it buys a call or put sells a call or put or buys or sells an underlying investment in connection with the exercise of a call or put those commissions could be higher on a relative basis than the commissions for direct purchases or sales of the underlying investments premiums paid for options are small in relation to the market value of the underlying investments consequently put and call options offer large amounts of leverage the leverage offered by trading in options could result in the fund’s net asset value being more sensitive to changes in the value of the underlying investment if a covered call written by the fund is exercised on an underlying investment that has increased in value the fund will be required to sell the investment at the call price it will not be able to realize any profit if the investment has increased in value above the call price an option position may be closed out only on a market that provides secondary trading for options of the same series and there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option the fund might experience losses if it could not close out a position because of an illiquid market for the future or option there is a risk in using short hedging by selling futures or purchasing puts on broadlybased indices or futures to attempt to protect against declines in the value of the fund’s portfolio securities the risk is that the prices of the futures or the applicable index will correlate imperfectly with the behavior of the cash prices of the fund’s securities for example it is possible that while the fund has used derivative instruments in a short hedge the market may advance and the value of the securities held in the fund’s portfolio might decline if that occurred the fund would lose money on the derivative instruments and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities the risk of imperfect correlation increases as the composition of the fund’s portfolio diverges from the securities included in the applicable index to compensate for the imperfect correlation of movements in the price of the portfolio securities being hedged and movements in the price of the hedging instruments the fund might use derivative instruments in a greater dollar amount than the dollar amount of portfolio securities being hedged it might do so if the historical volatility of the prices of the portfolio securities being hedged is more than the historical volatility of the applicable index the ordinary spreads between prices in the cash and futures markets are subject to distortions due to differences in the nature of those markets first all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which could distort the normal relationship between the cash and futures markets second the liquidity of the futures market depends on participants entering into offsetting transactions rather than making or taking delivery to the extent participants decide to make or take delivery liquidity in the futures market could be reduced thus producing distortion third from the point of view of speculators the deposit requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities markets therefore increased participation by speculators in the futures market may cause temporary price distortions the fund can use derivative instruments to establish a position in the securities markets as a temporary substitute for the purchase of individual securities long hedging by buying futures andor calls on such futures broadly    based indices or on securities it is possible that when the fund does so the market might decline if the fund then concludes not to invest in securities because of concerns that the market might decline further or for other reasons the fund will realize a loss on the hedge position that is not offset by a reduction in the price of the securities purchased counterparty risk the fund will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which or the brokers dealers and exchanges through which it deals whether it engages in exchange traded or offexchange transactions if the fund’s fcm becomes bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise defaults on its obligations to the fund the fund may not receive all amounts owed to it in respect of its trading despite the clearinghouse fully discharging all of its obligations the commodity exchange act requires an fcm to segregate all funds received from its customers with respect to cleared derivatives transactions from such fcm’s proprietary funds if an fcm were not to do so to the full extent required by law the assets of an account might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy of an fcm furthermore in the event of an fcm’s bankruptcy the fund would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of an fcm’s combined customer accounts even though certain property specifically traceable to the fund for example us treasury bills deposited by the fund may be held by the fcm fcm bankruptcies have occurred in which customers were unable to recover from the fcm’s estate the full amount of their funds owed and on deposit with such fcm such situations could arise due to various factors or a combination of factors including inadequate fcm capitalization inadequate controls on customer trading and inadequate customer capital in addition an fcm will generally provide the clearinghouse the net amount of variation margin required for cleared swaps for all of its customers in the aggregate rather than individually for each customer the fund is therefore subject to the risk that a clearinghouse will not make variation margin payments owed to the fund if another customer of the clearing member has suffered a loss and is in default the fund may also be subject to the risk that it will be required to provide additional variation margin to the clearinghouse before the clearinghouse will move the fund’s cleared derivatives transactions to another clearing member furthermore in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a clearinghouse the fund might experience a loss of funds deposited through its fcm as margin with the clearinghouse a loss of unrealized profits on its open positions and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions such a bankruptcy or insolvency might also cause a substantial delay before the fund could obtain the return of funds owed to it by an fcm who was a member of such clearinghouse in the case of cleared swaps the fcm is required to notify the clearinghouse of the initial margin provided by the clearing member to the clearinghouse that is attributable to each customer however if the fcm does not accurately report the fund’s initial margin the fund is subject to the risk that a clearinghouse will use the fund’s assets held in an omnibus account at the clearinghouse to satisfy payment obligations of a defaulting customer of the clearing member to the clearinghouse because bilateral derivative transactions are traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships the fund is subject to the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under the related contracts although the fund intends to enter into transactions only with counterparties which the adviser believes to be creditworthy there can be no assurance that a counterparty will not default and that the fund will not sustain a loss on a transaction as a result in situations where the fund is required to post margin or other collateral with a counterparty the counterparty may fail to segregate the collateral or may commingle the collateral with the counterparty’s own assets as a result in the event of the counterparty’s bankruptcy or insolvency the fund’s collateral may be subject to the conflicting claims of the counterparty’s creditors and the fund may be exposed to the risk of a court treating the fund as a general unsecured creditor of the counterparty rather than as the owner of the collateral the fund is subject to the risk that issuers of the fund’s portfolio instruments may default on their obligations under those instruments and that certain events may occur that have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the value of those instruments there can be no assurance that an issuer of an instrument in which the fund invests will not default or that an event that has an immediate and significant adverse effect on the value of an instrument will not occur and that the fund will not sustain a loss on a transaction as a result    transactions entered into by the fund may be executed on various us and nonus exchanges and may be cleared and settled through various clearinghouses custodians depositories and prime brokers throughout the world although the fund attempts to execute clear and settle the transactions through entities the adviser believes to be sound there can be no assurance that a failure by any such entity will not lead to a loss to the fund margin the fund may post cash securities or other assets and these instruments may not be denominated in the same currency as the contract they secure or the underlying instrument of the contract this may give rise to a form of currency exposure where changes in the value of foreign currencies can impact the value of the margin on deposit the fund may at times have significant margin obligations to brokerdealers or other entities as a result of listed or otc derivatives positions the fund may use a triparty collateral protection mechanism triparty arrangements may result in higher costs than if the fund had posted margin directly the fund may also establish alternative collateral mechanisms in order to achieve a balance between cost and counterparty credit risk to the fund asset segregationcover to the extent obligations created by the fund may be deemed to create “senior securities” as defined in the  act the fund may be required to segregate or earmark liquid assets the fund will segregate with its custodian or otherwise designate on its records “earmark” cash cash equivalents or liquid assets in an amount the fund believes to be adequate to ensure that it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations under its derivatives contracts or the fund may engage in other measures to “cover” its obligations with respect to such transactions in accordance with applicable requirements under the  act and related guidance of the commission and its staff the amounts that are segregated or earmarked may be based on the derivative’s notional value or on the daily marktomarket obligation under the derivatives contract and may be reduced by amounts on deposit with the applicable broker or counterparty to the derivatives transaction the fund may segregate or earmark amounts in addition to the amounts described above for example if the fund writes a physically settled put option it will typically segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the exercise price of the option less margin on deposit or hold the reference instrument directly if the fund writes a cash settled put option it will typically segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the amount the option is in the money meaning the difference between the exercise price of the option and the current market price of the reference instrument when the exercise price of the option is higher than the market price of the reference instrument marked to market on a daily basis less margin on deposit alternatively the fund may in certain circumstances enter into an offsetting position rather than segregating or designating liquid assets eg the fund may cover a written put option with a purchased put option with the same or higher exercise price or cover a written call option with a purchased call option with the same or lower exercise price although the adviser will attempt to ensure that the fund has sufficient liquid assets in respect of its obligations under its derivative contracts it is possible that the fund’s liquid assets may be insufficient to support such obligations under its derivatives positions the fund may modify its asset segregation policies from time to time regulatory issues the adviser is registered with the us commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” as a commodity pool operator “cpo” however with respect to the fund the adviser has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term cpo under the commodity exchange act the “cea” pursuant to cftc rule  accordingly the adviser with respect to the fund is not subject to registration or regulation as a cpo under the cea to remain eligible for the exclusion the fund will be limited in its ability to use certain financial instruments regulated under the cea “commodity interests” including futures and options on futures and certain swaps transactions tax aspects of certain derivative instruments risks the fund’s investments in options and other derivative instruments could affect the amount timing and character of its distributions to the fund which in turn could affect the amount timing and character of the fund’s distributions in some cases the tax treatment of such investments may not be certain the tax issues relating to these and other types of investments and transactions are described more fully under “tax status” below    additional information about other investments of the fund reits the fund may invest in pooled real estate investment vehicles “reits” and other real estaterelated investments such as securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry reits are subject to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate factors affecting real estate values include the supply of real property in particular markets overbuilding changes in zoning laws casualty or condemnation losses delays in completion of construction changes in operations costs and property taxes levels of occupancy adequacy of rent to cover operating expenses possible environmental liabilities regulatory limitations on rent fluctuations in rental income increased competition and other risks related to local and regional market conditions the value of real estaterelated investments also may be affected by changes in interest rates macroeconomic developments and social and economic trends for instance during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those reits some reits have relatively small market capitalizations which can tend to increase the volatility of the market prices of their securities reits are pooled investment vehicles that invest in real estate or real estaterelated companies the funds may invest in different types of reits including equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits equity reits which invest in and own real estate directly generally invest a majority of their assets in incomeproducing properties to generate cash flow from rental income and gradual asset appreciation the incomeproducing properties in which equity reits invest typically include land office retail industrial hotel and apartment buildings self storage specialty and diversified and healthcare facilities equity reits can realize capital gains or losses by selling properties that have appreciated or depreciated in value mortgage reits which make construction development or longterm mortgage loans generally invest the majority of their assets in real estate mortgages or mortgagebacked securities and derive their income primarily from interest payments on the mortgages hybrid reits share characteristics of equity reits and mortgage reits reits can be listed and traded on national securities exchanges or can be traded privately between individual owners an exchangetraded reit is generally more liquid than a reit that is not traded on a securities exchange the fund may invest in both exchangetraded and privately traded reits in general the value of a reit’s shares changes in light of factors affecting the real estate industry in addition equity reits may be affected by any changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts while mortgage reits may be affected by the quality of any credit extended reits are also subject to the risk of fluctuations in income from underlying real estate assets poor performance by the reit’s manager and the manager’s inability to manage cash flows generated by the reit’s assets prepayments and defaults by borrowers selfliquidation adverse changes in the tax laws and with regard to certain reits the risk of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the code andor to maintain exempt status under the  act if a reit were not to be eligible for the favorable tax treatment afforded to reits under the code it would be subject to federal income tax thus reducing its value by investing in reits indirectly through the fund an investor will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the fund but also indirectly similar expenses of reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to investors leverage the fund may use leverage although the use of leverage may create an opportunity for increased returns of the fund it also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses and thus could negatively impact the fund’s business and results of operation and have important adverse consequences to the fund’s investments the loss on leverage transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment the terms of financing arrangements entered into by the fund or its subsidiaries may restrict the fund’s or a subsidiary’s operating flexibility including covenants that among others may limit the fund’s ability to i pay distributions in certain circumstances ii incur additional debt and iii engage in certain transactions if the    fund or a subsidiary secures its leverage through the pledging of collateral the fund or subsidiary may if the fund or subsidiary is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet principal and interest payments on its indebtedness be subject to risk that it is required to surrender its collateral and that such collateral may be liquidated at inopportune times or at prices that are not favorable to the fund and cause significant losses if a lender seizes and liquidates pledged collateral such collateral may be sold at distressed price levels the fund will fail to realize the full value of such asset in a distressed sale the fund or its subsidiaries may be required to pay commitment fees and other costs of borrowings under the terms of a credit facility moreover interest on borrowings will be an expense of the fund with the use of borrowings there is a risk that the interest rates paid by the fund or a subsidiary on the amount it borrows will be higher than the return on the fund’s investments such additional costs and expenses may affect the operating results of the fund if the fund or its subsidiaries cannot generate sufficient cash flow from investments they may need to refinance all or a portion of indebtedness on or before maturity the us capital markets have recently experienced historic dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused financing to be unavailable in many cases and even if available have caused the cost of prospective financings to increase these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets making financing terms for borrowers able to find financing less attractive and in many cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing continued uncertainty in the debt and equity markets may negatively impact the fund’s or a subsidiary’s ability to access financing on favorable terms or at all the inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the fund’s operations and on its ability to meet its debt obligations if it is unable to refinance any of its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all the fund’s returns may be harmed operational risk the fund its service providers and other market participants increasingly depend on complex information technology and communications systems to conduct business functions these systems are subject to a number of different threats or risks that could adversely affect the fund and its shareholders for example unauthorized third parties may attempt to improperly access modify disrupt the operations of or prevent access to these systems or data within them a “cyberattack” whether systems of the fund the fund’s service providers counterparties or other market participants power or communications outages acts of god information technology equipment malfunctions operational errors both human and systematic and inaccuracies within software or data processing systems may also disrupt business operations or impact critical data market events also may occur at a pace that overloads current information technology and communication systems and processes of the fund the fund’s service providers or other market participants impacting the ability to conduct the fund’s operations cyberattacks disruptions or failures that affect the fund’s service providers or counterparties may adversely affect the fund and its shareholders including by causing losses for the fund or impairing fund operations in addition cyberattacks disruptions or failures may cause reputational damage and subject the fund or its service providers to regulatory fines litigation costs penalties or financial losses reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs the fund and its service providers may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk management in order to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents and the fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result of such costs as described under “alternative lending operational and technology risk” in the prospectus similar types of operational both human and systematic and technology risks are also present for issuers of securities or other instruments in which the fund invests which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the fund’s investments to lose value in addition cyberattacks involving a fund counterparty could affect such counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations to the fund which may result in losses to the fund and its shareholders furthermore as a result of cyberattacks disruptions or failures an exchange or market may close or issue trading halts on specific securities or the entire market which may result in among other things    the fund’s inability to buy or sell certain securities or financial instruments or to accurately price its investments the fund cannot directly control any cybersecurity plans or systems put in place by its service providers fund counterparties issuers in which the fund invests or securities markets and exchanges money market instruments the fund can invest in money market instruments which are us dollardenominated highquality shortterm debt obligations to provide liquidity for temporary defensive purposes or for other purposes money market instruments may have fixed variable or floating interest rates examples of money market instruments include obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities bank obligations such as time deposits certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances commercial paper and variable amount master demand notes obligations issued or guaranteed by us government agencies or instrumentalities these include direct obligations and mortgagerelated securities that have different levels of credit support from the us government some are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states such as government national mortgage association passthrough mortgage certificates called “ginnie maes” some are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury under certain circumstances such as federal national mortgage association bonds “fannie maes” and federal home loan mortgage corporation obligations “freddie macs” others are supported only by the credit of the entity that issued them securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are also supported by commitments from the us treasury to purchase certain of those agencies’ securities during market conditions in which the us treasury deems it necessary for the promotion of market stability in september  the federal housing finance agency an independent regulatory agency placed the federal national mortgage corporation and federal home loan mortgage corporation into conservatorship the us department of treasury also entered into a new secured lending credit facility with those companies and a preferred stock purchase agreement under the preferred stock purchase agreement the treasury will ensure that each company maintains a positive net worth us treasury obligations these include treasury bills which have maturities of one year or less when issued treasury notes which have maturities of one to ten years when issued and treasury bonds which have maturities of more than ten years when issued treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states as to timely payments of interest and repayments of principal similar to other issuers changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of the fund’s direct or indirect investment in treasury obligations to decline on august   sp downgraded us treasury securities from aaa rating to aa a downgrade of the ratings of us government debt obligations which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers cause disruptions in the international bond markets and generally have a substantial negative effect on the us economy a downgrade of treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade beyond aa rating by sp may cause the value of the fund’s treasury obligations to decline the fund can also buy or gain exposure to us treasury securities whose interest coupons have been “stripped” by a federal reserve bank zerocoupon us treasury securities described below and treasury inflationprotection securities “tips” the us treasury securities called “tips” are designed to provide an investment that is not vulnerable to inflation the interest rate paid by tips is fixed the principal value rises or falls semiannually based on changes in the published consumer price index if inflation occurs the principal and interest payments on tips are adjusted to protect investors from inflationary loss if deflation occurs the principal and interest payments will be adjusted downward although the principal will not fall below its face amount at maturity any increase in the principal amount of an inflationindexed bond will be considered taxable ordinary income even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity    zerocoupon securities the fund can invest directly or indirectly in zerocoupon securities zerocoupon us government securities will typically be us treasury notes and us treasury bonds that have been stripped of their interest coupons or certificates representing interests in those stripped debt obligations and coupons zerocoupon securities do not make periodic interest payments and are sold at a deep discount from their face value at maturity the buyer recognizes a rate of return determined by the gradual appreciation of the security which is redeemed at face value on a specified maturity date this discount depends on the time remaining until maturity as well as prevailing interest rates the liquidity of the security and the credit quality of the issuer the discount typically decreases as the maturity date approaches because zerocoupon securities pay no interest and compound semiannually at the rate fixed at the time of their issuance their value is generally more volatile than the value of other debt securities that pay interest their value may fall more dramatically than the value of interestbearing securities when interest rates rise when prevailing interest rates fall zerocoupon securities tend to rise more rapidly in value because they have a fixed rate of return the fund’s exposure to zerocoupon securities may cause the fund to recognize income for federal income tax purposes without a corresponding receipt of cash this can require the fund to dispose of investments including when not otherwise advantageous to do so to meet distribution requirements the fund may also obtain exposure to zerocoupon and delayed interest securities and “stripped” securities of us and foreign corporations and of foreign government issuers these are similar in structure to zerocoupon and “stripped” us government securities but in the case of foreign government securities may or may not be backed by the “full faith and credit” of the issuing foreign government zerocoupon securities issued by foreign governments and by corporations will be subject to greater credit risks than us government zerocoupon securities additional investment strategies and risks of the fund exchangetraded funds the fund may invest directly or indirectly in etfs which are investment companies or special purpose trusts whose primary objective is to achieve the same rate of return as a particular market index while trading throughout the day on an exchange the fund may purchase and sell individual shares of etfs in the secondary market these secondary market transactions require the payment of commissions investments in etfs are subject to the same risks as investments in other investment companies as described above certain risks of investing in an etf are similar to those of investing in an indexed mutual fund including tracking error risk the risk of errors in matching the etf’s underlying assets to the index and the risk that because an etf is not actively managed it cannot sell poorly performing stocks as long as they are represented in the index other etf risks include the risk that etfs may trade in the secondary market at a discount from their navs and the risk that the etfs may not be liquid furthermore there may be times when the exchange halts trading in which case the investors owning etf shares would be unable to sell them until trading is resumed in addition because etfs often invest in a portfolio of common stocks and “track” a designated index an overall decline in stocks comprising an etf’s benchmark index could have a greater impact on the etf and investors than might be the case in an investment company with a more widely diversified portfolio losses could also occur if the etf is unable to replicate the performance of the chosen benchmark index other risks associated with etfs include the possibility that i an etf’s distributions may decline if the issuers of the etf’s portfolio securities fail to continue to pay dividends and ii under certain circumstances an etf could be terminated should termination occur the etf could have to liquidate its portfolio when the prices for those assets are falling in addition inadequate or irregularly provided information about an etf or its investments could expose investors in etfs to unknown risks    exchangetraded notes “etns” an investment in an etn involves risks including possible loss of principal etns are unsecured debt securities issued by a bank that are linked to the total return of a market index risks of investing in etns also include limited portfolio diversification uncertain principal payment and illiquidity additionally the investor fee will reduce the amount of return on maturity or at redemption and as a result the investor may receive less than the principal amount a maturity or upon redemption even if the value of the relevant index has increased floating rate and variable rate obligations the fund can invest directly or indirectly in debt securities unrelated to the alternative lending industry that have floating or variable interest rates those variable rate obligations may have a demand feature that allows the fund to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party prior to its maturity the tender may be at par value plus accrued interest according to the terms of the obligations because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates falling shortterm interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to the fund on its floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income however investments in floating rate and variable rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in the fund’s net asset value during periods of changing interest rates compared to changes in values of fixedrate debt securities nevertheless changes in interest rates can affect the value of the fund’s floating rate investments especially if rates change sharply in a short period because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates having a shorter average reset period for their portfolio of investments may help mitigate that risk the interest rate on a floating rate demand note is adjusted automatically according to a stated prevailing market rate such as the prime rate the day us treasury bill rate or some other standard the instrument’s rate is adjusted automatically each time the base rate is adjusted the interest rate on a variable rate note is also based on a stated prevailing market rate but is adjusted automatically at specified intervals generally the changes in the interest rate on such securities reduce the fluctuation in their market value as interest rates decrease or increase the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation is less than that for fixedrate obligations of the same maturity floating rate and variable rate demand notes that have a stated maturity in excess of one year may have features that permit the holder to recover the principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals not exceeding one year and upon no more than  days’ notice the issuer of that type of note normally has a corresponding right in its discretion after a given period to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the note plus accrued interest generally the issuer must provide a specified number of days’ notice to the holder the fund can also invest directly or indirectly in stepcoupon bonds that have a coupon rate that changes periodically during the life of the security on predetermined dates that are set when the security is issued portfolio turnover purchases and sales of portfolio investments may be made as considered advisable by the adviser in the best interests of the shareholders the fund’s portfolio turnover rate may vary from yeartoyear as well as within a year the fund’s distributions of any net shortterm capital gains realized from portfolio transactions are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income in addition higher portfolio turnover rates can result in corresponding increases in portfolio transaction costs for the fund for reporting purposes the fund’s portfolio turnover rate is calculated by dividing the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the fiscal year by the monthly average of the value of the portfolio securities owned by the fund during the fiscal year in determining such portfolio turnover all securities whose maturities at the time of acquisition were one year or less are excluded a  portfolio turnover rate would occur for example if all of the securities in the fund’s investment portfolio other than shortterm money market securities were replaced once during the fiscal year portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities    repurchase agreements the fund may enter into repurchase agreements with banks and brokerdealers it might do so with temporarily available cash eg pending the investment of the proceeds from sales of fund shares or pending the settlement of portfolio securities transactions or for temporary defensive purposes as described below a repurchase agreement is a contract under which the fund acquires a security for a relatively short period usually less than a week for cash and subject to the commitment of the seller to repurchase the security for an agreedupon price on a specified date the repurchase price exceeds the acquisition price and reflects an agreedupon market rate unrelated to the coupon rate on the purchased security approved sellers include us commercial banks us branches of foreign banks or brokerdealers that have been designated as primary dealers in government securities they must meet credit requirements set by the adviser from time to time repurchase agreements afford the fund the opportunity to earn a return on temporarily available cash without market risk although the fund bears the risk of a seller’s failure to meet its obligation to pay the repurchase price when it is required to do so such a default may subject the fund to expenses delays and risks of loss including i possible declines in the value of the underlying security while the fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto ii possible reduced levels of income and lack of access to income during this period and iii the inability to enforce its rights and the expenses involved in attempted enforcement entering into repurchase agreements entails certain risks which include the risk that the counterparty to the repurchase agreement may not be able to fulfill its obligations as discussed above that the parties may disagree as to the meaning or application of contractual terms or that the instrument may not perform as expected there is no limit on the amount of the fund’s net assets that may be subject to repurchase agreements having maturities of seven days or less reverse repurchase agreements the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and brokers reverse repurchase agreements involve sales by the fund of portfolio securities concurrently with an agreement by the fund to repurchase the same securities at a later date at a fixed price during the reverse repurchase agreement period the fund continues to receive principal and interest payments on the securities and also has the opportunity to earn a return on the collateral furnished by the counterparty to secure its obligation to redeliver the securities if the buyer in a reverse repurchase agreement files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent the fund’s use of proceeds from the sale of its securities may be restricted while the other party or its trustee or receiver determines whether to honor the fund’s right to repurchase the securities furthermore in that situation the fund may be unable to recover the securities it sold in connection with a reverse repurchase agreement and as a result would realize a loss equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the payment it received for them this loss would be greater to the extent the buyer paid less than the value of the securities the fund sold to it eg a buyer may only be willing to pay  for a bond with a market value of  the fund’s use of reverse repurchase agreements also subjects the fund to interest costs based on the difference between the sale and repurchase price of a security involved in such a transaction additionally reverse repurchase agreements entail the same risks as otc derivatives these include the risk that the counterparty to the reverse repurchase agreement may not be able to fulfill its obligations that the parties may disagree as to the meaning or application of contractual terms or that the instrument may not perform as expected reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls are not considered borrowings by the fund for purposes of the fund’s fundamental investment restriction on borrowings if the fund covers its obligations under these transactions or maintains liquid assets equal in value to its obligations in respect of these transactions securities lending the fund may seek to earn income by lending portfolio securities to brokerdealers or other institutional borrowers the fund may lend up to onethird of the value of its total assets including borrowings or such other amount as is permitted under relevant law the fund will not lend portfolio securities if as a result the aggregate of such loans exceeds  ⁄ of the value of the fund’s total assets including such loans loan arrangements made by the fund will comply with all other applicable regulatory requirements for securities lending including with respect to changes in market values termination interest paid on loaned securities and ability to call back loaned securities for voting    “stripped” securities in addition to buying stripped treasury securities as described herein the fund can invest directly or indirectly in stripped mortgagerelated securities that are created by segregating the cash flows from underlying mortgage loans or mortgage securities to create two or more new securities each has a specified percentage of the underlying security’s principal or interest payments these are a form of derivative investment mortgage securities may be partially stripped so that each class receives some interest and some principal however they may be completely stripped in that case all of the interest is distributed to holders of one type of security known as an “interestonly” security or “io” and all of the principal is distributed to holders of another type of security known as a “principalonly” security or “po” strips can be created for passthrough certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations cmos the yields to maturity of ios and pos are very sensitive to principal repayments including prepayments on the underlying mortgages if the underlying mortgages experience greater than anticipated prepayments of principal the fund might not fully recoup its investment in an io based on those assets if underlying mortgages experience less than anticipated prepayments of principal the yield on the pos based on them could decline substantially “whenissued” and “delayeddelivery” transactions the fund may invest in securities on a “whenissued” basis and may purchase or sell securities on a “delayeddelivery” or “forwardcommitment” basis “whenissued” and “delayeddelivery” are terms that refer to securities whose terms and indenture are available and for which a market exists but which are not available for immediate delivery when such transactions are negotiated the price which is generally expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment is made delivery and payment for the securities take place at a later date the securities are subject to change in value from market fluctuations during the period until settlement the value at delivery may be less than the purchase price for example changes in interest rates in a direction other than that expected by the adviser before settlement will affect the value of such securities and may cause a loss to the fund during the period between purchase and settlement the fund makes no payment to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund from the investment until it receives the security at settlement the fund may engage in whenissued transactions to secure what the adviser considers to be an advantageous price and yield at the time the obligation is entered into when the fund enters into a whenissued or delayeddelivery transaction it relies on the other party to complete the transaction its failure to do so may cause the fund to lose the opportunity to obtain the security at a price and yield the adviser considers to be advantageous when the fund engages in whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions it does so for the purpose of acquiring or selling securities consistent with its investment objective and policies or for delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into and not for the purpose of investment leverage although the fund’s purpose in entering into delayeddelivery or whenissued purchase transactions is to acquire securities it may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the fund chooses to dispose of the right to acquire a whenissued security prior to its acquisition or to dispose of its right to delivery or receive against a forward commitment it may incur a gain or loss at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase or sell a security on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis it records the transaction on its books and reflects the value of the security purchased in determining the fund’s net asset value in a sale transaction it records the proceeds to be received the fund will identify on its books liquid assets at least equal in value to the value of the fund’s purchase commitments until the fund pays for the investment whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions can be used by the fund as a defensive technique to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates and prices for instance in periods of rising interest rates and falling prices the fund might sell securities in its portfolio on a forward commitment basis to attempt to limit its    exposure to anticipated falling prices in periods of falling interest rates and rising prices the fund might sell portfolio securities and purchase the same or similar securities on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis to obtain the benefit of currently higher cash yields illiquid securities the fund may hold illiquid securities including among other instruments securities of some private issuers securities traded in unregulated or shallow markets and securities that are purchased in private placements and are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale because relatively few purchasers of these securities may exist especially in the event of adverse economic and liquidity conditions or adverse changes in the issuer’s financial condition the fund may not be able to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position in such investments at a desirable price or time disposing of illiquid securities may involve timeconsuming negotiation and legal expenses and selling them promptly at an acceptable price may be difficult or impossible certain of the securities in which the fund obtains exposure may be rule a securities which are securities that generally can be purchased and sold only by certain sophisticated investors called “qualified institutional buyers” or “qibs” rule a securities are considered “restricted” securities while certain restricted securities may notwithstanding limitations on resale be treated as liquid if the adviser determines pursuant to the applicable procedures that such treatment is warranted there can be no guarantee that any such determination will continue illiquid securities may be difficult to value the fund may be required to hold illiquid securities when it otherwise would sell such securities or may be forced to sell securities at a price lower than the price the fund has valued such securities this may result in losses to the fund and investors investment restrictions fundamental investment restrictions of the fund the following investment restrictions of the fund are designated as fundamental policies and as such cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the fund’s outstanding voting securities under the  act a “majority” vote is defined as the vote of the holders of the lesser of a  or more of the shares of the fund present at a meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy at the meeting or b more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund under

securities from platforms whose business consists primarily of originating loans of subprime quality as determined by the adviser pursuant to guidelines approved by the board  may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities originated in emerging markets as determined by the adviser pursuant to guidelines approved by the board and  may not purchase loans or other alternative lendingrelated securities from platforms whose financial statements are not audited by a nationally recognized accounting firm where applicable the foregoing investment restrictions shall be interpreted based on the applicable rules regulations and pronouncements of the sec and its staff the adviser will determine whether loans offered to the fund are of subprime quality at the time of investment pursuant to guidelines approved by the board from time to time these guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the fund the adviser must determine that loans have a likelihood of repayment that is greater than that of “subprime” consumer loans “subprime” does not have a specific legal or market definition but is understood in the credit marketplace to signify that a loan has a material likelihood that it will not be repaid the adviser will make the determination that loans purchased by the fund are not of subprime quality based on the adviser’s due diligence of the credit underwriting policies of the originating platform which look to a number of borrowerspecific factors to determine a borrower’s ability to repay a particular loan including employments status income assets education and credit bureau data where available although credit bureau data is only one factor considered in determining the credit quality of a borrower and a loan when fico data is available with respect to a borrower the adviser’s guidelines do not allow the adviser to cause the fund to purchase any consumer loan to an individual whose fico score is below  at the time of origination the adviser will determine whether loans offered to the fund are originated in emerging markets pursuant to guidelines approved by the board from time to time these guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the fund the adviser must determine that loans were originated in a “developed market” country as classified by msci inc by inclusion in the msci world index the countries currently included in the msci world index consist of australia austria belgium canada denmark finland france germany hong kong ireland israel italy japan netherlands new zealand norway portugal singapore spain sweden switzerland the united kingdom and the united states the fund has also adopted the following fundamental policies in connection with administering its investment portfolio a the fund will value each whole loan owned by the fund individually for purposes of determining net asset value b the fund will determine net asset value daily c the fund will only sell shares to or through fiduciaries such as registered investment advisers or retirement plans or institutional investors or to employees directors and affiliates of the fund or the adviser the fund has also adopted the following fundamental policies in order to repurchase its shares   •   on a quarterly basis in the months of february may august and november the fund will make an offer to repurchase a designated percentage of the outstanding shares from shareholders a “repurchase offer” pursuant to rule c under the  act as it may be amended from time to time   •   the fund will repurchase shares that are tendered by a specific date the “repurchase request deadline” the fund’s board will establish the repurchase request deadline for each repurchase offer the      repurchase request deadline will ordinarily be on a date approximately seven days before the date on which the fund’s net asset value applicable to the repurchase offer is determined the “repurchase pricing date” but may be revised by the adviser in its sole discretion based on factors such as market conditions the level of the fund’s assets and shareholder servicing considerations provided that the board is notified of this change and the reasons for it   •   there will be a maximum  calendar day period or the next business day if the th calendar day is not a business day between the repurchase request deadline and the repurchase pricing date summary of  act restrictions on certain activities the fundamental investment limitations set forth above permit the fund to engage in certain practices and purchase securities and other instruments as permitted by or consistent with the  act relevant limitations of the  act as they presently exist are described below these limitations are based either on the  act itself the rules or regulations thereunder or applicable orders of the sec in addition interpretations and guidance provided by the sec staff may be taken into account where deemed appropriate by the fund to determine if a certain practice or the purchase of securities or other instruments is permitted by the  act the rules or regulations thereunder or applicable orders of the sec as a result the foregoing fundamental investment policies may be interpreted differently over time as the statute rules regulations or orders or if applicable interpretations that relate to the meaning and effect of these policies change fundamental investment restriction  the ability of a closedend fund to issue senior securities is circumscribed by complex regulatory constraints under the  act that restrict for instance the amount timing and form of senior securities that may be issued certain portfolio management techniques may be considered senior securities unless appropriate steps are taken to segregate the fund’s assets or otherwise cover its obligations to the extent the fund covers its commitment under these transactions including by the segregation of liquid assets such instrument will not be considered a “senior security” by the fund see “additional information about the fund’s use of derivatives – asset segregationcover” above under the  act a “senior security” does not include i any promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness issued in consideration of any loan extension or renewal thereof made by a bank or other person and privately arranged and not intended to be publicly distributed or ii any promissory note or evidence of indebtedness where such loan is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding  of the value of the total assets of the issuer at the time the loan is made a loan is presumed to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within sixty days and is not extended or renewed fundamental investment restriction  the fund may borrow money in an amount not exceeding   of its total assets including the amount borrowed less liabilities other than borrowings or in connection with engaging in transactions considered by the sec to constitute a form of borrowing under the  act eg reverse repurchase agreements to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment objectives and policies fundamental investment restriction  this restriction would permit the underwriting of securities to the extent permitted under the  act fundamental investment restriction  this restriction would permit the purchase sale or holding of real estate to the extent permitted under the  act real estaterelated instruments include real estate investment trusts commercial and residential mortgagebacked securities and real estate financings the fund does not intend to purchase sell or hold any real estate as part of its principal investment strategy except to the extent associated with alternative lendingrelated securities for example in the case of a small business loan secured in part by real estate owned by the borrower fundamental investment restriction  under the  act the fund may only make loans if expressly permitted to do so by its investment policies as set forth in the fund’s principal investment strategies the fund    is permitted to make loans the fund may not make loans to persons who control or are under common control with the fund fundamental investment restriction  this restriction would permit investment in commodities to the extent permitted under the  act commodities may be deemed to include any commodities contracts including those with underlying bulk goods such as grains metals and foodstuffs futures contracts and related options options and forward contracts the  act does not directly limit the fund’s ability to invest directly in physical commodities however the fund’s direct and indirect investments in physical commodities may be limited by the fund’s intention to qualify as a regulated investment company the fund’s investment strategy and other regulatory requirements while the fund does not intend to invest in commodities the fund may invest in certain derivatives that are regulated by the cftc for the purpose of hedging currency or interest rate risk see “additional information about the fund’s use of derivatives — regulatory issues” above and “tax status” below trustees and officers board of trustees the business and affairs of the fund are managed under the oversight of the board subject to the laws of the state of delaware and the fund’s agreement and declaration of trust the “declaration of trust” the trustees are responsible for oversight of the practices and processes of the fund

adviser and the fund have adopted compliance policies and procedures that are designed to avoid mitigate monitor and oversee areas that could present potential conflicts of interest the adviser attempts to address these potential conflicts of interest through various compliance policies that are generally intended to place all accounts regardless of fee structure on the same footing for investment management purposes the adviser has adopted trade allocation procedures that are designed to facilitate the fair allocation of limited investment opportunities among multiple clients the adviser’s trade allocation policies generally provide that each day’s transactions in securities that are purchased or sold by multiple accounts are averaged as to price and allocated between clients in a manner that is fair and equitable to each client trade allocations are reviewed on a periodic basis as part of the adviser’s trade oversight procedures in an attempt to ensure fairness over time across clients and to monitor whether any client is systematically favored over time there is no guarantee however that the policies and procedures adopted by the adviser and the fund will be able to detect andor prevent every situation in which an actual or potential conflict may appear these potential conflicts include allocation of limited time and attention a portfolio manager who is responsible for managing multiple client accounts may devote unequal time and attention to the management of those accounts as a result the portfolio manager may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment opportunities for each of the accounts as might be the case if he were to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single account the effects of this potential conflict may be more pronounced where accounts overseen by a particular portfolio manager have different investment strategies allocation of limited investment opportunities if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple clients the opportunity may be allocated among these several clients which may limit the fund’s ability to take full advantage of the investment opportunity as a result of regulations governing the ability of certain clients of the adviser to invest sidebyside it is possible that the fund may not be permitted to participate in an investment opportunity at the same time as another fund or another client of the adviser these limitations may limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to the fund the decision as to which funds or other clients of the adviser may participate in any particular investment opportunity will take into account the suitability of the investment opportunity for and the strategy of the applicable funds or other clients it is possible that the fund may be prevented from participating due to such investment opportunity being more appropriately within the primary strategy of another fund or other client of the adviser    conflicts of interest among strategies at times a portfolio manager may determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the clients for which he exercises investment responsibility or may decide that certain of the clients should take differing positions with respect to a particular security in these cases the portfolio manager may place separate transactions for one or more clients which may affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the detriment or benefit of one or more other clients similarly the adviser or its personnel may take positions that are different from those taken by one or more clients conflicts may also arise in cases when clients invest in different parts of an issuer’s capital structure including circumstances in which one or more clients own private securities or obligations of an issuer and other clients may own public securities of the same issuer actions by investors in one part of the capital structure could disadvantage investors in another part of the capital structure in addition purchases or sales of the same investment may be made for two or more clients on the same date there can be no assurance that a client will not receive less or more of a certain investment than it would otherwise receive if this conflict of interest among clients did not exist in effecting transactions it may not be possible or consistent with the investment objectives of clients to purchase or sell securities at the same time or at the same prices selection of brokersdealers portfolio managers may be able to select or influence the selection of the brokers and dealers that are used to execute securities transactions for the clients that they supervise in addition to executing trades some brokers and dealers provide portfolio managers with brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” which may result in the payment of higher brokerage fees than might have otherwise been available these services may be more beneficial to certain funds than to others related business opportunities the adviser or its affiliates may provide more services such as distribution or recordkeeping for some types of clients than for others in such cases a portfolio manager may benefit either directly or indirectly by devoting disproportionate attention to the management of clients that provide greater overall returns to the adviser and its affiliates variation in compensation a conflict of interest may arise where the financial or other benefits available to a portfolio manager differ among the accounts that he manages if the structure of the adviser’s management fee andor a portfolio manager’s compensation differs among clients such as where certain clients pay higher management fees a portfolio manager might be motivated to help certain clients over others a portfolio manager might be motivated to favor accounts in which he has an interest or in which the adviser andor its affiliates have interests similarly the desire to maintain or raise assets under management or to enhance a portfolio manager’s performance record or to derive other rewards financial or otherwise could influence a portfolio manager to lend preferential treatment to those accounts that could most significantly benefit a portfolio manager investments by adviser or related entities the adviser or a related entity has made investments in alternative lendingrelated securities for its or their own accounts prior to the commencement of investment operations of the fund in order to test the investment strategy and infrastructure of the fund and its service providers the adviser or a related entity may make new investments in alternative lendingrelated securities following commencement of investment operations of the fund in addition the adviser or a related entity may invest in entities that may act as sources of leverage for the fund in addition the adviser or a related entity has made and may from time to time make equity investments in one or more companies that operate alternative lending platforms from which the fund may purchase alternative lendingrelated securities    portfolio manager compensation as of march   portfolio managers receive a base salary and may also receive a bonus compensation of a portfolio manager is determined at the discretion of the adviser it may be based on a number of factors including the portfolio manager’s experience responsibilities the perception of the quality of his or her work efforts and the consistency with which he or she demonstrates kindness to other employees trading counterparties vendors and clients as a firm focused on beta the compensation of portfolio managers is not based upon

issuance of an unlimited number of shares the trustees of the fund have authority under the declaration of trust to create and classify shares into separate series and to classify and reclassify any series of shares into one or more classes without further action by shareholders the trustees of the fund may designate additional series and classes in the future from time to time the shares will be issued with a par value of  per share all shares of the fund have equal rights as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation of the fund the shares will when issued be fully paid and nonassessable by the fund and will have no preemptive or conversion rights to cumulative voting the shares are designed primarily for longterm investors and investors in the shares should not view the fund as a vehicle for shortterm trading purposes unlike most closedend funds the fund expects to continuously offer its shares the fund’s shares will not be listed on any securities exchange and will not be publicly traded thus there is no secondary market for the fund’s shares and the fund expects that no secondary market will develop in order to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund has determined that commencing in november  and quarterly thereafter it will make offers to repurchase typically for  of the fund’s outstanding shares at nav subject to approval of the board and in all cases such repurchases will be for at least  and not more than  of its outstanding shares at nav in connection with any given repurchase offer it is possible that the fund may offer to repurchase only the minimum amount of  of its outstanding shares it is also possible that a repurchase offer may be oversubscribed with the result that shareholders may only be able to have a portion of their shares repurchased the fund intends to offer the shares in a continuous offering of its shares at net asset value plus the applicable sales charge there can be no assurance that the fund will offer its shares on a continuous basis or if so offered that it will do so indefinitely    computation of net asset value the fund’s shares are valued as of a particular time the “valuation time” on each day that the new york stock exchange “nyse” opens for business the valuation time is ordinarily at the close of regular trading on the nyse normally  pm eastern time the trust expects that the holidays upon which the nyse will be closed are as follows new year’s day martin luther king jr day washington’s birthday good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day fund liabilities plus any distribution andor servicing fees and any other expenses are deducted from the fund’s assets and the resulting amount is divided by the number of shares outstanding to produce the fund’s per share nav in accordance with regulations governing registered investment companies the fund’s transactions in portfolio securities and purchases and sales of fund shares which bear upon the number of fund shares outstanding are generally not reflected in the nav determined for the business day on which the transactions are effected the trade date but rather on the following business day the board has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund will value its investments the “valuation procedures” the trustees have established a valuation committee comprised of officers of the adviser to which they have delegated responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board in accordance with these procedures the fund’s investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value listed below is a summary of certain of the methods generally used to value investments some or all of which may be held by the fund under the valuation procedures shortterm debt instruments such as commercial paper bankers’ acceptances and us treasury bills having a maturity of less than  days are valued at amortized cost other debt securities including corporate and government debt securities of us or foreign issuers and municipal debt securities in each case having a remaining maturity in excess of  days loans mortgagebacked securities collateralized mortgage obligations and other assetbacked securities are valued by an independent pricing service equity securities are valued at the last sale official close or if there are no reported sales at the mean between the bid and asked price on the primary exchange on which they are traded the values of the fund’s investments in publicly traded foreign equity securities generally will be determined by a pricing service using pricing models designed to estimate likely changes in the values of those securities between the times in which the trading in those securities is substantially completed and the close of the nyse domestic exchangetraded options are generally valued at the mean of their highest bid and lowest ask taken across all exchanges where the options are traded over the counter domestic options not traded on an exchange are valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations foreign options are valued at the settlement price on the exchange on which they are primarily traded nonexchange traded derivatives are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by a pricing service or using quotes provided by a brokerdealer typically the counterparty pursuant to the fund’s policies and procedures most of the fund’s holdings in alternative lendingrelated securities are fair valued based on prices provided by a thirdparty pricing service the fund accounts for whole and fractional loans at the individual loan level for valuation purposes and whole loans are fair valued using inputs that take into account borrowerlevel data eg payment history that is updated periodically as often as the nav is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or loan if market quotations are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or infrequent the fund’s investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to the valuation procedures socalled “fair value pricing” fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security or other asset and fair values used to determine the fund’s nav may differ from    quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments also the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets held by the fund and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security the prospectus provides additional information regarding the circumstances in which fair value pricing may be used and related information portfolio transactions and brokerage investment decisions and portfolio transactions investment decisions for the fund are made with a view to achieving its investment objective investment decisions are the product of many factors in addition to basic suitability for the particular client involved including the fund some securities considered for investment by the fund also may be appropriate for other clients served by the adviser thus a particular security may be bought or sold for certain clients even though it could have been bought or sold for other clients at the same time if a purchase or sale of securities consistent with the investment policies of the fund and one or more of these clients is considered at or about the same time transactions in such securities will be allocated among the fund and clients in a manner deemed fair and reasonable by the adviser the adviser will generally execute transactions for the fund on an aggregated basis when the adviser believes that to do so will allow it to obtain best execution and to negotiate more favorable commission rates or other transaction costs that might have otherwise been paid had such orders been placed independently aggregation or “bunching” describes a procedure whereby an investment adviser combines the orders of two or more clients into a single order for the purpose of obtaining better prices and lower execution costs brokerage and research services there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded on a principal basis in the overthecounter markets but the price paid by the fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in underwritten offerings the price paid by the fund includes a disclosed fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer transactions on us stock exchanges and other agency transactions involve the payment by the fund of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers also a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction transactions in nonus securities generally involve the payment of fixed brokerage commissions which are generally higher than those in the united states the purchase by the fund of participations or assignments may be pursuant to privately negotiated transactions pursuant to which the fund may be required to pay fees to the seller or forego a portion of payments in respect of the participation agreement the adviser places orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities options and futures contracts and buys and sells such securities options and futures for the fund through multiple brokers and dealers the adviser will place trades for execution only with approved brokers or dealers in effecting such purchases and sales the adviser seeks the most favorable price and execution of the fund’s orders in doing so the fund may pay higher commissions than the lowest available when the adviser believes it is reasonable to do so in seeking the most favorable price and execution the adviser having in mind the fund’s best interests considers all factors it deems relevant including price the size of the transaction the nature of the market for the security the amount of the commission the timing of the transaction taking into account market prices and trends the reputation experience and financial stability of the brokerdealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the brokerdealer in that or other transactions it has for many years been a common practice in the investment advisory business for advisers of investment companies and other institutional investors to receive research and brokerage products and services together    “services” from brokerdealers which execute portfolio transactions for the clients of such advisers consistent with this practice the adviser receives services from many brokerdealers with which the adviser places the fund’s portfolio transactions these services which in some cases also may be purchased for cash may include among other things such items as general economic and security market reviews industry and company reviews evaluations of securities recommendations as to the purchase and sale of securities and services related to the execution of securities transactions the advisory fees paid by the fund are not reduced because the adviser receives such services even though the receipt of such services relieves the adviser from expenses they might otherwise bear research and brokerage services provided by brokerdealers chosen by the adviser to place the fund’s portfolio transactions may be useful to the adviser in providing services to the adviser’s other clients although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing the fund conversely research and brokerage services provided to the adviser by brokerdealers in connection with trades executed on behalf of other clients of the adviser may be useful to the adviser in managing the fund although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing such other clients in reliance on the “safe harbor” provided by section e of the exchange act the adviser may cause the fund to pay a brokerdealer which provides “brokerage and research services” as defined for purposes of section e to the adviser an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for the fund in excess of the commission which another brokerdealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the adviser makes a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the adviser’s overall responsibilities to all discretionary accounts the adviser may place orders for the purchase and sale of exchangelisted portfolio securities with a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser where in the judgment of the adviser such firm will be able to obtain a price and execution at least as favorable as other qualified brokerdealers pursuant to rules of the sec a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser may receive and retain compensation for effecting portfolio transactions for the fund on a securities exchange if the commissions paid to such an affiliated brokerdealer by the fund on exchange transactions do not exceed “usual and customary brokerage commissions” the rules define “usual and customary” commissions to include amounts which are “reasonable and fair compared to the commission fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time” regular broker dealers the fund is required to identify the securities of its regular brokers or dealers as defined in rule b under the  act or their parent companies held by the fund as of the close of their most recent fiscal year and state the value of such holdings as of the date of this sai the fund did not hold any securities of its regular brokers or dealers or their parent companies because the fund had not yet begun investment operations tax status the following discussion of us federal income tax consequences of investment in the fund is based on the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” us treasury regulations and other applicable authority as of the date of the preparation of this sai these authorities are subject to change by legislative or administrative action possibly with retroactive effect the following discussion is only a summary of some of the important us federal income tax considerations generally applicable to investments in the fund there may be other tax considerations applicable to particular shareholders shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their particular situation and the possible application of federal state local or nonus tax laws    taxation of the fund the fund intends to elect and intends to qualify and be treated each year as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code in order to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded regulated investment companies and their shareholders the fund must among other things a derive at least  of its gross income for each taxable year from i dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gains from options futures or forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and ii net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” as defined below b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the fund’s taxable year i at least  of the value of the fund’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items us government securities securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to a value not greater than  of the value of the fund’s total assets and not more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets is invested including through corporations in which the fund owns a  or more voting stock interest x in the securities other than those of the us government or other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or y in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined below and c distribute with respect to each taxable year at least  of the sum of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid—generally taxable ordinary income and the excess if any of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and any net taxexempt interest income for such year in general for purposes of the  gross income requirement described in paragraph a above income derived from a partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership that would be qualifying income if realized directly by the regulated investment company however  of the net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” a partnership x the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and y that derives less than  of its income from the qualifying income described in paragraph ai above will be treated as qualifying income in general such entities will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes because they meet the passive income requirement under code section c in addition although in general the passive loss rules of the code do not apply to regulated investment companies such rules do apply to a regulated investment company with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership for purposes of the diversification test in b above the term “outstanding voting securities of such issuer” will include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership also for purposes of the diversification test in b above the identification of the issuer or in some cases issuers of a particular fund investment can depend on the terms and conditions of that investment in some cases identification of the issuer or issuers is uncertain under current law and an adverse determination or future guidance by the internal revenue service “irs” with respect to issuer identification for a particular type of investment may adversely affect the fund’s ability to meet the diversification test in b above in addition if the fund were to own  or more of the voting interests of a corporation the fund would be required to “look through” such corporation to its holdings and combine the appropriate percentage of such corporation’s assets with the fund’s assets for purposes of satisfying the  diversification test described in bii above gains from foreign currencies including foreign currency options foreign currency swaps foreign currency futures and foreign currency forward contracts currently constitute qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test described in a above however the treasury department has the authority to issue regulations possibly with retroactive effect excluding from the definition of “qualifying income” the fund’s foreign currency gains to the extent that such income is not directly related to the fund’s principal business of investing in stock or securities    the fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company the tax treatment of certain of the fund’s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to rics is not certain an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs might affect the fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment if the fund qualifies as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment the fund generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to its shareholders in the form of dividends including capital gain dividends as defined below if the fund were to fail to meet the income diversification or distribution tests described above the fund could in some cases cure such failure including by paying a fundlevel tax paying interest making additional distributions or disposing of certain assets if the fund were ineligible to or otherwise did not cure such failure for any year or if the fund were otherwise to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company accorded special tax treatment for such year the fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income some portions of such distributions could be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction in the case of corporate shareholders and may be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income” in the case of shareholders taxed as individuals provided in both cases that the shareholder meets certain holding period and other requirements in respect of the fund’s shares as described below in addition the fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment the fund intends to distribute to its shareholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction any net taxexempt income and any net capital gains investment company taxable income that is retained by the fund will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates the fund may also retain for investment its net capital gain if the fund retains any net capital gain it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained but it may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice mailed within  days of the close of the fund’s taxable year to its shareholders who in turn i will be required to include in income for us federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their shares of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the fund on such undistributed amount against their us federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds on properlyfiled us tax returns to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities if the fund makes this designation for us federal income tax purposes the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the fund will be increased by an amount equal under current law to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholder’s gross income under clause i of the preceding sentence and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder under clause ii of the preceding sentence the fund is not required to and there can be no assurance that the fund will make this designation if it retains all or a portion of its net capital gain in a taxable year in determining its net capital gain including in connection with determining the amount available to support a capital gain dividend as defined below its taxable income and its earnings and profits a ric generally may elect to treat part or all of any postoctober capital loss defined as any net capital loss attributable to the portion if any of the taxable year after october  or if there is no such loss the net longterm capital loss or net shortterm capital loss attributable to any such portion of the taxable year or lateyear ordinary loss generally the sum of its i net ordinary loss from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property attributable to the portion if any of the taxable year after october  and its ii other net ordinary loss attributable to the portion if any of the taxable year after december  as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year if the fund fails to distribute in a calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income for such year and  of its capital gain net income for the oneyear period ending on october  of such year plus any retained amount for the prior year the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the undistributed amounts for these purposes ordinary gains and losses from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property that would be properly taken into account after october  are treated as arising on january     of the following calendar year for purposes of the excise tax the fund will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it has been subject to corporate income tax in the taxable year ending within the calendar year a dividend paid to shareholders in january of a year generally is deemed to have been paid on december  of the preceding year if the dividend is declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in october november or december of that preceding year the fund intends generally to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the  excise tax although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so fund distributions shareholders subject to us federal income tax will be subject to tax on dividends received from the fund regardless of whether received in cash or reinvested in additional shares such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received distributions received by taxexempt shareholders generally will not be subject to us federal income tax to the extent permitted under applicable tax law for us federal income tax purposes distributions of investment income generally are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income taxes to shareholders on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the fund owned and is treated for us federal income tax purposes as having owned the investments that generated them rather than how long a shareholder has owned his or her shares in general the fund will recognize longterm capital gain or loss on investments it has owned or is deemed to have owned for more than one year and shortterm capital gain or loss on investments it has owned or is deemed to have owned for one year or less tax rules can alter the fund’s holding period in investments and thereby affect the tax treatment of gain or loss on such investments distributions of net capital gain that is the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards that are properly reported by the fund as capital gain dividends “capital gain dividends” generally will be taxable to shareholders as longterm capital gains includible in net capital gain and taxed to individuals at reduced rates distributions of net shortterm capital gain as reduced by any longterm capital loss for the taxable year will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income and shareholders will not be able to offset distributions of the fund’s net shortterm capital gains with capital losses that they recognize with respect to their other investments as required by federal law detailed federal tax information with respect to each calendar year will be furnished to each shareholder early in the succeeding year the ultimate tax characterization of the fund’s distributions made in a taxable year cannot finally be determined until after the end of that taxable year as a result there is a possibility that the fund may make total distributions during a taxable year in an amount that exceeds the fund’s “current and accumulated earnings and profits” generally the net investment income and net capital gains of the fund with respect to that year in which case the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital which will be taxfree to the holders of the shares up to the amount of the shareholder’s tax basis in the applicable shares with any amounts exceeding such basis treated as gain from the sale of such shares capital losses in excess of capital gains “net capital losses” are not permitted to be deducted against the fund’s net investment income instead potentially subject to certain limitations the fund may carry net capital losses from any taxable year forward to subsequent taxable years without expiration to offset capital gains if any realized during such subsequent taxable years capital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset currentyear net realized capital gains whether the fund retains or distributes such gains the fund must apply such carryforwards first against gains of the same character the fund’s available capital loss carryforwards if any will be set forth in its annual shareholder report for each fiscal year “qualified dividend income” received by an individual will be taxed at the rates applicable to longterm capital gain in order for some portion of the dividends received by the fund shareholder to be qualified dividend income the fund must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividend    paying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to the fund’s shares in general a dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income at either the fund or shareholder level  if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held for fewer than  days during the day period beginning on the date that is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend or in the case of certain preferred stock  days during the day period beginning  days before such date  to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property  if the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment income for purposes of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest or  if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is a not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the united states with the exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign corporation readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states or b treated as a passive foreign investment company in general distributions of investment income reported by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified dividend income by a shareholder taxed as an individual provided both the shareholder and the fund meet the holding period and other requirements described above if the aggregate qualified dividends received by the fund during any taxable year are  or more of its gross income excluding net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss then  of the fund’s dividends other than capital gain dividends will be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income it is unclear whether or to what extent distributions from the fund will constitute qualified dividend income in general dividends of net investment income received by corporate shareholders of the fund will qualify for the  dividendsreceived deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of eligible dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations for the taxable year a dividend received by the fund will not be treated as a dividend eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction  if it has been received with respect to any share of stock that the fund has held for less than  days  days in the case of certain preferred stock during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend during the day period beginning  days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock or  to the extent that the fund is under an obligation pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property moreover the dividends received deduction may otherwise be disallowed or reduced  if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to its shares of the fund or  by application of various provisions of the code for instance the dividendsreceived deduction is reduced in the case of a dividend received on debtfinanced portfolio stock generally stock acquired with borrowed funds it is unclear whether or to what extent distributions from the fund will qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction any distribution of income that is attributable to i income received by the fund in lieu of dividends with respect to securities on loan pursuant to a securities lending transaction or ii dividend income received by the fund on securities it temporarily purchased from a counterparty pursuant to a repurchase agreement that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as a loan by the fund will not constitute qualified dividend income to individual shareholders and will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate shareholders the code generally imposes a  medicare contribution tax on the net investment income of certain individuals trusts and estates to the extent their income exceeds certain threshold amounts for these purposes “net investment income” generally includes among other things i distributions paid by the fund of net investment income and capital gains as described above and ii any net gain from the sale redemption or exchange of fund shares shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this additional tax on their investment in the fund dividends and distributions on shares of the fund are generally subject to us federal income tax as described herein to the extent they do not exceed the fund’s realized income and gains “current and accumulated earnings    and profits” even though such dividends and distributions may economically represent a return of a particular shareholder’s investment such distributions are likely to occur in respect of shares purchased at a time when the net asset value of the fund reflects either unrealized gains or realized undistributed income or gains that were therefore included in the price the shareholder paid the fund may be required to distribute realized income or gains regardless of whether the fund’s net asset value also reflects unrealized losses such distributions may reduce the fair market value of the fund’s shares below the shareholder’s cost basis in those shares sale exchange or redemption of shares the repurchase sale or exchange of fund shares may give rise to a gain or loss in general any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the shareholder has held the shares for more than  months otherwise the gain or loss will generally be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss however any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as longterm rather than shortterm to the extent of any capital gain dividends received or deemed received by the shareholder with respect to the shares all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be disallowed under the code’s “wash sale” rule if other substantially identical shares of the fund are purchased within  days before or after the disposition in such a case the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss shareholders who tender all of the shares they hold or are deemed to hold in response to a periodic repurchase offer as defined in the prospectus generally will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will recognize a capital gain or loss as described in the preceding paragraph however if a shareholder tenders fewer than all of the shares it holds or is deemed to hold such shareholder may be treated as having received a distribution under section  of the code “section  distribution” unless the redemption is treated as being either i “substantially disproportionate” with respect to such shareholder or ii otherwise “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” under the relevant rules of the code a section  distribution is not treated as a sale or exchange giving rise to capital gain or loss but rather is treated as a dividend to the extent supported by the fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits with the excess treated as a return of capital reducing the shareholder’s tax basis in its fund shares and thereafter as capital gain where a redeeming shareholder is treated as receiving a dividend there is a risk that other shareholders of the fund whose percentage interests in the fund increase as a result of such redemption will be treated as having received a taxable distribution from the fund the fund’s use of cash to repurchase shares could adversely affect its ability to satisfy the distribution requirements for treatment as a ric the fund could also recognize income in connection with its liquidation of portfolio securities to fund share repurchases any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements are satisfied options futures forward contracts swap agreements hedges straddles and other transactions due to the fund’s options strategies a substantial portion of the fund’s income potentially will consist of shortterm capital gains taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them such income will not constitute qualified dividend income or qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction in general option premiums received by the fund are not immediately included in the income of the fund instead the premiums are recognized i when the option contract expires ii the option is exercised by the holder or iii the fund transfers or otherwise terminates the option eg through a closing transaction if a call option written by the fund is exercised and the fund sells or delivers the underlying security the fund generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to a the sum of the strike price and the option premium received by the fund minus b the fund’s basis in the security such gain or loss generally will be shortterm or longterm depending upon the holding period of the underlying security if securities are purchased by the fund pursuant to the exercise of a put option written by it the fund generally will subtract the premium received for purposes of    computing its cost basis in the securities purchased in either case provided the tax treatment of an option transaction is not governed by section  of the code discussed further below the gain or loss that may arise in respect of a termination of the fund’s obligation under the option other than through the exercise of the option will be shortterm gain or loss depending on whether the premium income received by the fund is greater or less than the amount paid by the fund if any in terminating the transaction thus for example if an option written by the fund expires unexercised the fund generally will recognize shortterm gain equal to the premium received certain covered call writing activities of the fund may trigger the us federal income tax straddle rules contained primarily in section  of the code very generally where applicable section  requires i that losses be deferred on positions deemed to be offsetting positions with respect to “substantially similar or related property” to the extent of unrealized gain in the latter and ii that the holding period of such a straddle position that has not already been held for the longterm holding period be terminated and begin anew once the position is no longer part of a straddle options on single stocks that are not “deep in the money” may constitute qualified covered calls which generally are not subject to the straddle rules the holding period on stock underlying qualified covered calls that are “in the money” although not “deep in the money” will be suspended during the period that such calls are outstanding thus the straddle rules and the rules governing qualified covered calls could cause gains that would otherwise constitute longterm capital gains to be treated as shortterm capital gains and distributions that would otherwise constitute “qualified dividend income” or qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction to fail to satisfy the holding period requirements and therefore to be taxed as ordinary income or fail to qualify for the  dividendsreceived deduction as the case may be the tax treatment of certain positions entered into by the fund including regulated futures contracts certain foreign currency positions and certain listed nonequity options will be governed by section  of the code “section  contracts” gains or losses on section  contracts generally are considered  longterm and  shortterm capital gains or losses “” although certain foreign currency gains and losses from such contracts may be treated as ordinary in character also section  contracts held by the fund at the end of each taxable year and for purposes of the  excise tax on certain other dates as prescribed under the code are “marked to market” with the result that unrealized gains or losses are treated as though they were realized and the resulting gain or loss is treated as ordinary or  gain or loss as applicable in addition to the special rules described above in respect of futures and options transactions the fund’s transactions in other derivative instruments eg forward contracts and swap agreements as well as any of its other hedging short sale securities loan or similar transactions may be subject to one or more special tax rules eg marktomarket notional principal contract straddle constructive sale wash sale and short sale rules these rules may affect whether gains and losses recognized by the fund are treated as ordinary or capital or as shortterm or longterm accelerate the recognition of income or gains to the fund defer losses to the fund and cause adjustments in the holding periods of the fund’s securities these rules could therefore affect the amount timing andor character of distributions to shareholders because these and other tax rules applicable to these types of transactions are in some cases uncertain under current law an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs with respect to these rules may affect whether the fund has made sufficient distributions and otherwise satisfied the relevant requirements to maintain its qualification as a regulated investment company and avoid a fundlevel tax the fund’s use of commoditylinked derivatives can be limited by the fund’s intention to qualify as a regulated investment company and can bear on the fund’s ability to so qualify income and gains from certain commoditylinked derivatives does not constitute qualifying income to a regulated investment company for purposes of the  gross income test described above the tax treatment of certain other commoditylinked instruments in which the fund might invest including “etns” and certain structured notes is not certain in particular with respect to whether income or gains from such instruments constitute qualifying income to a ric if the fund were to treat income or gain from a particular instrument as qualifying income and the income or gain were later determined not to constitute qualifying income and together with any other nonqualifying income    caused the fund’s nonqualifying income to exceed  of its gross income in any taxable year the fund would fail to qualify as a regulated investment company unless it is eligible to and does pay a tax at the fund level certain of the fund’s investments in derivative instruments and foreign currencydenominated instruments and any of the fund’s transactions in foreign currencies and hedging activities are likely to produce a difference between the fund’s book income and the sum of its taxable income and net taxexempt income if any if the fund’s book income is less than the sum of its taxable income and net taxexempt income if any the fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment and to avoid a fundlevel tax if in the alternative the fund’s book income exceeds the sum of its taxable income including realized capital gains and net taxexempt income if any the distribution if any of such excess will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the fund’s remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipient’s basis in its shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset foreign currency transactions the fund’s transactions in foreign currencies foreign currencydenominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options futures contracts and forward contracts and similar instruments may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned any such net gains could require a larger dividend toward the end of the calendar year any such net losses will generally reduce and potentially require the recharacterization of prior ordinary income distributions such ordinary income treatment may accelerate fund distributions to shareholders and increase the distributions taxed to shareholders as ordinary income any net ordinary losses so created cannot be carried forward by the fund to offset income or gains earned in subsequent taxable years taxation of the subsidiaries it is currently expected that any whollyowned subsidiary will be a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes in the case of a subsidiary that is a disregarded entity for such purposes i the fund is treated as owning the subsidiary’s assets directly ii any income gain loss deduction or other tax items arising in respect of the subsidiary’s assets will be treated as if they are realized or incurred as applicable directly by the fund and iii any distributions the fund receives from the subsidiary will have no effect on the fund’s us federal income tax liability passive foreign investment companies a passive foreign investment company “pfic” is any foreign corporation i  or more of the gross income of which for the taxable year is passive income or ii the average percentage of the assets of which generally by value but by adjusted tax basis in certain cases that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least  generally passive income for this purpose means dividends interest including income equivalent to interest royalties rents annuities the excess of gains over losses from certain property transactions and commodities transactions and foreign currency gains passive income for this purpose does not include rents and royalties received by the foreign corporation from active business and certain income received from related persons equity investments by the fund in certain pfics could potentially subject the fund to a us federal income tax or other charge including interest charges on the distributions received from the pfic or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the pfic this tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders however the fund may elect to avoid the imposition of that tax for example if the fund is in a position to and elects to treat a pfic as a “qualified electing fund” ie make a “qef election” the fund will be required to include its share of the pfic’s income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether it    receives any distribution from the pfic alternatively the fund may make an election to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in such holdings “to the market” as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in those pfics on the last day of the fund’s taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation making either of these elections therefore may require the fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the fund’s total return dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income” it is not always possible to identify a foreign corporation as a pfic and the fund may therefore incur the tax and interest charges described above in some instances foreign taxation income and proceeds received by the fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries tax treaties between certain countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes if more than  of the fund’s assets at the close of the taxable year consist of the securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to permit shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by the fund to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities that the fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the code for this purpose “securities of foreign corporations” generally includes securities of foreign governments in such cases shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes paid by the fund a shareholder’s ability to claim an offsetting foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of such foreign taxes is subject to certain limitations imposed by the code which may result in the shareholder’s not receiving a full credit or deduction if any for the amount of such taxes for example shareholders who do not itemize on their us federal income tax returns may claim a credit but not a deduction for such foreign taxes in addition shareholders that are not subject to us federal income tax and those who invest in the fund through taxadvantaged accounts including those who invest through individual retirement accounts or other taxadvantaged retirement plans generally will receive no benefit from any tax credit or deduction passed through by the fund investments in other investment companies if the fund receives dividends from another investment company including an etf that qualifies as a ric and the investment company reports such dividends as qualified dividend income then the fund is permitted in turn to report a portion of its distributions as qualified dividend income provided the fund meets holding period and other requirements with respect to shares of the investment company if the fund receives dividends from such an investment company and the investment company reports such dividends as eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction then the fund is permitted in turn to report its distributions derived from those dividends as eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction as well provided the fund meets holding period and other requirements with respect to shares of the investment company certain investments in reits and mortgagerelated securities the fund may invest in reits the fund’s investments in reit equity securities may result in the fund’s receipt of cash in excess of the reit’s earnings if the fund distributes such amounts such distribution could constitute a return of capital to fund shareholders for us federal income tax purposes dividends received by the fund from a reit will not qualify for the corporate dividendsreceived deduction and generally will not constitute qualified dividend income    short sales to the extent the fund participates in short sales by contracting for the sale of stock it does not own and later purchasing stock necessary to close the sale the character of the gain or loss realized on such a short sale is determined by reference to the property used to close the short sale and is thus generally shortterm because net shortterm capital gain after reduction by any longterm capital loss is generally taxed at ordinary income rates the fund’s short sale transactions will likely increase the percentage of the fund’s gains that are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income original issue discount payinkind securities and market discount some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance and all zerocoupon debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance will be treated as debt obligations that are issued originally at a discount generally the amount of the original issue discount “oid” is treated as interest income and is included in the fund’s taxable income and required to be distributed by the fund over the term of the debt obligation even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time ie upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security or is received in kind rather than in cash increases in the principal amount of inflationindexed bonds will also be treated as oid some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance that are acquired by the fund in the secondary market may be treated as having “market discount” very generally market discount is the excess of the stated redemption price of a debt obligation or in the case of an obligation issued with oid its “revised issue price” over the purchase price of such obligation generally any gain recognized on the disposition of and any partial payment of principal on a debt obligation having market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain or principal payment does not exceed the “accrued market discount” on such debt obligation alternatively the fund may elect to accrue market discount currently in which case the fund will be required to include the accrued market discount in the fund’s income as ordinary income and thus distribute it over the term of the debt security even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security the rate at which the market discount accrues and thus is included in the fund’s income will depend upon which of the permitted accrual methods the fund elects some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of one year or less from the date of issuance may be treated as having “acquisition discount” very generally the excess of the stated redemption price over the purchase price or oid in the case of certain types of debt obligations generally the fund will be required to include the acquisition discount or oid in income as ordinary income over the term of the debt obligation even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time ie upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security or is received in kind rather than in cash the fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt obligations having acquisition discount or oid which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income in addition paymentinkind securities will give rise to income that is required to be distributed and is taxable even though the fund holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year the fund that holds the foregoing kinds of securities may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount that is greater than the total amount of cash interest the fund actually received such distributions may be made from the cash assets of the fund or if necessary by liquidation of portfolio securities including when it is not advantageous to do so the fund may realize gains or losses from such liquidations in the event the fund realizes net capital gains from such transactions its shareholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would in the absence of such transactions    securities purchased at a premium very generally where the fund purchases a bond at a price that exceeds the redemption price at maturity ie a premium the premium is amortizable over the remaining term of the bond in the case of a taxable bond if the fund makes an election applicable to all such bonds it purchases which election is irrevocable without consent of the irs the fund reduces the current taxable income from the bond by the amortized premium and reduces its tax basis in the bond by the amount of such offset upon the disposition or maturity of such bonds the fund is permitted to deduct any remaining premium allocable to a prior period in the case of a taxexempt bond tax rules require the fund to reduce its tax basis by the amount of amortized premium higherrisk securities investments in debt obligations that are at risk of or in default present special tax issues for the fund tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as whether when or to what extent the fund should recognize market discount on a debt obligation when the fund may cease to accrue interest oid or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income these and other related issues will be addressed by the fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its eligibility for treatment as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax issuer deductibility of interest a portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield discount obligations owned by the fund may not be deductible to and thus may affect the cash flow of the issuer if a portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield discount obligations is not deductible that portion will be treated as a dividend for purposes of the corporate dividends received deduction in such cases if the issuer of the high yield discount obligations is a domestic corporation dividend payments by the fund may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction to the extent of the deemed dividend portion of such accrued interest interest paid on debt obligations owned by the fund if any that are considered for us tax purposes to be payable in the equity of the issuer or a related party will not be deductible to the issuer possibly affecting the cash flow of the issuer taxexempt shareholders income of a regulated investment company that would be ubti if earned directly by a taxexempt entity will not generally be attributed as ubti to a taxexempt shareholder of a regulated investment company notwithstanding this “blocking” effect a taxexempt shareholder could recognize ubti by virtue of its investment in the fund if shares in the fund constitute debtfinanced property in the hands of the taxexempt shareholder within the meaning of code section b foreign shareholders in general the fund’s dividends are not subject to a us withholding tax when paid to a shareholder that is not a “us person within the meaning of the code such a shareholder a “foreign shareholder” to the extent properly reported by the fund as  interestrelated dividends or shortterm capital gains dividends each as defined below and subject to certain conditions described below  capital gain dividends or  distributions treated as a return of capital with respect to such foreign shareholder the exception to withholding for “interestrelated dividends” generally applies with respect to distributions other than distributions to a foreign shareholder w that does not provide a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner is not a us person x to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain interest on an obligation if the foreign shareholder is the issuer or is a  shareholder of the issuer y that is within certain    foreign countries that have inadequate information exchange with the united states or z to the extent the dividend is attributable to interest paid by a person that is a related person of the foreign shareholder and the foreign shareholder is a controlled foreign corporation from ussource interest income of types similar to those not subject to us federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign shareholder to the extent such distributions are properly reported as such by the fund in a written notice to shareholders “interestrelated dividends” the exception to withholding for “shortterm capital gain dividends” generally applies with respect to distributions other than a distributions to an individual foreign shareholder who is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the distribution or b distributions subject to special rules regarding the disposition of us real property interests of net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses to the extent such distributions are properly reported by the fund “shortterm capital gain dividends” the fund is permitted to report such part of its dividends as interestrelated or shortterm capital gain dividends as are eligible but is not required to do so in the case of shares held through an intermediary the intermediary may withhold even if the fund reports all or a portion of a payment as an interestrelated or shortterm capital gain dividend to shareholders these exemptions from withholding will not be available to foreign shareholders of the fund if it does not currently report its dividends as interestrelated or shortterm capital gain dividends foreign shareholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts distributions by the fund to foreign shareholders other than capital gain dividends interestrelated dividends and shortterm capital gain dividends eg distributions attributable to dividends and foreignsource interest income are generally subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate under us federal tax law a foreign shareholder generally is not subject to us federal income tax on gains and is not allowed a deduction for losses realized on the sale of shares of the fund or on capital gain dividends interestrelated dividends and shortterm capital gain dividends unless i such gain or dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business carried on by such holder within the united states ii in the case of an individual holder the holder is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the sale or the receipt of the capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met or iii the special rules relating to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of “us real property interests” “usrpis” apply to the foreign shareholder’s sale of shares of the fund or to the capital gain dividend the foreign shareholder received as described below special rules would apply if the fund were a qualified investment entity “qie” because it is either a “us real property holding corporation” “usrphc” or would be a usrphc but for the operation of certain exceptions to the definition of usrpis described below very generally a usrphc is a domestic corporation that holds usrpis the fair market value of which equals or exceeds  of the sum of the fair market values of the corporation’s usrpis interests in real property located outside the united states and other trade or business assets usrpis generally are defined as any interest in us real property and any interest other than solely as a creditor in a usrphc or very generally an entity that has been a usrphc in the last five years a fund that holds directly or indirectly significant interests in reits may be a usrphc interests in domestically controlled qies including reits and rics that are qies notgreaterthan interests in publicly traded classes of stock in reits and notgreaterthan interests in publicly traded classes of stock in rics generally are not usrpis but these exceptions do not apply for purposes of determining whether a fund is a qie if an interest in the fund were a usrpi a greaterthan foreign shareholder or any foreign shareholder if shares of the fund are not considered regularly traded on an established securities market generally would be required to file a us tax return in connection with the sale of its fund shares and pay related taxes due on any gain realized on the sale moreover if the fund were a usrphc or very generally had been one in the last five years it would be required to withhold on amounts distributed to a greaterthan foreign shareholder to the extent such amounts    would not be treated as a dividend ie are in excess of the fund’s current and accumulated “earnings and profits” for the applicable taxable year such withholding generally is not required if the fund is a domestically controlled qie if the fund were a qie under a special “lookthrough” rule any distributions by the fund to a foreign shareholder attributable directly or indirectly to i distributions received by the fund from a lowertier ric or reit that the fund is required to treat as usrpi gain in its hands and ii gains realized on the disposition of usrpis by the fund would retain their character as gains realized from usrpis in the hands of the fund’s foreign shareholders and would be subject to us tax withholding in addition such distributions could result in the foreign shareholder being required to file a us tax return and pay tax on the distributions at regular us federal income tax rates the consequences to a foreign shareholder including the rate of such withholding and character of such distributions eg as ordinary income or usrpi gain would vary depending upon the extent of the foreign shareholder’s current and past ownership of the fund foreign shareholders of the fund also may be subject to “wash sale” rules to prevent the avoidance of the taxfiling and – payment obligations discussed above through the sale and repurchase of fund shares foreign shareholders should consult their tax advisors and if holding shares through intermediaries their intermediaries concerning the application of these rules to their investment in the fund foreign shareholders with respect to whom income from the fund is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the foreign shareholder within the united states will in general be subject to us federal income tax on the income derived from the fund at the graduated rates applicable to us citizens residents or domestic corporations whether such income is received in cash or reinvested in shares of the fund and in the case of a foreign corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax if a foreign shareholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to us federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the shareholder in the united states more generally foreign shareholders who are residents in a country with an income tax treaty with the united states may obtain different tax results than those described herein and are urged to consult their tax advisors in order to qualify for any exemptions from withholding described above or for lower withholding tax rates under income tax treaties or to establish an exemption from backup withholding a foreign shareholder must comply with special certification and filing requirements relating to its nonus status including in general furnishing an irs form wben or form wbene or substitute form foreign shareholders in the fund should consult their tax advisors in this regard special rules including withholding and reporting requirements apply to foreign partnerships and those holding fund shares through foreign partnerships additional considerations may apply to foreign trusts and estates investors holding fund shares through foreign entities should consult their tax advisors about their particular situation a beneficial holder of fund shares who is a foreign shareholder may be subject to state and local tax and to the us federal estate tax in addition to the federal tax on income referred to above expenses subject to  “floor” and special passthrough rules the fund will not be considered to be a “publicly offered” ric if it does not have at least  shareholders at all times during a taxable year and its shares are not treated as continuously offered pursuant to a public offering it is possible that the fund will not be treated as a “publicly offered” ric for one or more of its taxable years very generally pursuant to treasury department regulations expenses of a ric that is not “publicly offered” except those specific to its status as a ric or separate entity eg registration fees or transfer agency fees are subject to special “passthrough” rules these expenses which include direct and certain indirect advisory fees are treated as additional dividends to certain fund shareholders generally including other rics that are not “publicly offered” individuals and entities that compute their taxable income in the same manner as an individual and are    deductible by those shareholders subject to the  “floor” on miscellaneous itemized deductions and other significant limitations on itemized deductions set forth in the code backup withholding the fund generally is required to withhold and remit to the us treasury a percentage of the taxable distributions and redemption proceeds paid to any individual shareholder i who fails to properly furnish the fund with a correct taxpayer identification number ii who has underreported dividend or interest income or iii who fails to certify to the fund that he or she is not subject to such withholding the backup withholding tax rate is  backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholder’s us federal income tax liability provided the appropriate information is furnished to the irs tax basis information the fund or its administrative agent must report to the irs and furnish to the fund shareholders the cost basis information and holding period for fund shares the fund will permit fund shareholders to elect from among several irsaccepted cost basis methods including average cost in the absence of an election shareholder cost basis will be determined under the default method selected by the fund the cost basis method a shareholder elects or the cost basis method applied by default may not be changed with respect to a redemption of shares after the settlement date of the redemption fund shareholders should consult with their tax advisors to determine the best irsaccepted cost basis method for their tax situation and to obtain more information about how the new cost basis reporting rules apply to them tax shelter reporting regulations under us treasury regulations if a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to the fund’s shares of  million or more for an individual shareholder or  million or more for a corporate shareholder the shareholder must file with the irs a disclosure statement on form  direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all regulated investment companies the fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances shareholder reporting obligations with respect to foreign bank and financial accounts shareholders that are us persons and own directly or indirectly more than  of the fund by vote or value could be required to report annually their “financial interest” in the fund’s “foreign financial accounts” if any on fincen form  report of foreign bank and financial accounts shareholders should consult a tax advisor and persons investing in the fund through an intermediary should contact their intermediary regarding the applicability to them of this reporting requirement other reporting and withholding requirements sections  of the code and the us treasury regulations and irs guidance issued thereunder collectively “fatca” generally require the fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its shareholders under fatca or under an applicable intergovernmental agreement an “iga” if a shareholder fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply with fatca or an iga the fund may be required to withhold under fatca  of the distributions other than distributions properly reported as capital gain dividends the fund pays to shareholders and on or after january   which date under recent treasury guidance is expected to be delayed until on or after january    of the gross proceeds of    share redemptions or exchanges and certain capital gain dividends it pays if a payment by the fund is subject to fatca withholding the fund or its agent is required to withhold even if such payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules applicable to foreign shareholders described above eg capital gain dividends each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the applicability of fatca and any other reporting requirements with respect to the prospective investor’s own situation including investments through an intermediary in addition foreign countries are considering and may implement laws similar in purpose and scope to fatca as more fully described above shares purchased through taxqualified plans special tax rules apply to investments through defined contribution plans and other taxqualified plans shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the suitability of shares of the fund as an investment through such plans and the precise effect of an investment on their particular tax situation description of the trust the trustees are responsible for the management and supervision of the trust the declaration of trust permits the trustees to issue an unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest of the fund or other series of the trust with or without par value under the declaration of trust the trustees have the authority to create and classify shares of beneficial interest in separate series and classes without further action by shareholders as of the date of this sai the fund is the only series of the trust to the extent permissible by law additional series may be added in the future the shares of the fund represent an equal proportionate interest in the net assets attributable to such shares of the fund shareholders have certain exclusive voting rights on matters relating to their respective distribution plan if any different classes of the fund if any may bear different expenses relating to the cost of holding shareholder meetings necessitated by the exclusive voting rights of any class of shares unless otherwise required by the  act or the declaration of trust the trust has no intention of holding annual meetings of shareholders trust shareholders may remove a trustee by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the trust’s outstanding shares and the trustees shall promptly call a meeting for such purpose when requested to do so in writing by the record holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the trust shareholders may under certain circumstances communicate with other shareholders in connection with requesting a special meeting of shareholders however at any time that less than a majority of the trustees holding office were elected by the shareholders the trustees will call a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing trustees in the event of liquidation shareholders of each class are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets of the applicable fund available for distribution to these shareholders shares entitle their holders to one vote per share and fractional votes for fractional shares are freely transferable and have no preemptive subscription or conversion rights when issued shares are fully paid and nonassessable the declaration of trust disclaims shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the trust the declaration of trust further provides for indemnification out of the fund’s property for all loss and expense of any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund by reason of owning shares of the fund thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is considered remote since it is limited to circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and the fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations the declaration of trust further provides that the board will not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law however nothing in the declaration of trust protects a trustee against any liability to which the    trustee would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office the declaration of trust of the trust provides for indemnification by the trust of trustees and officers of the trust however such persons may not be indemnified against any liability to the trust or the trust’s shareholders to whom he or she would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office

offers typically for  of the fund’s outstanding shares at nav subject to approval of the board of trustees    related parties at march   the officers of the trust were also employees of the adviser    appendix a securities ratings the rating of a rating service represents the service’s opinion as to the credit quality of the security being rated however the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer consequently the adviser believes that the quality of debt securities in which the fund invests should be continuously reviewed a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor when a security has received a rating from more than one service each rating should be evaluated independently ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources which they consider reliable ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other reasons the following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by moody’s and standard  poor’s moody’s ratings aaa—obligations rated aaa are judged to be of the highest quality subject to the lowest level of credit risk aa—obligations rated aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk a—obligations rated a are judged to be uppermedium grade and are subject to low credit risk baa—obligations rated baa are judged to be mediumgrade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics ba—obligations rated ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk b—obligations rated b are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk caa—obligations rated caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk ca—obligations rated ca are highly speculative and are likely in or very near default with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest c—obligations rated c are the lowest rated and are typically in default with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest moody’s appends numerical modifiers   and  to each generic rating classification from aa through caa the modifier  indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category standard  poor’s ratings aaa—an obligation rated ‘aaa’ has the highest rating assigned by standard  poor’s the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa—an obligation rated ‘aa’ differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong   a a—an obligation rated ‘a’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb—an obligation rated ‘bbb’ exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation bb b ccc cc and c—obligations rated ‘bb’ ‘b’ ‘ccc’ ‘cc’ and ‘c’ are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics ‘bb’ indicates the least degree of speculation and ‘c’ the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb—an obligation rated ‘bb’ is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b—an obligation rated ‘b’ is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated ‘bb’ but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccc—an obligation rated ‘ccc’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc—an obligation rated ‘cc’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment the ‘cc’ rating is used when a default has not yet occurred but standard  poor’s expects default to be a virtual certainty regardless of the anticipated time to default c—an obligation rated ‘c’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment and the obligation is expected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher d—an obligation rated ‘d’ is in default or in breach of an imputed promise for nonhybrid capital instruments the ‘d’ rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due unless standard  poor’s believes that such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or  calendar days the ‘d’ rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty for example due to automatic stay provisions an obligation’s rating is lowered to ‘d’ if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer nr—this indicates that no rating has been requested or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poor’s does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy the ratings from ‘aa’ to ‘ccc’ may be modified by the addition of a plus  or minus  sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories   a appendix b stone ridge asset management llc proxy voting policies and procedures   i governing standards stone ridge asset management llc the “adviser” has adopted written proxy voting policies and guidelines “the proxy policy” as required under rule  the “rule” of the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” in addition to covering the voting of equity securities the proxy policy also applies generally to voting andor consent rights of fixed income securities including but not limited to plans of reorganization waivers and consents under applicable indentures the proxy policy which has been designed to ensure that adviser votes proxies in the best interest of its clients and provides clients with information about how their proxies are voted contains procedures to mitigate conflicts of interests between clients and adviser and its advisory affiliates when voting proxies   ii policy the proxy policy applies to those client accounts that contain voting securities and for which adviser has been delegated the authority to vote client proxies when voting proxies for client accounts adviser’s primary objective is to make voting decisions solely in the best interest on behalf of all clients for which it manages assets the adviser has selected an unaffiliated third party proxy research and voting service institutional shareholder services inc “iss” or “proxy voting service” to assist it in researching recordkeeping and voting of proxies with respect to each proxy received the proxy voting service researches the financial implications of the proposals and provides a recommendation to adviser as to how to vote on each proposal based on the proxy voting service’s research of the individual facts and circumstances and the proxy voting service’s application of its research findings to a set of guidelines iss’ us proxy voting summary guidelines these guidelines have been approved by adviser and though adviser intends to vote consistent with the voting recommendation of the proxy voting service upon the recommendation of the applicable portfolio managers adviser may determine to override any recommendation made by the proxy voting service or abstain from voting in the event that the proxy voting service does not provide a recommendation with respect to a proposal adviser may determine to vote on the proposals directly with respect to the voting of proxies relating to fixed income securities or other debt instruments the proxy policy does not apply however to consent rights that primarily entail decisions to buy or sell investments such as tender or exchange offers conversions put options redemption and dutch auctions the proxy policy is designed and implemented in a manner reasonably expected to ensure that voting and consent rights are exercised in the best interests of the funds and their shareholders adviser may determine not to vote a proxy for a debt or equity security if  the effect on the applicable economic interests or the value of the portfolio holding is insignificant in relation to an individual’s account portfolio or in the aggregate with all clients  the cost of voting the proxy outweighs the possible benefit to the applicable account including without limitation situations where a jurisdiction imposes share blocking restrictions which may affect the ability of the portfolio managers to effect trades in the related security or  adviser otherwise has determined that it is consistent with its fiduciary obligations not to vote the proxy in addition neither adviser nor the proxy voting service will be able to vote for any securities on loan by an account in the event that adviser is aware of a material vote on behalf of the mutual fund and adviser has the ability to call back loans and is aware of the securities on loan by the custodian adviser may call back the loan and vote the proxy if time permits     a firm’s advisory affiliates are defined in this policy to include  all officers partners directors or any person performing similar functions  all persons directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the adviser and  all current employees   b adviser will not accept direction on how to vote individual proxies for which it has voting responsibility from any other person or organization other than the research and information provided by its independent proxy voting service subject to specific provisions in a client’s account documentation related to exception voting in fulfilling its obligations to clients adviser will act in a manner deemed to be prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the underlying securities held in client accounts   iii conflicts of interest procedures for voting of securities adviser believes that application of the guidelines to vote proxies should in most cases adequately address any possible conflicts of interest since the guidelines are predetermined however the potential for conflicts of interest exists to the extent the portfolio managers have discretion to vote differently than the guidelines as a general practice adviser will vote in accordance with the voting recommendation provided by the proxy voting service in the event that adviser wishes to vote against the independent voting recommendation adviser requires chief compliance officer “cco” approval prior to a vote being cast for voting of fixed income securities adviser believes the potential for material conflicts of interest to arise between the interests of the client and the interests of adviser is limited however there may be a potential for a conflict of interest which adviser or its related persons or entities may be a named party to or participating in a bankruptcy workout or other similar committee with respect to the issuer in such instances the portfolio manager must notify the cco prior to casting any decision on behalf of clients upon the identification or notice received by the cco that there is a conflict of interest with respect to casting a vote the cco will discuss the proxy with the relevant portfolio managers and other senior management in order to determine if the conflict is material in instances where a portfolio manager proposes to vote a proxy inconsistent with the guidelines and a potential immaterial conflict is identified the cco will review the proxy votes in order to determine whether a portfolio manager’s voting rationale appears reasonable upon the detection of a material conflict of interest the cco has final decisionmaking authority regarding adviser’s course of action for the proxy the cco’s determination will be based on maximizing value for adviser’s clients   iv voting guidelines for accounts that invest in voting securities adviser has approved the iss’ us proxy voting summary guidelines these guidelines are intended to provide a general overview of iss’ united states policy guidelines by highlighting the key policies that iss applies to companies listed in the united states however iss’ analysis is on a casebycase basis

from time to time amend this policy andor adopt such interpretations of this policy as it deems appropriate provided however that such changes are approved by adviser management adviser will supervise

confidential except that the same may be disclosed to adviser’s management any regulatory or selfregulatory authority or agency upon its request or as required by law or court or administrative order
