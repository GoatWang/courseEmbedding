wouldn’t have the identity i have now i wouldn’t have been able to throw my bevy of emotions into something and would probably have turned out a tornado of a person and i also probably wouldn’t have struggled in the world the way an artist comes to experience art can be like the best and worst lover all in one giving you access to so much expression and at the same time can leave you stranded and feeling like you don’t matter i can confuse making art with public opinion sometimes when the need for validation leaks into my creative process i get distracted i always have to come back to this one place where creating is about me within my process and nothing else matters that’s where one truly gets lost enough to where something fantastic can be found what was your first interaction with tarot i was introduced to tarot by a deck of cards and books that my mom passed along to me from her younger days it wasn’t something that she was necessarily into but she was compelled to pass them along and i would do card readings for myself throughout the years when i would feel lost about something i would do a card reading and trust that whatever message was coming through was something i needed to hear how has tarot influenced your view of art and the creative process i’ve mostly familiarized myself with the riderwaite deck illustrations and love the idea of visual symbolism i think that both tarot and my art embrace duality the lightness and shadow of being how did the invisible light tarot begin this is the weird thing i have o idea… i really believe that it began subconsciously from an intuitive space which seems appropriate somewhere the idea began to formulate and without thinking i started to match my photographic images with the meanings and visuals from the tarot from there i just kept going it was meant to be more of a functional and different way of sharing my photography however it really took shape as an authentic tarot deck what is different about the invisible light tarot from other decks on the market i haven’t seen too many photographic tarot decks so it seemed like a unique idea to pair the two what sets mine apart really comes down to the imagery the photographs are really vibrant and timeless shot with rare and expired film stocks a lot of time and travelling went into making these images so there’s a lot of energy in these cards the book that was written by myself and my friend sarah harron which comes with the deck was also really thought out we spent many hours reading discussing and writing to come up with words that really carry the essence of what these meanings are about can you talk a bit about the soul of the deck i always feel like every deck has a personal story and spirit that permeates every image like i was saying about what went into making these images these photographs are each pieces of art that i’ve invested myself into there’s a sincerity a commitment a lot of living that’s gone into the creating of these images making art is something that allows me space to reconcile that which is trying to be understood and felt there’s so much feeling that goes into what i do how has your creative process changed since creating the invisible light tarot i think i’ve been shooting images that are more up close and personal lately but the magic that went into the invisible light tarot images is still there it’s just evolving itself into another style can you share a special way you like to use the deck maybe a ritual or some alternative technique for working with the cards… my favorite way i like working with the deck is a simple threecard spread i like to call “the conversation spread” i ask people to knock the deck with their dominant hand to get the old energies out and their energy in then pick three cards one to get the conversation started the second to elaborate and the third card is where the conversation leaves off “from the invisible light guidebook” where can people find out more about you and your work people can read more about invisible light and see some samples of cards from the deck at wwwinvisiblelighttarotcom and more of my photography at wwwbrandyeveallencom thank you so much for being here… and sharing your creative spirit with us xoxo about brandy eve allen allen’s work has been exhibited throughout italy where she also lived and worked in her twenties gaining early recognition for her photographs she continues to create bringing to bear the landscapes of central and southern california as her backdrop using film light and intuition allen draws out and captures the essence of her subject she doesn’t shy away from the violence of this world rather she uses it to invoke its opposite and her photographs are not only fearless and tender but also generous and authentic as many qualities as they take on from elegant to inquisitive to eerie allen’s work is always unflinchingly honest “beauty” allen maintains “is about transparent sincerity”

email address got it got it by radley balko by radley balko july   follow radleybalko last october shaneen allen  was pulled over in atlantic county nj the officer who pulled her over says she made an unsafe lane change during the stop allen informed the officer that she was a resident of pennsylvania and had a conceal carry permit in her home state she also had a handgun in her car had she been in pennsylvania having the gun in the car would have been perfectly legal but allen was pulled over in new jersey home to some of the strictest gun control laws in the united states allen is a black single mother she has two kids she has no prior criminal record before her arrest she worked as a phlebobotomist after she was robbed two times in the span of about a year she purchased the gun to protect herself and her family there is zero evidence that allen intended to use the gun for any other purpose yet allen was arrested she spent  days in jail before she was released on bail she’s now facing a felony charge that if convicted would bring a threeyear mandatory minimum prison term at first blush much about allen’s case seems counterintuitive when we think about the gun control debate we typically picture progressive pundits politicians and activists arguing with white conservative activists and politicians representing rural interests when i first posted her story to twitter a couple of progressive responders predicted that because allen is a black single mother the gun rights community would all but ignore her but that hasn’t been true at all in fact allen has become something of a rallying point for gun rights activists she is being represented by evan nappen an attorney who specializes in gun cases and is a gun rights activist himself some conservatives have similarly accused progressives of ignoring allen’s case because she stands accused of a gun crime it’s certainly true that her case has received much more attention from the right than the left but nappen says he has seen plenty of support for her from racial justice groups too as it turns out allen’s case isn’t unusual at all although white people occasionally do become the victims of overly broad gun laws for example see the outrageous prosecution of brian aitken also in new jersey the typical person arrested for gun crimes is more likely to have the complexion of shaneen allen than say sarah palin last year  percent of those convicted for federal gun crimes were black — a racial disparity larger than any other class of federal crimes including drug crimes in a  report on mandatory minimum sentencing for gun crimes the us sentencing commission found that blacks were far more likely to be charged and convicted of federal gun crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences they were also more likely to be hit with “enhancement” penalties that added to their sentences in fact the racial discrepancy for mandatory minimums was even higher than the aforementioned disparity for federal gun crimes in general   source us sentencing commission   some on the lawandorder right will argue here that the disproportionate number of arrests convictions and mandatory minimum sentences for black offenders is merely a reflection of the fact that black people are disproportionately likely to commit these sorts of crimes progressives will argue that the disparity reflects institutional racism in the criminal justice system there’s some truth to both but there’s no disputing the figures much of this boils down to professional discretion when a person victimizes another person with a gun the offending person has already committed a crime and in nearly every state and under federal law it is already an additional crime to use or possess a gun while doing something that is already a crime so when gun control advocates say we need to crack down on gun offenders or when they propose that we create new gun crimes they aren’t suggesting we crack down on people who use guns to rob banks or to commit murders we already go after those people what they’re proposing is that we target people who possess sell or transport guns not because they want to hurt people with them but for reasons ranging from what most reasonable people would believe to be justifiable like shaneen allen to what gun control proponents would likely consider objectionable the gun shop owners and gun manufacturers who make money selling weapons if you’re an advocate for gun control you could certainly argue that the tradeoff here is worth it there’s an argument to be made that we still need to target irresponsible gun owners and gun merchants even if they aren’t using guns to victimize people because their guns could end up in the hands of people who do but if you’re going to make that argument you also need to understand that prosecuting people under these circumstances means that we’ll be putting more people in prison and who those people are will reflect all of the biases prejudices and predispositions present in the laws we already have it will also mean giving a lot more discretion to law enforcement officials and prosecutors when someone robs a bank with a gun or kills someone with a gun there’s no debate about who needs to be investigated and prosecuted when a police agency is charged to seek out and prosecute people who are illegally possessing or transferring guns they’re required to use their own discretion when it comes to what communities to target and what methods they’ll use to target them inevitably this will manifest as sting operations against communities with little political clout or just as troubling deliberately targeting people for political reasons just this week an incredible investigation by usa today reporter brad heath demonstrated just how this plays out in the real world the nation’s top gunenforcement agency overwhelmingly targeted racial and ethnic minorities as it expanded its use of controversial drug sting operations a usa today investigation shows the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives has more than quadrupled its use of those stings during the past decade quietly making them a central part of its attempts to combat gun crime the operations are designed to produce long prison sentences for suspects enticed by the promise of pocketing as much as  for robbing a drug stash house that does not actually exist at least  of the people agents have locked up using those stings were racial or ethnic minorities usa today found after reviewing court files and prison records from across the united states nearly all were either black or hispanic that rate is far higher than among people arrested for bigcity violent crimes or for other federal robbery drug and gun offenses the atf operations raise particular concerns because they seek to enlist suspected criminals in new crimes rather than merely solving old ones giving agents and their underworld informants unusually wide latitude to select who will be targeted in some cases informants said they identified targets for the stings after simply meeting them on the street heath points out that a federal judge recently accused the agency of “trolling poor neighborhoods” in search of patsies in some cases the atf — the federal agency that exists to fight gun crime — actually supplied its targets with the guns the agents would then arrest them for using to rob stash houses — which were also set up by the atf in april of last year the milwuakee journal sentinel reported that atf agents in milwaukee had set up a fake store front then convinced a black man with brain damage to set up illegal gun and drug sales they later arrested him for those crimes at the time the atf told the milwaukee journalsentinel that the sting was an isolated incident it wasn’t the paper later discovered similar sting operations targeting minorities and mentally disabled people all over the country in the s gun rights activists accused the atf of explicitly targeting people for their advocacy with plenty of evidence to back their claims often with violent and destructive raids on their homes you needn’t be a second amendment purist to understand the implications of using the discretion that comes with enforcing victimless crimes to target people for their political views any more than you need to be a racial justice activist to understand the injustice of using the same discretion and the same laws to primarily target people of color people whose mental capacity makes them particularly susceptible to persuasion or people who lack the clout or resources to defend themselves one could argue that the gun laws don’t need to be enforced in a racially discriminatory manner or in the catastrophically inept manner we’ve seen at the atf but you enforce the gun laws with the institutions you have not the institutions you want if we’re going to enforce gun laws that require discretion on the part of investigators and prosecutors — and add new laws to boot — we can only consider the demonstrated history of how investigators and prosecutors have used that discretion not some idealized prosecutor or atf investigator that we’d want to be in charge discretion is a a big factor in the allen case too according to nappen atlantic county prosecutor jim mcclain could have put allen in a diversionary program for firsttime offenders of victimless crimes that would have allowed her to avoid jail time he didn’t “let’s remember shaneen allen volunteered to the police officer that she had a gun and a permit” nappen says “this isn’t something she was trying to hide she didn’t think she’d done anything wrong this was a victimless crime and it’s just unconscionable that they’re putting her and her family through all of this it could all be avoided” nappen says mcclain has yet to give a reason for refusing to allow allen into the diversionary program mcclain’s office did not respond to a request for comment the atf is of course a federal agency shaneen allen was arrested under new jersey law nappen says he doesn’t know of any demographic data on gun arrests and prosecutions in new jersey but it’s an area of law in which he specializes and he says by his estimate the state figures probably mirror the federal data “the institutional racism in our gun control laws is rampant it goes back to the post civil war era when the laws were passed to keep black people and american indians from arming themselves” nappen adds that the national gun control laws passed in the late s were in response to racial riots taking place across the country it’s a sentiment echoed by the progressive author and investigative reporter robert sherrill who conceded in his book “the saturday night special” that the laws were more about “black control” than gun control and more recently in nicholas johnson’s justpublished book “negroes and the gun” it’s also worth noting that the crime control policy most wellknown widely loathed and roundly condemned by racial justice activists — the new york police department’s stopandfrisk policy — is at heart a gun control initiative its most highprofile champion is former mayor michael bloomberg also a highprofile proponent of gun control laws like those in new jersey of course none of this necessarily means that gun control advocates are wrong it’s certainly possible that despite these flaws a more robust system of gun control in the united states could net more good than harm but make no mistake more gun laws and more enforcement of victimless gun crimes will mean more people in prison those new prisoners will be disproportionately black and hispanic these realities need to be part of the discussion as for shaneen allen nappen says he is still hoping that mcclain has a change of heart and allows her to enter the diversion program if not they will go to trial nappen says allen is also protected by an amnesty period passed into law that allowed gun owners to surrender their weapons from august  to february  without fear of punishment whether allen technically “surrendered” her weapon is a legal question but if she is denied that defense she will almost certainly go to trial and under new jersey’s gun law she will have no real defense unless her jury engages in a defiant act of nullification she will be convicted and her trial judge will have no choice but to sentence her to the threeyear minimum at that point her only hope will be to appeal to the new jersey governor for clemency or a pardon current new jersey gov chris christie commuted the sentence for brian aitken whom nappen also represented aitken’s case inspired a lot of outrage but it didn’t result in any change in the law so we’re back to discretion discretion is a doubleedged sword used properly it can help avoid the unjust outcomes that will fall through the cracks when applying a uniform criminal code to a large population but when enforcing victimless crimes police and prosecutorial discretion can quickly become a tool of injustice even of systematic oppression unless the laws like those in new jersey are changed people like brian aitken and shaneen allen will continue to be wholly at the mercy and discretion of police prosecutors and governors —and thus subject to all the biases and prejudices of the people who hold those positions correction this post originally identified allen as a phlebologist she is actually a phlebotomist opinions thewatch orlando shooting updates news and analysis on the deadliest mass
