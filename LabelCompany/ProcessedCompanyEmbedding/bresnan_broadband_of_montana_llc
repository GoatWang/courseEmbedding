our  step process why incorporate general faqs our guaranteethe benefits of incorporatingincorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to

our  step process why incorporate general faqs our guaranteethe benefits of incorporatingincorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business
