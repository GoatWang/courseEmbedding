at compass analyst associate vice president about history news team browse home  our firm  history history a history of compass partners   compass partners was founded by stephen m waters in  to combine the broad experience international reach and global relationship network of a major investment bank with the independence agility and personalized attention of a boutique firm   waters began his investment banking career at lehman brothers in  cofounding its mergers and acquisitions ma department in  becoming a partner in  and serving as codirector of the department from  to  he then moved to morgan stanley and ran its ma department from  to  before serving as cochief executive officer of morgan stanley europe he held that role from  to  in addition to serving on morgan stanley’s worldwide person operating committee   during an era of unprecedented growth of the major investment banks waters advised some of the largest multinational companies in the world ma departments grew from fewer than  people to over  and analyst classes grew from a mere handful to over  the resultant institutions often became characterized by bureaucracy internal political battles dysfunctional management and poor treatment of junior personnel in a relentless effort to pitch and bring in deals despite this growth advisory businesses declined in importance inside the major investment banks as a result of the immense profitability generated by lending and proprietary trading conflicts of interest became inevitable as many major investment banks became more interested in generating fees and trading profits than providing sound impartial advice to clients    to counter these trends and avoid the conflicts of interest inherent in large multiproduct financial institutions waters founded compass with a team of exceptional and likeminded professionals from around the world compass is focused on only two things providing good advice and making good investments our clients repeatedly return because of this focus the compass culture is friendly collegial entrepreneurial and focused on excellence – as should be expected from an entity clients are relying on for advice   although the firm has seen many successes on both the advisory and investing sides it has chosen to maintain a low profile   in its advisory business compass has completed over  transactions representing over  billion in aggregate transaction value the firm’s transactions encompass a diverse range of industries including airlines automotive consumer products energy financial services industrials media real estate technology and telecom   on the investing side of the business the first compass private equity fund focused on european industrial assets deployed  million in seven investments comprising  transactions and returned  billion to its investors leave a reply click here to cancel reply you must be logged in to post a comment recent commentsmeta log in entries rss comments rss wordpressorg
