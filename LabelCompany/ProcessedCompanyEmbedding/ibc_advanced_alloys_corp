scandium applications project wed   pm comments by marketwired niocorp developments ltd and ibc advanced alloys corp announce that they have entered into a joint development agreement to investigate and develop applications for scandiumcontaining alloys for multiple downstream markets scandium is a transition metal element  that can provide many powerful benefits to industries such as commercial aviation automotive precision manufacturing defense electronics and others when alloyed with aluminum for example it can increase the strength and weldability of the aluminum used in commercial airliners which in turn can reduce a planes weight fuel consumption and emissions per passenger mile ong commodities llc ong has estimated that  million of scandium oxide in a boeing ng singleaisle airliner can offer  million of net present value in fuel savings alone stimate is based on a bng flying  hours per year and a longterm jet fuel price of gallon savings potential is greater in longhaul aircraft with higher overall utilization scandium is scarcely used today because global production is severely constrained and unreliable the us geological survey recently estimated that only  tonnes  us tons per year of scandium are now produced however independent experts such as ong estimate that latent demand in the aerospace and solid oxide fuel cell sectors alone is several hundred tonnes per year examples of scandium material and a scandium cube image credit alchemisthp  wikimedia commons niocorp expects to come online as one of the worlds leading producers of scandium from its elk creek nebraska superalloy materials project potentially producing as much as  tonnesyear  tonsyear ibc is a leading advanced alloys company that produces highperformance alloys in a range of product forms for multiple industries and platforms including cast components for the f joint strike fighter the joint development agreement announced today signals the companies intent to collaborate in ensuring a reliable and secure us supply of scandium and catalyzing greater scandium use across a variety of industries president of ibc engineered materials chris huskamp will be leading the joint development effort for ibc huskamp is a former boeing associate technical fellow in advanced metallic processes who is credited as a named coinventor of two pending patents regarding scandiumbearing aluminum

initiative for niocorp honan is leading the effort to develop and build niocorps niobium  scandium  titanium mine and processing facility in nebraska and has more than a decade of experience in producing advanced materials that are used in highperformance alloys this joint development effort should deliver value both to niocorp and ibc and it highlights the powerful industrial logic of an upstream materials company jointly developing applications with a downstream advanced alloys producer like ibc said mark a smith ceo and executive chairman of niocorp niocorp intends to establish a secure and reliable supply chain for scandium and our partnership with ibc will leverage our ability to simultaneously accelerate applications development and market uptake of our scandium production advanced alloys are continuing to revolutionize many industries and ibcs strategic goal is to catalyze new applications for scandiumcontaining alloys so that we can expand our markets beyond those we are now able to address with advanced beryllium and copper alloys said major general david duncan heinz usmc ret ceo of ibc the establishment of a reliable and secure scandium supply chain from niocorp in the united states coupled with our teams worldclass experience with scandiumcontaining and other advanced alloys make this joint development effort very attractive for our two companies and for us industries as a whole we intend to grow a whole new class of advanced products made here in the us from our superalloys heinz said not only will ibc products help meet a growing market demand for advanced alloys but they also will help address some of the worlds greatest problems such as climate change and reliance on fossil fuels by providing greater strength and reduced weight our

annealing process by automating many aspects of annealing that previously were done manually by removing operator variability this unit also will improve product consistency and will allow us to deliver to our customers more consistent heattreated properties from batch to batch across our copper alloy product linedesigned and built by htf inc of sturgeon bay wisconsin the unit is a gasfired loader box style furnace that was uniformity tested to ams this will allow ibc to meet demand for copper alloy products that must be heat treated to amsh api a and astm b and b specifications one such industry where copper alloy products generally must meet these and other specifications is the oil and gas industry which is experiencing growth as evidenced by significantly higher rig counts over the past yeari ibc currently produces copper alloy products for the oil and gas industry is seeking to expand sales into that sectorthe effort by the copper alloys team to get this advanced system operational has been exceptional and comes at an important time as it expands our capabilities and potential reach into key markets for our copper alloy products said major general duncan heinz usmc
